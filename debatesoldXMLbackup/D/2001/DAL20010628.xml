      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, l wish to inform the House that we are joined in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery by the Honourable Peter Milliken, Speaker of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Canada, accompanied by five members of the Canadian Federal Parliament at Ottowa.</P>
      <P>It is an honour for me to extend to you, Mr. Speaker, and to your delegation, a warm welcome to Dáil Éireann. There are many historical and ethnic ties between our two countries which can be traced back to the sixth century. Over the past 15 centuries these ties have grown and strengthened and your visit is a further significant step in the advancement of these ties of co-operation and friendship between our two Parliaments. I express the confident hope that this visit will be to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to think that Michael Moynihan is no longer with us. He was an extraordinary man. As the House will know, he died early yesterday morning having been ill for some time. I had the honour to be with him on Monday morning when I visited Killarney to preside over the selection convention for his daughter, Deputy Breda Moynihan-Cronin. When she called me she said he hung on until the end to make sure that the convention would go well and that everything would be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Michael Moynihan was a giant of a man, in stature and in strength, in compassion and commitment and in his unrelenting dedication to the service of the people of his beloved south Kerry. To many in this House, he was an extraordinary <Col N="738" /> man of strength and tenacity. He first stood for election in 1954 and thereafter in 1957, 1961 and 1965. He narrowly lost a by-election in 1966 and understandably stepped aside in 1969. He fought again in 1973 and did not succeed in being elected to this House until 1981. Having heard that, this House will know the strength and tenacity of his determination to serve the people of south Kerry. Mike Moynihan, as he was known in his native Kerry, built the Labour Party around the Labour movement in that part of the country. At the selection convention one of his long-time comrades, Pat O'Leary, spoke of how he organised the workers in the small creameries characteristic of agriculture during the 1940s and 1950s. They were on their knees and forced to work six and a half days a week with no over-time, holiday pay or any of the benefits we now take for granted. All of those things had to be wrung from farmers who, in their conservatism, denounced him as a dangerous communist radical who would upset the order of the entire country, let alone the profits and balance sheets of their beloved creameries. He won through and gained the respect and affection of his people.</P>
    <P>Had he been allowed to serve on the county council, a right denied him as a psychiatric nurse until the establishment of the health boards meant he was no longer technically an employee of the council, he would doubtless have entered this House sooner. Following his arrival in this House he was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for tourism. Anybody who worked with him, or learned of and saw his dedication in promoting the interests of Kerry, will agree that he was a wonderful man.</P>
    <P>To his wife, Mai, his constant companion, political associate and tireless worker, I extend our deepest sympathies. To his two daughters, Catherine and Breeda, and his three sons, Maurice, John and Mike, on behalf of the Labour Party, we also extend our deepest condolences. We offer heartfelt thanks for a life of service, selflessly given in the interests of the people of Kerry who loved him so much and whom he loved equally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf I extend my sympathy to the family of the late Michael Moynihan. He was, as Deputy Quinn said, a distinguished Member of this House and he died yesterday morning after a long illness. I also express my sympathy to the Labour Party of which Michael Moynihan was such a valued member for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Michael Moynihan had a long career in local and national politics, both as a Member of the Seanad and the Dáil. He was also a Minister of State for tourism. He served in the Dáil from 1981 to 1987 and from 1989 to 1992. He was extremely proud of his native Kerry and he was well qualified, therefore, to become a Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and <Col N="739" /> Tourism and to be allowed to extol the virtues of the Kingdom, which he did with great relish. Michael Moynihan battled hard for his constituents, often in very difficult circumstances, and he typified all that is good about public service. His daughter, Breeda, now represents the same constituency and she has carried on the tradition of service he exemplified so well. I extend my sympathies to her and to her mother, Mai, her sister Catherine and her brothers, Maurice, Michael and John. Kerry, the Labour Party and Irish politics have lost a valued and much loved person in Michael Moynihan. May he rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend sympathy on my behalf, on behalf of Fianna Fáil and on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a constituency colleague of the late Michael Moynihan who is unable to be here due to a prior commitment in Belfast, to Mai Moynihan, widow of the late Michael Moynihan and to our colleague, Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin, on the death of her father.</P>
      <P>I knew Michael Moynihan very well. It has been said that he was a man of considerable stature and substance. He was a scion of a man that was typical of rural Deputies of that era: a grámhar man of tremendous integrity and commitment to his constituency. He was well loved by his constituents and he typified many people who expend considerable effort in seeking public office and election to the Dáil. After many attempts he finally made in 1981. That was a short term but he continued and was re-elected on a number of occasions. He was also a Member of the Seanad for many years. He was Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and always gave a very good image of Ireland and particularly his beloved Kerry and Killarney in that capacity. I extend my sympathy and that of the Fianna Fáil Party to his wife, Mai, his sons, Maurice, Michael and John and his daughters, Catherine and our colleague, Breeda.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a great privilege for me to serve here with the late Michael Moynihan and to serve in Government with him in the 1980s. He was a big man in every sense of the word and he was a public servant in every sense also. Long before he was elected to the Dáil he had been giving distinguished service by way of his trade union activities for many years. He was typical of a brand of people who helped to build up this country from very difficult times in the 1920s and who contributed in no small way to our economic success. He was a man of great courtesy and charm and we were all privileged to serve with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a contemporary of Dan Spring rather than Dick Spring and Dan Spring was another big man from Kerry. Michael Moynihan and Dan Spring upheld Labour principles in north and <Col N="740" /> south Kerry for many years but Michael Moynihan had to wait many years before he was elected. He was elected with Dick Spring in 1981. As we mark his passing, I can honestly say it was a privilege to know him and to serve with him. He will be a big loss to the people of Kerry and the Labour Party and in particular to his wife, Mai, and his sons and daughters. It is lucky for the House that his daughter continues to give that public service which he so greatly exemplified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, I also wish to extend sincere sympathy to the family of the late Michael Moynihan and to the Labour Party on the loss of a heroic member. Michael Moynihan will be known to many Members as someone who typified what is known in politics as hard graft. He worked tenaciously from a position in which it was difficult to imagine a Labour Deputy in his area to one where it is expected that there ought to be a Labour Deputy. That is an achievement which demands enormous respect and will be remembered.</P>
      <P>I spoke to colleagues in the Killarney area this morning and he will be remembered mostly as an approachable, friendly person who was a gentleman. He will also be remembered in the Killarney area as being the father of Killarney UDC for many years. He was a fatherly figure in every sense of the word. When the Green Party won its first local authority seat in 1985 on Killarney UDC with the youngest member at that time, 23 year old Marcus Counihan, it was Michael Moynihan, the supportive father figure of the UDC, who made the new member welcome. That showed how politics could be compassionate as well as hard-fought. During the co-option when Marcus Counihan had to resign from the UDC, Michael Moynihan was determined that the integrity of the seat would stay with the Green Party in the face of self-serving people who argued with him. Michael Moynihan will stand as a person of integrity among all parties because of his stand at that time.</P>
      <P>He will also be remembered as someone who set an example on how to bridge the differences of opinion between town and country. In his beloved Kerry there are many people who will remember him as a neighbour and friend regardless of their background or political viewpoints. He was well regarded in both Gaeltacht and Galltacht, in town and country, and few politicians can demand that kind of common appeal and love. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party in Kerry I would like to join in the tributes to the former Deputy Michael Moynihan, who was a very close personal friend of mine since I entered politics. He was a true gentleman of Irish politics. He never indulged in personalised attacks and as a result he was respected by members of all parties in south Kerry. He served his party with rare commitment and determi<Col N="741" /> nation. This was exemplified in the number of times he was prepared to seek election to the Dáil before eventually prevailing. He probably would have held the record for the number of times he ran for election before succeeding and he succeeded because he was a great worker. He was a man of the people and for the people and he was respected by people all classes in south Kerry.</P>
      <P>He gave unselfish commitment to his people and at all times put them first. I join with other Members in expressing my sympathies to Breeda and the rest of the Moynihan family. It is a great loss for them but they can look on him as someone who served his people well at all times and who put their interests first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. As Deputy Gormley has already raised this point, I speak in support of the concerns that he and the Labour Party have with regard to the way in which this measure is being pushed through the House. Fundamental democratic rights of local authorities and local communities are being stripped away by the Government. Fianna Fáil backbenchers do not know the full contents or consequences of this legislation. I know that I will hear their cries of innocence six months down the road in local authorities throughout the country. They will say, &ldquo;It was not me, Lord, it was not me,&rdquo; because they did not see the Bill at this time. They have an obligation, as members of the majority party in government, to ensure this Bill gets the scrutiny it deserves before we embark down this road. For that reason we are opposed to taking this item. This Administration proposes to ram through, by means of a guillotine or otherwise, 23 Bills between now and the end of the session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to strongly associate Fine Gael with the remarks made by Deputies Gormley and Quinn. The Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which is anti-democratic in nature, will have severe consequences for the people of this country and it is symptomatic of what went wrong during the Nice treaty referendum campaign. People now believe they have no control over their affairs and the Bill is simply another step in the wrong direction.</P>

      <P>We all witnessed the undemocratic way the Government conducted the Nice treaty referendum campaign and we are witnessing it here again as it seeks to ram through this legislation. The Government's behaviour will have far-reaching consequences and makes a mockery of parliamentary <Col N="745" /> democracy. I urge the Tánaiste to reconsider the position because we need to deal with the Bill in far greater detail. The proposal put before us is not the way we should do business. If Fianna Fáil backbenchers have not yet read the Bill they should do so immediately because they will be obliged to face their constituents in the future and answer their <Col N="746" /> questions. They cannot wash their hands of this matter.</P>

      <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, rings hollow for us. We object to taking it here because on issues such as the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill or the Planning and Development Act we are or were denied access to the Committee Stage debate unless someone gives us a place which cannot be taken for granted. This is inequitable. We cannot subscribe to taking the legislation in question as there is an uneven playing pitch in public office.</P>

      <P>Does the Government have a coherent policy on decentralisation? Have specific decisions been taken? If so, what counties or towns will benefit? Is the Tánaiste aware of comments by the Fianna Fáil candidate in the Tipperary South by-election that the Taoiseach made commitments to him about this? Was she consulted about the matter? Can she confirm there is a commitment, and will she make a full statement on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On decentralisation, the country, the Civil Service and the delivery of public services would be better served if an objective set of criteria were drawn up ranking all interested towns and rating them on the basis of their assets in terms of communications, transportation links, available school spaces, residential facilities and the like. Economic indicators suggesting the difficulties of towns such as Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir in contrast to other towns should also be taken into account. On that basis an objective league table of around 30 towns could be ranked in order. Then the 10,000 civil servants that the Minister for Finance has indicated will be decentralised after the next election could be allocated on a rational, fair and transparent basis unlike the summary placement of civil servants in Cahirciveen by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, simply because he is in the position to so do. Given the lack of clout of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, in Tipperary South, does the Tánaiste agree that for so long as the present patronage system of decentralisation exists within Fianna Fáil there will never be decentralisation to that constituency? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to decentralisation and a Cabinet sub-committee, of which I am a member, is considering the mat<Col N="748" /> ter. That committee has appointed a number of public servants to look at the criteria, such as those mentioned by Deputy Quinn, and to make recommendations to the Government which it will consider shortly. We must ensure that public services are delivered in an efficient manner which is the <i>raison d'être</i> of the public service in the first instance. Decentralisation can generate economic activity in areas of the country that may not have done as well as others in recent times and it can also relieve pressure, particularly on the capital. Decentralisation will be carried out bearing in mind the spatial strategy undertaken by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who is also a member of the sub-committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Tánaiste is not misleading the House deliberately but is she aware that the Minister for Finance told the Committee on Finance and the Public Service over a year ago that the Government's decision on decentralisation would be announced by July 2000? It is now one year later and we are still awaiting the decision. I agree with her that Dublin will benefit as much from decentralisation as other parts of the country because it is so overcrowded. It is a matter of urgency, from a Dublin point of view, to ease the pressure there as quickly as possible. Can she explain why there is such a long delay in making these decisions? Is there a battle between Members of the Government as to which town gets what? Does she not agree that these matters should be decided objectively and the Government should accept outside recommendations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste:</NameTxt>

      <P>After four years in Government and at a time of unprecedented economic growth is the Tánaiste not ashamed to hear an eminent consultant say on our national airwaves this morning that we have the worst cancer service in Europe? It is worse than Bulgaria, Turkey, Portugal and Greece. Does she not feel a sense of shame that people in the south-east who need an oncology service must travel to Dublin or Cork and take their place on already overcrowded waiting lists for the provision of those services? Recently one person was told that she could not begin to receive treatment for a life-threatening cancer in the bowel for at least three weeks. She was sent home in the knowledge that inside her body there was a cancer eating away at her. She could not get treatment for another three weeks because of the crisis in our public service. Is the Tánaiste not ashamed to be presiding over the collapse of our cancer services after four years of <Col N="749" /> unprecedented wealth? What, if anything, would she say to the people we have met in parts of Waterford and Wexford who have brought it to our attention that they cannot get the services for which they have paid?</P>

Does she agree that it is totally unacceptable that people with serious illness have to go to court to get their rights and to get the sort of service we all took for granted five or six years ago? Does she accept that the health service, under this Government, seems to be going into reverse and despite the fact that much more money is being spent on it, the outcomes are worse and that is down to bad management and leadership by the Minister? Can she give us an assurance that no other seriously ill patient will ever again have to go to court to get the urgent treatment he or she needs?</P>

I draw her attention to another problem in the health services. I have a letter from Dr. Foley-Nolan, a consultant rheumatologist in the same area. He has informed my colleague and Deputy Leader, Deputy Howlin, that public patients seeking rheumatology care will now have to wait up to three years for their first appointment &ndash; three years in pain. If I am tetchy can the Tánaiste imagine what someone in pain 24 hour of the day for three years would be like? Is this Government the sovereign Government of this Republic or is it not? Ultimately we have a Minister for Health and Children who has collective responsibility shared by the Tánaiste. Will the Tánaiste try to persuade the Taoiseach to bring to the health services the same degree of focus and dedicated attention he has brought to the national stadium project in Abbotstown? The Government does not care. If it cared, instead of <Col N="751" /> shifting the buck as Deputy Martin did so eloquently on the radio this morning, it would bring the same degree of focus and project management to the matter, and the likes of Paddy Tehan etc. would be involved, but it is not doing what it ought to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow Deputy Collins speak in five minutes.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, the Government, as outlined in the statement Waste Management: Changing our Ways, is committed to a dramatic reduction of the reliance on landfill as a means of waste management. The overall policy is grounded in an internationally recognised hierarchy of options. These include prevention, minimisation, re-use, recycling, energy recovery and the environmentally sustainable disposal of waste, which cannot be prevented or recovered. The policy statement commits the Government to a reduction in the reliance on the use of landfills in favour of an integrated waste management infrastructure, which will have ambitious waste recycling and recovery targets over the next 15 years.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a legal obligation to make waste management plans since the commencement of the Waste Management Act in July 1996. There has been considerable effort and expense at local, regional and national levels to delivering effective plans. From the outset, local authorities were encouraged to adopt a regional approach to the planning process with a view to a more efficient and cost-effective provision of services and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The waste management plan was developed in accordance with all the relevant provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996, including an extensive two-stage consultation process on the proposed plans. As the strategy and draft proposal state regional plans are about better integrated waste management services for the regions. The strategy provides for maximum achievable recycling and only then will thermal treatment or landfill be considered. The plans address issues such as waste minimisation, prevention, education and awareness. Targets in a typical waste management plan include recycling 40% to 60% of waste, incineration of 25% and land disposal of 14% to 20% of it. Certain local authority areas aim to provide two or three bins for recycling of different types of waste, which is welcome. Although it is a labour-intensive way of dealing with rubbish we must ensure that recycling is used to minimise the amount of waste we dispose of.</P>
      <P>Three of the 15 local authority regional groups have refused to adopt the proposed regional plans. Two of the regional groups that accepted the plans only did so with potentially serious qualifications. The problematic nature of waste management is recognised, as is the controversy associated with virtually all proposals for new waste infrastructure. An example of the latter is thermal treatment, a small element of the waste management plan that has attracted considerable attention. I thank Members for allowing me to speak and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan for sharing his time with me. This Government's waste management policy framework is set out in <Col N="756" /> a 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways. The thrust of the statement is the need for a dramatic reduction in the reliance on landfill sites in favour of a more integrated waste management approach. Such a new approach will utilise a range of waste treatment options which could deliver on ambitious recycling and recovery targets.</P>
      <P>The policy statement contends that adequate infrastructure is required to facilitate the achievement of targets in the next 15 years. The targets include a diversion of 50% of household waste away from landfill sites, a minimum reduction of 65% of biodegradable waste consigned to landfill, the development of waste recovery facilities employing environmentally beneficial technologies as an alternative to landfill including the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum, the recycling of 35% of municipal waste and the renationalising of municipal landfills leading to an integrated network of 20 state of the art facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the Waste Management Act, 1996, local authorities are required to prepare waste management plans. Comprehensive planning is under way at local and regional levels to identify the necessary infrastructure and investment requirements. Most local authorities are or have been engaged in the preparation of regional waste management plans based in many cases on regional strategy studies which address the scope for the provision of new integrated waste management infrastructures. It is estimated that a minimum of £650 million will be needed to give effect to the requirements identified, such as the provision of new infrastructure. Appropriate facilities are vital in areas such as environmental protection and industrial development, where the lack of appropriate infrastructure hinders development. Recent economic growth has placed a strain on existing waste management infrastructure and extensive investment is required as a result. If the investment does not take place in a timely fashion, our economic development may be jeopardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of our environment is a key national and EU priority. Management of water resources and the treatment of waste are key elements of any environmental protection programme. The provision of effective water and waste water infrastructure is essential to meet social, public health and environmental protection needs. It will allow the development of new houses and the industrial and services sectors, help to attract foreign investment and strengthen the food and tourism industries by allowing us to market Ireland as a clean country. I welcome the allocation in the national development plan of £3.6 billion for environmental investment between 2000 and 2006. This covers a range of important economic programmes, such as improvement in water supplies, the provision of better treatment facilities for waste water and the <Col N="757" /> promotion of better waste management. Tourism plays an important role in our economy. Strong environmental programmes will be needed if we are to ensure we retain and increase the numbers of tourists coming here each year.</P>
    <P>Economic and social development should not take place to the detriment of environmental quality. The national development plan takes into account the need for balance between various issues of environmental development embodied in the notion of sustainable development. The integration of environmental considerations in other policies is a key way of securing this balance. Environmental considerations associated with economic development are also being addressed in the national development plan. The national spatial strategy is being prepared to secure sustainable spatial development in the long-term. While we have retained good environmental and economic growth, changing lifestyles place great pressure on the environment. Investment has resulted in many improvements, however, including a better quality of drinking water, improvements in sewerage treatment facilities, reductions in lead emissions from vehicles, more recycling of packaging waste, less use of chemical fertilisers and a growth in participation in the REP scheme.</P>
    <P>It is clear that environmental protection is central to an ambit of Government policies. All new proposals and policy programmes put forward for enactment are being eco-audited. It is important we ensure environmental considerations are taken on board at every opportunity. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government takes environmental issues seriously. With a growing population, smaller household sizes and a doubling in industrial production between 1991 and 1998, there is increased demand for housing, services, infrastructure and energy. Greater consumption is placing pressure on resources and increasing waste generation. New waste infrastructure has to be put in place if we are to ensure that waste is dealt with in an environmentally friendly manner.</P>
    <P>The principal objective of this Bill is to provide a mechanism to allow the completion of the current waste management planning process. Other central aims of the Bill are to provide that the making and adopting of waste management plans becomes an executive function of local authorities, establish an environmental fund from revenue raised from new levies and put in place technical amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 and the Litter Pollution Act, 1997. The drawing up of waste management plans will now become an executive function, which is an amendment to the Waste Management Act, 1996. To vary or replace a waste management plan will require the consent of a county manager within four years of its making. In the event of failure to do so within the specified time the function will revert to the manager of the authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> The Bill also allows for the intensification of the use of waste disposal facilities operated by urban district councils. An environmental fund managed and controlled by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be established. The Bill also provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may use money from the fund for a range of measures including programmes or schemes to prevent or reduce waste as well as provide money for waste recovery activities, litter prevention, environment partnership projects and environmental awareness education and training initiatives. Money will be paid into the fund through environmental levies which will be imposed following the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill clarifies the licensing requirements for certain waste recovery and disposal facilities by eliminating a duplication of requirements under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the Waste Management Act, 1996. Waste recovery and disposal facilities will be licensed by the EPA under the 1996 Act except where the facilities are connected or associated with an activity which is, or will be, licensed by the agency under the 1992 Act.</P>
    <P>The legislation also amends the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, in regard to on-the-stop fines for litter offences. The relevant section provides for an increase of the fine to £100 from a future date to be set by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>We all agree we must promote environmental awareness at every opportunity and in this regard I congratulate the Government on its campaign to promote environmental issues in our schools. Ireland's green schools campaign is going from strength to strength with more than 820 schools registered. The schools participating in the campaign are focusing on the environmental problems created by waste and litter. It is important that similar programmes are developed now and into the future.</P>
    <P>It is important that all local authorities maintain landfill dumps to a high standard of environmental protection. There is a landfill site in my constituency which left a great deal to be desired when it first opened and there was great concern among those living adjacent to it. Some residents living near landfills have suffered adversely in terms of their quality of life and it is incumbent on all local authorities, both morally and legally, to ensure that it is not diminished in any shape or form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government a speedy recovery. I would prefer if he were present and, as a near neighbour, I look forward to him returning to his office as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This so-called waste management Bill is a panic measure which seriously damages local democracy. The amendment of section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, is an absolute disaster. County managers have <Col N="759" /> sought its abolition over the past decade because it is the only power that elected members can invoke. The amendment of the section is the thin edge of the wedge as it has not been completely repealed. For example, Meath County Council was about to invoke section 4(4) in regard to the proposed incinerator but that will not be possible following the enactment of this legislation because the subsection is being deleted.</P>
    <P>The proposal to give county managers the exclusive power to make waste management plans is undemocratic. The Bill removes all power from elected councillors for the making of such plans. This extraordinary, dictatorial measure is designed to facilitate the Minister's agenda to construct five regional incinerators. As the recently published Labour Party strategy on waste management stated, this is the wrong approach. Investment in waste infrastructure should be concentrated on recycling, not incineration, and that is what the Minister's constituents are saying loudly and clearly to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal for a levy on plastic bags is so tentative that it will be inoperable. He proposes to introduce a levy by regulation. The regulations will have a series of conditions and qualifications which will make the scheme unworkable and I base that assertion on my 25 years experience as a county and urban district councillor. It would make more sense if the Minister banned plastic bags altogether. The legislation does not refer to other major sources of litter such as bottles, cans, cartons or to businesses such as chippers, which open late at night and contribute to the pollution of the streets in our towns and cities. The Labour Party will strongly oppose the proposal to remove the decision-making power from elected members of local authorities. We will seek a ban on plastic bags rather than the unworkable levy proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a waste crisis and most people do not realise how serious is it. More than 90% of non-agricultural waste is dumped in landfill sites but the number of dumps is declining. For example, a major dump recently closed in my town. EU regulations will strictly limit the types of waste which can be sent to landfill dumps but, meanwhile, the volume of municipal waste is increasing by 11% per annum. Unless radical action is taken soon householders will wake up some morning, like the people of Ballinasloe did some time ago, to find their refuse still on the streets. This will happen more frequently.</P>
    <P>During the past four years in office the Minister has refused to take responsibility for the crisis or devise a national strategy to address it. He has left it to local and regional authorities who are transfixed by the problem and confronted with local opposition to proposals for both landfill sites and incinerators. Government policy on waste is two-faced. Publicly, the Minister claims to be committed to waste minimisation, reuse and recycling but, privately, he is planning the con<Col N="760" /> struction of five regional incinerators. His approach is leading to a worsening of the problem while opposition to his real plans continues to be mobilised.</P>
    <P>The Minister's failure to act decisively on waste has turned a serious problem into a major crisis. The Labour Party believes there is an alternative strategy. It is not good enough to criticise the Minister for his failure or to oppose his legislation when one is in Opposition. An Opposition party must produce a coherent alternative strategy. The document published by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, is the product of many months of work by the Labour Party analysing the nature of our waste crisis and devising an integrated and sustainable way of minimising and managing waste over the next 25 years. The document shows in practice how to provide an integrated waste management strategy based on the hierarchy of minimisation, reuse, recycling, recovery, treatment and landfill. Every opponent of an incinerator or landfill will respond that their solution is to produce less waste and maximise reuse, recovery and recycling.</P>
    <P>The Government's document, &ldquo;Changing Our Ways&rdquo;, sets a 35% target for recycling. Some regional waste management plans set a higher target of 60% but nobody spelled out a strategy for achieving these targets until the Labour Party published its strategy, which will be successful when implemented. Over the next decade Ireland must move from the Stone Age of waste disposal to high technology waste minimisation, recycling and treatment. A modern, sustainable waste infrastructure must be built here to convert recycling from a nice idea to reality. Recycling plants need to be built to provide separated collection systems and develop markets for recycled materials. All this will cost money but because we are starting almost from scratch we have an opportunity to develop the most modern and sustainable waste infrastructure in the world.</P>
    <P>This means we can skip the waste solutions based on the old style incinerators and move to the next generation of waste management technology which treats waste as a raw material for reconversion and useful products.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will engage in discussions with interested parties on our document which was produced by Deputy Gilmore. We call on the Government to change its disastrous approach to the waste crisis and to adopt a comprehensive policy, as outlined in the Labour Party document. If the Government refuses to change to our approach, we will put this policy before the people at the next general election and commit ourselves to implement it in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bell for sharing his time with me. I also want to convey my best wishes to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I hope he will be back shortly. I am disappointed he is not here as I have a number of hard questions to ask him. This is not a personal issue, <Col N="761" /> but I am one of the Deputies in the eye of the storm as far as waste management is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister will go down in history as the man who set out to enhance local government and then disenfranchised the councillors. He has taken the players off the pitch and allowed the referee to finish the game. This will go down in history as one of the saddest occasions for local democracy in a long time. This legislation is draconian. It does not take any notice of the elected councillors, the local committees or the many different ways to dispose of waste which have been pioneered across the world, but it takes notice of the consultants who, at colossal expense to the Exchequer, draw up plans to dispose of waste through incineration and landfill sites which are placed in areas that families must leave.</P>
      <P>To illustrate this to the House, I will refer to the Connacht waste management plan. The consultants, M.C. O'Sullivan, hatched that plan. It covers the Connacht counties of Galway, Mayo, Roscommon and Leitrim. It suggests that an incinerator should be put in Galway city and it identifies the need for a landfill site in County Galway. Three sites are under observation at present and another one is being considered somewhere in north Connacht. It also refers to reuse, recycling and waste minimisation which is being implemented across the world. However, this plan is riddled with inconsistencies. The other five local authorities did not have a problem agreeing to this plan. Why would they have difficulty doing so, given that their waste is going to County Galway? We will burn their waste and place it in landfill sites. Can one imagine what the councillors in Roscommon and Sligo thought? It was like manna from Heaven for them. We were taking the brunt of the force.</P>
      <P>The landfill site in north Connacht, which M.C. O'Sullivan mentioned, has not been identified three years later because it was not intended to be included. The landfill site in Galway would take all the waste for County Galway. Galway county councillors could not agree to that plan. I am one of the dual mandate brigade which we have heard a lot about in recent weeks. History was made twice in our council when 29 colleagues and I voted unanimously against that plan. The councillors who did that were from every party and none. They came from Clifden and Glenamaddy, which is a distance of 100 miles. Between the 30 of us, we got 50,000 votes at the last election. We decided, on behalf of the communities we represent, this was not the way forward. However, the Government decided it knew better than we did, although many of its members have not stood in Galway. That is what is wrong with this legislation. People are fed up with what the Government is doing on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to say something about incineration. I am not able to evaluate the health risks associated with it, although there are reasons to believe it can be dangerous. The central tenet of this plan was that if an incinerator was built, a waste industry would develop because it must be <Col N="762" /> filled every day with raw product. The only raw product is waste and there is money in waste. Does anyone believe that if an incinerator is built, which costs millions of pounds and involves private business, people will want to minimise the amount of waste? That is not likely to happen. That is where the concept of recycling comes into play. However, the Government has not done anything about recycling. I do not have time to go into details, but I have studied this issue over the past two years and I know more about it now than when I first started.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I acknowledge we have a horrendous problem. Deputy Bell mentioned Ballinasloe in my county. That landfill site will soon reach full capacity, but there is nowhere else to go. I cannot understand that areas in the county have been taken as a county unit. The population of Galway city is increasing more rapidly than the populations of all small cities in Europe. However, it was not allowed to be taken as one unit. It has to carry the waste of Connacht on its back. We know there must be landfill sites. The dump in Kerry, for example, which we visited two or three years ago, is in a Coillte forest. We have approximately 5,000 acres of Coillte forest in south Galway, but it has not been used. M.C. O'Sullivan believes the landfill sites should be situated beside three small communities in Kilrickle, New Inn and Newbridge. These three communities did not get a single shilling from the tiger economy, but they will get a landfill site before this year is over. That is a poor return for their skills and efforts over the years.</P>
    <P>However, there is an alternative. The Minister should allow County Galway and Galway city to act as one unit and he should not build an incinerator. We have place for a landfill site, but we should start recycling our waste. The Minister knows more than our councillors and he believes that councillors should be listened to but not heeded. Some 6,000 people in my home parish of Newbridge voluntarily signed a petition in two weeks. They know what this landfill site will mean in a small area. The county manager in Galway, and I am sure in other counties, does not want that authority because he will have to deal with 30 elected councillors who do not want to adopt the plan.</P>

      <P>It will be very democratic when 30 elected councillors have no say in what happens in regard to our waste management plan. Regardless of how the Deputy twists it, that is the bottom line. Fianna Fáil Deputies are squirming in their offices because they do not know what way to turn.</P>
      <P>I want to turn now to the four horsemen, the four Independents who almost brought down the Government two weeks ago on a local democracy issue, the dual mandate. These are the people who said that local democracy was so important an issue they would bring down the Government. They did not want to bring it down. They wanted to ensure their own well-being. They will have an opportunity at 1.30 p.m. today to go into the lobby and show their sincerity in the way that they do business for the communities they represent. If they believe what they said two weeks ago was right &ndash; apparently they convinced the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government that they were right &ndash; let them stick to that today and stand for local democracy. They should send another signal to the Government, one of the nine or ten currently being sent to it; it will get another on Saturday. This Bill will be seen as the most draconian legislation to go through the House in a long time and I ask everybody who has the slightest idea about local democracy to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill. While I do not intend to go out of my way to welcome the change in managerial powers, I fully appreciate and understand them. For 15 years in my county I acted as chairperson of the waste management committee. It is worth remembering, for those who might have had a similar experience in their counties, that we started off in County Laois some 15 years ago with six landfills throughout the county. Over time, our local authority took the view that one properly managed landfill could meet the needs of the county, if properly controlled, for a 25 year period. Evidence and history have proved that our aspiration of a 25 year period has now been reduced to a 15 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and understand the ministerial thinking behind it. I also understand the reasoning behind the change in managerial power and council responsibilities. It is fair to suggest that councils which properly recognise their responsibilities move to adopt a waste management plan. Unfortunately, those councillors who felt that the fear of the response from the electorate should have a bearing on their attitude towards adopting the plan created the scenario <Col N="764" /> whereby the Minister had no other avenue open to him except to change this particular regulation. I welcome that and understand the reason for it.</P>
    <P>I should make the point that the responsibility is also on the citizens to recognise their responsibility and not just expect public representatives to have responsibility to dispose of waste. The point was made that the role of public representative is to reflect the views of the public, but the public can put forward the view that the Government and the local authority also have a responsibility to dispose of waste. In that regard, if the option of a combination of recycling, reuse and incineration presents itself, as a public representative, I have to accept that we must dispose of that waste.</P>
    <P>Time has moved on in regard to this issue. The issues that were important 20 years ago are somewhat different. Waste management 20 years ago consisted of filling a hole at the nearest location to the biggest town in the county. Water treatment involved running a pipe into the local river or bay, and recycling often meant somebody going around collecting batteries, used tyres, etc. In the past ten years &ndash; I recognise the legitimacy of this &ndash; local environmental groups have been established to protect the environment. The point is often made to public representatives that it is our duty to ensure the protection of the environment for future generations. For that reason I understand the thinking behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>Care of the environment is now paramount. Waste management is becoming an increasingly sophisticated system of reduction, collection, recycling and disposal. Landfill, incineration, composting, COf8&gt;2 emissions and separation are now common parlance. It is a regular theme at community group meetings where the responses from public representatives are often greeted with some dismay because it is seen we are not working quick enough to meet the targets in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the document from the Department, Changing our Ways, which contains specific targets in this area. It is not enough to suggest that the public representative is the only party who has a role to play in this game. We must also encourage the public to become involved by way of reducing and recycling waste and meeting those targets.</P>
    <P>On the issue of managerial power, I understand the reasons for the complaints. A sad aspect of the Bill is that the making of a waste management plan will now become an executive function. The fact remains, however, that a small number of local authorities fail to adopt such plans in a local or regional context and have brought about this situation. Councillors regularly look for more powers, but with additional powers come more responsibilities. Councillors must show that we can also make the difficult decisions. Waste management plans have brought out the worst in people in terms of &ldquo;NIMBYism&rdquo;. Many are against dumping waste but they are not so enthusiastic about reducing and recycling waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> I also recognise the importance of the levy on plastic bags, an initiative I welcome. It is estimated that each person in the State uses 325 bags per annum, allowing for holidays and sick leave. That means we all use one bag per day per person, at a huge cost to the environment. I understand the thinking behind that initiative. Shops offer bags freely without care for the consequences or the effect on the environment, and people accept them. That measure reflects some positive thinking.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments and local authorities have sought to reduce the amount of plastic in circulation, with little effect. The main reason is that plastic is cheap and available, and costs are hidden or negligible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The most criticised element of it is the managerial function area. I do not regard it as draconian. It is a direct response by the Minister to local authorities which, unfortunately, cannot see their way to adopt a plan which, ultimately, is the only way forward to reduce the ever increasing level of waste that confronts each local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most serious problems facing the country is how to deal with the ever growing amount of waste. Our affluent society is producing more rubbish every year and the controversy about waste disposal is high on the political agenda in every community.</P>
      <P>Waste management is a problem we all have to address. Recycling, incineration and landfill prompt hot debate, rumour and myth. We are considering new legislation to deal with the growing mountain of rubbish we all produce and which threatens to tarnish our green image and communities.</P>
      <P>I live one mile from one of the largest landfill sites in the county of Cork and I am well aware of the growing amount of rubbish dumped there every day. Much of that rubbish could be recycled or used in a more constructive way. I commend the Cork County Council workers who are responsible for the management of the dump in Rossmore, Carrigtwohill, which is kept in pristine condition. In a few years, the amount of rubbish has transformed a vast quarry into a small mountain and in the not too distant future, if landfill is the only disposal vehicle for rubbish, the council will be faced again with the problem of finding a new site. Those of us from Cork &ndash; Deputy Bradford will support this &ndash; appreciate the furore that took place in the recent past over where to locate a new landfill site, be it Bottlehill, where it eventually was located, Watergrasshill or Grenagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all recognise the problem with finding landfill sites and everyone agrees with the need to find alternatives. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, identified what must be done when he stated that the proposed <Col N="766" /> plans will first focus on prevention and minimisation, and place great emphasis on waste segregation, reuse and recovery. Our waste recycling rate is among the lowest in the European Union &ndash; up to 90% of our waste goes to landfill. There is almost no biological treatment of waste and no means of recovering energy from it.</P>
      <P>An integrated approach to waste management is imperative if we are to bring about a change to this appalling situation. However, despite the policy statement of October 1999 &ndash; Changing Our Ways &ndash; which outlined the necessity for a regional approach, three out of 15 local authorities have refused to adopt the proposed regional plan. This plan is supported by the majority, but its progress is being held up by a minority.</P>
      <P>It was incumbent on the Government to take action to complete the planning process in the nation's interest. To do so it found it necessary to give powers to county managers to draw up waste management plans which is what the majority wish. Some members of the Opposition complain about what they view as a removal of democracy from local authorities. Twelve out of 15 councils have voted to put in place a waste management plan. The majority voted for this course of action. Does the majority or the minority rule? Fears were expressed that people would not be listened to and that there would be dictators. This will not happen as people are well able to express their views in many courts of appeal if they are not listened to at local level.</P>
      <P>I would prefer that councils make the decisions themselves. However, if they refuse to do so, the Government must take action for the common good. We cannot wait until there is nowhere left to put rubbish before taking action. The Government wanted local authorities to make decisions. They have failed to do so and the Minister had no option but to take action.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear that the Bill's primary objective is not to facilitate incineration, but to allow for the preparation of waste management plans to meet the nation's needs. The plan has a number of aims. First, prevention &ndash; we must do as much as we can to prevent the creation of waste. Second, minimisation &ndash; we must endeavour to keep to a minimum the amount of waste which cannot be prevented. Third, recycling and reuse &ndash; after prevention and minimisation methods have been implemented as much as is possible, our next priority is to divert as much waste as possible to other uses. Fourth, energy recovery &ndash; the next most environmentally sustainable step is to use as much of our remaining waste as possible to produce energy. Fifth, land disposal &ndash; we must ensure any remaining waste can be disposed of in as environmentally friendly a manner as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen from the above that energy recovery and landfill come fourth and fifth, respectively, in the plan. However, there are health and other environmental concerns regarding incineration. It is incumbent on the Govern<Col N="767" /> ment and local authorities to listen to people's concerns and explain the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move to impose a levy on plastic bags. Travelling through the country one can see plastic bags blowing in the wind and caught in bushes. This litter is destroying the countryside and a slap on the wrist will help to reduce such abuse.</P>
    <P>Litter wardens are doing tremendous work. Their activities have cost some people money, but the message is getting through. Tables are published each week in east Cork regarding the cleanliness of villages and towns in the area and the situation has improved immeasurably in recent years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I would prefer if section 4 was not included, but it is necessary due to the inaction of some local authorities. We must put in place an effective and safe waste management structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I am speaking as a member of a local authority which has adopted a waste management plan with the provision that it will be reviewed annually. However, I am also speaking as someone who has lived within five miles of a landfill site for most of my life.</P>
      <P>The debate on waste management at local authority level was one of the most contentious I have witnessed in the council chamber. There is no doubt that we have a serious problem regarding waste and our waste recycling track record is atrocious. We are well behind all other EU countries in this regard and must get serious about dealing with waste. I support the concept of dealing with it on a regional basis. Such an approach is more efficient and regional waste plans need to be adopted.</P>
      <P>The landfill site near which I live has been in operation for 30 years and would not meet many of the controls and regulations set down for new sites. I became a member of a local authority in 1996. However, many environmentally sensitive citizens &ndash; I like to consider myself as one &ndash; who see themselves as greener than me never raised a problem regarding the landfill site near which I live, despite the fact that it was not meeting the controls and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one wants to live near an incinerator or a landfill site, yet we all want a door-to-door refuse collection service. If we want such a service, local authority members must be prepared to take responsibility for dealing with waste. There has been much discussion regarding section 4 of the Bill to which I will return. Some have suggested that county managers may not welcome the idea of having to deal with this problem. County managers do not want to deal with it. They would prefer if the responsibility for dealing with waste rested on the shoulders of local authority members who are accountable to the electorate every five years. When it comes to making tough <Col N="768" /> and difficult decisions, it is handier if those decisions are made by local authority members.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general thrust of the policy on waste management which is grounded in the internationally recognised options of prevention, minimisation, recycling, energy recovery and the environmentally sustainable disposal of waste which cannot be prevented or recovered. It is important that we reduce our reliance on landfill. If we follow the options laid down in the waste management plans, we will have the basis for a sustainable and acceptable system. I welcome the targets in the waste management plan whereby 40% to 60% of our waste will be recycled, incineration will account for between 25% and 45%, and landfill disposal will be in the region of 14% to 20%. I also welcome the door-to-door waste collection service in urban areas which is both desirable and important. We must focus seriously on the recycling issue. While most of the debate on waste management seems to be centering on incineration, it represents only step four in the waste management plan. We must place a greater emphasis on other areas, such as recycling, minimisation and prevention in order to deal effectively with waste before we consider incineration.</P>
    <P>There is an element of fear of the unknown when we talk about incinerators. I do not consider myself an expert in that area so I tend to draw upon the expertise of others. There is so much misinformation that the public can, understandably, become cautious. I listened to some Members of the Opposition comment on how they feel when councillors rejected waste management plans. They said that is undemocratic.</P>
    <P>As regards section 4, local authority members should have as much power as possible. Most local authorities, however, accept the waste plan and we will have to deal with the problem unless some other viable option is brought forward. I have not heard of such an alternative, however. We cannot hold up progress on a matter as serious as waste management just because a number of local authorities have refused to deal with it and do not have any viable alternative. Because of that, I must reluctantly conclude that section 4 appears to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on other sections, if time permitted. As an EU member state, Ireland is not in compliance with its obligations under EU waste directives. We must become serious and bite the bullet on waste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation interests me greatly, not least because my parish is due to receive the proposed new super dump for County Cork. Obviously, therefore, waste management is a subject which has occupied my mind and my time to a great degree in recent months. The Bill is a major error and the decision to remove <Col N="769" /> responsibility and power from elected local authority members is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government a speedy recovery from his illness. I do not like making personal attacks on Ministers. However, he took charge of his portfolio four years ago with a large list of promises. He indicated that he would be a good Minister and there were high expectations but, unfortunately, he has failed across a broad range of issues for which he has responsibility, and none more so than in waste management.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about waste management on so many occasions and at so many conferences that a collection of his speeches on this subject would create a volume of waste. He has not delivered, however. What is being proposed in the main component of the Bill is basically passing the buck.</P>
      <P>Currently, 90% of waste is disposed of by landfill. The concepts of reduction, re-use and recycling should be at the core of any waste legislation but at the core of this Bill is the undemocratic decision to remove power and responsibility from elected councillors. I know how difficult it is to be involved in the local government decision-making process when a landfill site or similar waste disposal facility is being placed on your doorstep. We are in politics to make difficult decisions as well as popular ones. The least we should expect at national level from the Minister and the Government is leadership but we are not getting any direction concerning waste management.</P>
      <P>I concede that the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, is doing excellent work to combat litter but I am amazed that in the budget and the Finance Bill no provision was made to encourage recycling. No tax breaks were introduced to encourage reduction, re-use or recycling of waste. Hopefully, those matters will be examined now. We know that recycling is not commercial at present. In the vast majority of towns and villages there are no recycling facilities. Surely we should encourage the recycling, reduction and re-use of waste by all possible methods, including tax breaks. If we can give people tax incentives for residential and commercial properties, we can surely do the same to deal with the waste management crisis.</P>
      <P>I do not suffer from the NIMBY syndrome. I am as prepared to accept tough decisions as the next person but I want to see better leadership from the Government on the waste management issue. All we have heard from the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, since he assumed office in July 1997 is talk, and talk is proving to be cheap. The waste mountains have increased and if this Bill is the Minister's answer it is a pathetic response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's inability to deal with waste management is his greatest failure. No Minister is in a better position to deal with the problem than the current holder of the office. The public is now tuned into the crisis in waste disposal. Ten years ago, politicians trying to impress upon their con<Col N="770" /> stituents the need for the recycling, reduction and re-use of waste would have been sneered at. We would have been seen as presenting a minority viewpoint. However, every citizen is now fully aware that there is a waste management crisis. Any Government presenting reasonable, structured proposals to deal with the problem would find such measures were fully supported by the public. However, the only proposal in this Bill is to hand over the final decision-making powers to county managers, which is not a serious proposition. It will cause serious problems rather than solving waste management issues.</P>
    <P>A 15p tax on plastic bags and levies on landfill will play a small part but until we can provide each household with a system of waste separation to encourage recycling and waste reduction, we will continue to create mountains of waste rather than deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish I had more time but I accept that my two colleagues want to contribute to the debate. I put on the record my disappointment at the Minister's failure to deal with this subject. I am not trying to make political capital out of this failure but the record speaks for itself. I hope the next Government will do a better job and that the next Minister will deal with the problem rather than pass the buck as the current Minister has done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá faoin mBille tábhachtach seo atá os comhair an Tí i láthair na huaire. It is generally agreed that we have a major problem with waste management. The country is swamped with a mountain of waste which completely contradicts our belief that we are a green and clean island that attracts tourists by the million and produces green food. This is no more than empty rhetoric.</P>
      <P>Like all Members of the House, I often meet visitors to our shores. They enjoy the scenery, the warm welcome, hospitality and friendliness of the people. The only negative comments one is likely to hear are about the litter-strewn streets, roads, fields and beaches. How often do we read of such comments in the letters pages of our newspapers when visitors return home stating that they had an enjoyable time in Ireland but that we should clean up our countryside?</P>
      <P>Last summer, I spent a number of days in Scotland, a country not unlike our own. As the Chair well knows we have similar terrain and scenery. The lasting impression I have is of the absence of litter, the cleanliness of the streets and countryside. If they can do it surely it should not be impossible for us. We can learn much from our visitors, particularly those from Europe, to our country. When they vacate their holiday homes or chalets they leave very little waste behind, usually one bag with glass, another containing papers and perhaps a third containing cans. This is how they segregate their waste in their own homes. We need to educate our young people to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> The fact that the Minister has had to introduce such a Bill indicates what a massive job we have to do. We passed the Waste Management Act, 1996, but after five years in operation it is obvious that it has not solved our waste management problems. It is very difficult to change habits that have become ingrained over the years. The process of change must commence in our schools with our young people.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, this process has already started and we see in provincial newspapers the excellent work carried out by schools in different parts of the country in keeping their own areas litter free. These initiatives must be intensified and supported. There are also voluntary committees and tidy towns committees doing excellent work in this area. Last Saturday morning as I drove along the M50 there were several groups of men collecting debris along that route. I asked myself how did that route become so littered? The obvious answer is that the litter was discarded by passing vehicles. Our attitudes to litter are highly irresponsible.</P>
    <P>While it is plainly obvious that something has to be done I do not think this Bill will solve the problem. The central aims of the Bill are threefold. It aims to remove the powers from local authority elected representatives and pass it to the executive, provide for the introduction of an environmental levy on plastic shopping bags and on the landfill of waste, and establish an environmental fund.</P>
    <P>The proposal to transfer responsibility to executives of local authorities goes to the very heart and core of local democracy. It is an attack on the primacy of the elected representative. Does the Minister seriously believe that by doing this the problem can be solved overnight? We have already handed over responsibility for Traveller resettlement but the success has been extremely limited. Surely in the aftermath of the Nice referendum the Government should understand that it cannot ride roughshod over the wishes of the people. Fine Gael has produced a waste management plan advocating a national waste management authority. This authority would implement a national programme of recycling in conjunction with local authorities and would be fully accountable to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The second proposal in this Bill advocates the introduction of a levy on plastic bags. It is estimated that the cost of a plastic bag to a supermarket is about half a penny. A levy of 15p per bag would have a major impact on their use. There is general agreement that there is a proliferation of discarded bags throughout the countryside and that something must be done. It may be wise to differentiate between different types of such bags. There is the high density bag that we get at every supermarket checkout which is usually discarded as soon as one goes home with the groceries. However, there is another type of plastic bag known as the low density patch handle carrier bag, a high quality bag used mainly by depart<Col N="772" /> ment stores and boutiques. The patch handle bag offers strength and high quality printing and consequently they are often re-used several times. In the consultancy study on plastic bags commissioned by the Department of the Environment and Local Government prepared by Fehily, Timoney &amp; Company the annual consumption of plastic bags in Ireland is estimated at 1.26 billion, an astronomical number. The low density patch handle carrier bags represent only between 5% to 6% of overall market volume. The majority of these low density quality bags in Ireland are manufactured by Earraí Pacála Idirnáisiúnta Teoranta at Gaoth Dobhair in the Donegal Gaeltacht where some 30 people are employed. The proposed tax would be devastating for this industry and its workers. Perhaps the Minister would consider equal treatment for low density patch handle carrier bags and paper bags. Paper bags, as outlined in the Fehily Timoney &amp; Company report, are even less environmentally friendly than low density plastic bags. The Minister should carefully evaluate the proposal to have both types treated equally. I ask the Minister and the officials to consider this proposal sympathetically.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> This Bill is an outrageous attack on local democracy. It constitutes a very serious perversion of local democracy arising from the Government's disastrous failure on waste management. Less than 10% of waste in the State is dealt with by re-use or recycling programmes. This inevitably puts huge pressure on landfills and, naturally, local communities voice opposition to burgeoning landfill sites. The only answer the Government has offered is to set aside a crucial aspect of local democracy and introduce the monster of incineration.</P>
      <P>This Government has not lifted a finger to have an effective reduction of waste at source or to introduce meaningful and comprehensive programmes of re-use and recycling. Packaging to excess seems to be the norm in the State. When one goes into a supermarket every couple of sausages or cut of black pudding has a foam tray under it and plastic wrapping around it. All this ends up as waste which is sent to landfill dumps. This is because the Government is not prepared to stand up to the commercial interests that wrap produce in excessive packaging for the sake of their sales and profits. The Government will not stand up to the vested interests who fund the major political parties through political donations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction waste constitutes a large part of waste which goes to landfill. Much of it could be recycled into materials useful for road building, etc. There are no meaningful attempts to force this to happen. The Minister is as much a failure in this area as he is with water conservation. A <Col N="773" /> few changes to planning laws and construction by-laws to modify new and existing homes could result in saving billions of gallons of treated water annually.</P>
    <P>While they may use fancy names such as thermal treatment, the only solution the Government has is incineration. That is disastrous and is not a solution to the problem. It destroys valuable resources that can be recycled. It will take on a life of its own when the undoubtedly privatised companies that will be given a franchise should this Bill be passed need more and more waste in order to make their business profitable. It is an incentive to increase the amount of waste rather than reduce it, not to mention the effects on health.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to smash an important aspect of local democracy. It gives dictatorial powers to county managers in a most incredible way. It means giving power to consultants, like MC O'Sullivan Limited and the rest of them. They are the people who will now decide on waste management programmes rather than elected representatives. It is pathetic to see Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Independents being whipped in here to support this measure. They will rue this day. The sheep may go through the lobby today but they will face formidable and justifiable opposition from local communities on the question of incineration in particular. Communities will mobilise and through peaceful civil disobedience they will stop many of these things. I encourage them to do so because this is a disastrous route to take. We should instead be travelling the road of comprehensive programmes of reduction, reuse and recycling.</P>
    <P>The taxation of plastic bags is an unimaginative proposal. If an extraterrestrial were to arrive here they would think plastic bags were part of our eco-system. On every bush and briar along every road, by-road and bóithrín there are strips of multi-coloured plastic bags flying permanently and with impunity. The State should set aside the tricolour and adopt the plastic bag as its national flag. There would be no need to run it up the poles on St. Patrick's Day and other days of renown as it would be flying permanently all over the country. We should have effective measures to reduce this scourge. I am not convinced that the tax the Minister suggests is the most effective action. It is inequitable. It will not create a major problem for those with cars but it will for others. We should have a programme to change from plastic to paper bags, where that is appropriate, and to more durable materials that can be used and reused. I agree with encouraging us to use durable bags when shopping to avoid this particular cause of major littering.</P>

      <P>I am very glad of this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001. As the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has said to us via the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, the principal objective of this Bill is to allow completion of the waste management planning process. There is a very serious crisis in waste management. I compliment the Minister of State on what he has done to combat littering. There is a great awareness among young people, through our education system, that litter has to be tackled. I was very impressed last Tuesday morning, listening to the enforcement officer with Sligo County Council, Ms Aideen Feeney, speaking about her job. She tries to deal with people who dump litter throughout Sligo county and she has a very difficult job getting the evidence. She has to find the people and prosecute them. Dumping is a serious rural issue. Ms Feeney told us that she takes her wellingtons and gloves and goes around at the weekends. Now the local authority has given her a mobile phone she is more effective in catching those who are guilty of dumping. It is a 24 hour job for people like Ms Feeney and I pay tribute to her and to enforcement officers in every local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad the Minister brought in the environmental levy on plastic shopping bags which is very welcome and long overdue. This levy and the environmental fund, to be funded from the revenues from the new levies, are the two most welcome aspects of the legislation. There is much emphasis on the fact that we are now making and adopting a waste management plan which will become a management function of the local authority. There has been criticism of that. Equally the Bill refers to a reserve function whereby, in specified circumstances, the variation or replacement of a waste management plan will be dealt with by the members. One of my concerns regards the way in which regional waste management plans have come about. While many Deputies have welcomed the regional strategy, I can see instances where a county strategy would be better. For example, Galway, the second largest county, is part of a regional plan and there is concern that the refuse of five counties will end up in one of three landfill sites in east Galway, the constituency I represent. The great mystery is the reference in the Connacht waste management plan to two landfill sites. There will be a site in east Galway but there is no reference as to where the second landfill site will be. Presumably it will be in north Connacht. The three landfill sites in east Galway were selected by consultants and there was no opportunity for public consultation in the process. In the past I strongly recommended that an advertisement be placed in the local papers to establish if a suitable landfill site could be provided and in that way there would be community involvement. Local councillors in Galway County Council have identified a site but <Col N="775" /> we are told it cannot be investigated until a decision is made on the other three sites. Will the Minister tell us where the second landfill site under the Connacht waste management plan is to be located?</P>
    <P>Questions arise in this Bill concerning the powers of the county manager. We spoke recently on the Local Government Bill, 2000, and many Deputies referred to the excessive powers of county managers. One Deputy referred to the manager as a tin god and many felt that managers had too much power. I will not go into that debate but one of the arguments advanced in support of directly elected cathaoirligh and mayors was that they would be able to stand up to county managers. When you have five committees or groups in County Galway concerned with waste management their concerns must be taken seriously. The small, rural communities in Newbridge, New Inn and Kilrikle in addition to the Clontuskert group near Ballinasloe and the Ballinasloe superdump committee have expressed strong reservations about landfill or thermal treatment sites being placed near them. The Minister mentioned the Ballinasloe landfill site and described it as unique and problematic that the only available landfill site is operated by Ballinasloe urban district council. This landfill is quickly filling up and at current intake levels will reach its authorised capacity next year. There are regional plans involving a number of counties such as the Connacht plan.</P>
    <P>There are regional plans for the midlands, the north-east and the south-west. In addition, there are county plans for Carlow, Donegal, Kilkenny, Kildare, Wicklow, Waterford, Tipperary South Riding, Wexford and a Cork city and county plan. I mention those plans because a case could have been made for a county and city plan for Galway, it being the second largest county after Cork. It is a reasonable request. The county manager should be allowed to consider sites in Galway other than the three outlined in the plan. Perhaps the Minister could investigate whether there is some legal reason the manager cannot investigate other sites.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that we use landfills for approximately 90% of our municipal waste, which is often put in small, inadequate landfills. Our waste recycling rate is among the lowest in the EU, while building and demolition waste is still going into landfills at a time when we have huge investment in roads. The Galway-Ballinasloe section of the new road from Galway to Dublin is costed at £300 million, while the cost of the whole road is £1 billion. Obviously some of the building and demolition waste should be used for that development or in other developments around the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the minority of local authorities where no waste management plans have been adopted and that is a fair point. Galway County Council has rejected the Connacht <Col N="776" /> plan twice by 30 votes to zero. However, many local authorities have tried to adopt a plan on the basis of there being no thermal treatment or landfill disposal in their counties. This is happening in Connacht though I presume the Minister has rejected these plans. It is very easy to adopt a plan when there are so many qualifications that it will not work. Everyone says in the plans that they want recycling plants and the Connacht plan proposes 21 such centres in the region. One feature of the regional plans is the concentration on recycling. The Connacht plan proposes 48% recycling, while the Dublin figure is 59%. It makes sense to concentrate on recycling.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that public representatives should be helping local communities through providing water and sewerage schemes in villages. I know the Minister is making progress on that and I thank him for initiatives he has taken. I mentioned Newbridge, which is one area where a water supply has been sanctioned. It is also interesting that when I recently attended the opening of an extension to a primary school near Kilrickle, the parish priest said they could not open a school earlier because there was no water supply. We must concentrate on getting water and sewerage schemes to smaller towns and villages. The people in the third site I mentioned in east Galway, New Inn, are concerned there will be a motorway through the area as well as a superdump, given the huge road development in the county which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The most positive aspect of the waste management plans is the interest students are taking in the environment. Recently I attended the celebration of an award to Creggs national school on the Galway-Roscommon border. It was awarded a European green flag and the principal, Mattie McDonagh, raised many green flags when he played for Galway. I compliment him and his staff on that great achievement. Not only does the school have a litter campaign, it has a composting project and takes away empty detergent bottles and hazardous waste, which is brought out of the region. Another encouraging sign is the appearance of bottle banks in every town and village. There are also centres for the collection of newspapers and clothes banks, which are welcome developments. We have also seen the introduction in our larger towns of two or three bin system where people can separate their waste, which is welcome. We hope that leads to a situation similar to that in other European cities, where there is multiple collection of waste, though it raises the question of higher costs for these types of services.</P>
    <P>Regarding bottle banks, great credit is due to Galway Rehab for starting bottle banks in Galway in conjunction with the local authority. Poorer areas are often very interested in bottle banks and recycling, while farmers are also interested in protecting the environment; their participation in the rural environmental protection scheme is one example of that.</P>
    <P>We have a number of regional waste management plans and individual county plans. The county plans may possibly work better, though it <Col N="777" /> is not the Minister's fault that these strategies were adopted; they were adopted in the past. However, Galway had a number of dumps and landfill sites &ndash; up to 15 in the past &ndash; which were gradually closed down until we were left with one in Ballinasloe. We see a major change where we are going from one per county to one or two for a region and the Ballinasloe landfill is due to close by 2005. The idea that one can impose a landfill site on a small community is fundamentally wrong. One cannot have a landfill site where there are schools or where people live. These sites should be provided in isolated areas, away from schools and communities. Many local authority members have pointed out where these sites are available.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the European Commission has taken a case against Ireland on the basis that we are not in compliance with our obligations under the EU waste directives. If the European Court finds against us, a timetable for full compliance will be imposed, as might a substantial levy. I know the Minister is very concerned about that. I congratulate him on much of the work he is doing, particularly with water and sewerage schemes but there are other questions on which he should provide answers, such as the powers of county managers and county plans as distinct from regional plans. I wish the Minister a speedy recovery from his illness and hope he can respond to some of the issues I have raised.</P>

      <P>I will address two aspects of the Bill, one of which is the removal of power from elected representatives. I appreciate the problems the Minister had and the fact that in the four years he has been in power very little has happened regarding the waste issue. We have failed to meet our commitments to Europe but that is not the only issue. The Bill proposes giving county managers full power, which is extremely serious.</P>
      <P>Last week we saw the extraordinary powers of the Independent Members here and the emergency meeting of Fianna Fáil backbenchers regarding the dual mandate, remuneration of councillors and so on. We are supposed to have electoral reform and local government reform to make sure that local government has more power, but here again we see those powers being removed. There will be nobody at county level answerable to the electorate. County councillors must go before the people every five years now and Deputies may have to go any day now, so we are answerable to the people. Area plans were drawn up in Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath and will now obviously be decided by the county managers rather than the councils concerned, if the Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> Major change is needed. There needs to be further education on this issue and, while I welcome the commitment in the Bill towards education &ndash; the Minister saw the efforts of the local authority in Ardaghy last week to educate young people on the need for waste management and tidiness &ndash; this will not be the answer to it.</P>
    <P>The proposal to impose a £15 per tonne charge will cost the people of County Monaghan close to £600,000. This means that the increase put off last year will be forced by the Minister's actions. However, it will not be the people of County Monaghan who will have the right to spend that money, but the Minister. Last year, the Minister for Finance imposed a new levy on cigarettes. The funds raised were supposed to be spent on health promotion but have disappeared into the overall kitty.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem relating to agri-waste in County Monaghan. There has been much talk about incineration. Agri-waste is classified within the European Union as biomass. There is mushroom compost waste, poultry waste and other waste, all of which is doing enormous damage to the environment. If we are to increase production to allow farmers and the industry to stay in business, we must deal with this problem. There is a proposal that has been passed by Brussels. We want a commitment from the Minister to ensure that proposal is successful in order that power and heat can be produced in an economic fashion. The proposal will proceed to planning stage in the next few weeks and I urge the Minister to take this issue seriously and provide the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not in the House. I wish him well and know that all Members wish to see him back, perhaps on the Opposition benches, but to full health and strength.</P>

      <P>I hope not too soon. To come forward a little in time, in 1999 the Government asked the electorate to endorse an amendment which for the first time placed local government in the Constitution. The amendment was duly endorsed in this jurisdiction on the same day that local elections were held. Article 28(a) of that amendment states that the State recognises the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law, and in promoting by its initiative the interests of such communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view and that of my party, Sinn Féin, the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2000, makes a mockery of that constitutional <Col N="779" /> amendment which the Government regarded at the time as the jewel in the crown of its reform and proposed reform of local government. Last week, the Local Government Bill, 2000, passed Committee Stage. It was and is inadequate regardless of any amendments that may be made on Report Stage. It was gutted when one of the few real reforms in the Bill, the ending of the dual mandate, was removed.</P>
    <P>The Bill was to usher in a new era for local government but it does nothing of the sort. There is no empowerment and no enhancement of local democracy. The harsh reality of the Government's attitude to local democracy is contained in this Bill, the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2000. Some local authorities did not follow the wishes of the Minister of the Environment and Local Government &ndash; I join Deputy Crawford in sending my good wishes to the Minister regardless of what I am saying and thank the Deputy for sharing his time &ndash; and, because they did not accept the Minister's <i>diktat</i>, powers with regard to waste management are now to be taken away from elected members of local authorities and placed in the hands of the unelected city and county managers. On the day this Bill was published, the Government's commitment to local democracy was exposed as a complete sham.</P>
    <P>The regionalisation of waste management planning has also been exposed as an elaborate hoax designed to fool the people and their public representatives into believing this is a democratic process. In the north east region, which includes my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, the Sinn Féin councillors on Monaghan County Council succeeded in having adopted a series of amendments to the waste management plan. These include the following measures: a requirement that household waste collection be carried out in both rural and urban areas; a definite target for waste reduction by industry to be met within the lifetime of the plan; and support for innovative schemes to recycle agricultural waste.</P>
    <P>We soon found that, in the supposed regional model of planning adopted by the Government, there was no provision for such amendments to be made. Each local authority was expected to simply rubber-stamp the regional plan. Colleagues in my group voted against the plan because of the inclusion of incineration but regrettably it was passed on the collective vote of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members &ndash; a pattern sadly repeated throughout the State, although not in all cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure all waste management plans are made as soon as possible. The waste management planning process has been under way, in some cases, for over four years now. We need to move quickly to implementation of the plans to free up <Col N="780" /> the delivery of a modern waste management infrastructure and improved services. Our waste arising continues to grow at a conservatively estimated rate of 3% to 4% each year. At the same time, there is an increasing scarcity of disposal options as landfill facilities throughout the country are closed as they reach the end of their lifespan. The Government is facing up to its responsibilities in bringing forward this legislation which allows us to move forward with implementation of the waste plans.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clune, Deputy Gilmore and others suggested that these proposals are an attack on local democracy. I do not accept this. The Government proposes to make the least number of possible changes necessary to bring the current planning waste management process to a satisfactory conclusion. The proposed changes will have effect only in respect of the small number of local authorities; those who have so far failed to make a waste management plan, or those who have purported to make a plan but whose decisions would be invalid because of qualifications imposed. It is also logical and necessary to ensure the implementation of the plans cannot be obstructed during the planning and development process, and the Bill provides for this.</P>
      <P>The subsequent variation or replacement of a waste management plan remains a reserved function, and will in the first instance revert wholly to the elected members after four years, allowing them to review their plans as required every five years. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has worked continually in the past three years to drive forward a major programme of local renewal, including the current Local Government Bill, 2000. I share his belief that local democracy is as strong as ever. However, the role of the modern local council must be one of leadership. Sometimes, it is necessary to look beyond the horizons of the parish and make decisions for the benefit of the broader community. Similarly, the Minister, with ultimate responsibility, must take the tough decision to ensure there are no further delays in the provision of a modern waste management infrastructure. This is essential if we are to meet our national and EU commitments in relation to waste management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism was made of a perceived lack of recycling, lack of funding and the absence of segregated collection services which are commonplace elsewhere. However, ongoing delays in making and implementing these plans are holding up the delivery of recycling services, the development of recycling infrastructure and the investment advocated by Deputies on all sides of the House. We have proposed integrated waste management services for the regions which will deliver a much higher recycling performance, recovering energy from waste which cannot be recycled and using landfill as a last resort for residual waste which cannot otherwise be recovered. One cannot segregate and recycle all waste. There will always be residual waste, which <Col N="781" /> must either be thermally treated or landfilled, and no amount of aspiration or pursuit of &ldquo;zero waste&rdquo; strategies will change this reality.</P>
    <P>Incineration and high recycling levels are not incompatible. The regional plans give priority to achieving the highest recycling targets, typically between 40% and 50%. Only then do they give consideration to thermal treatment and landfill of the remaining waste. Under these plans, the capacity of the proposed thermal treatment facilities is deliberately limited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to the Canberra zero waste policy and objectives. This policy is an aspiration and it has not been achieved. While Canberra succeeded in year one in diverting construction waste from landfill, which is relatively easy, the authorities have not succeeded in the same way in relation to municipal and domestic waste. Landfill of these wastes continues at more or less the same level as when the zero waste initiative began.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald suggested there is nothing in the Bill about recycling. This misses the point. The objective is to bring the waste planning process to a conclusion. Waste plans contain ambitious targets for waste recycling and recovery. That is why we must move forward as quickly as possible to implement those plans.</P>
    <P>Deputies Deasy and Cosgrave raised the issue of funding for recycling infrastructure. Exchequer and EU funding worth £100 million is available to implement these aspects of the plans to give direct support to the development of the requisite recycling and composting infrastructure. The Minister will ask local authorities, in regional groups, to prioritise the elements of the plans which deal with the delivery of segregated collection services and waste recycling infrastructure. A clear programme of action to bring these aspects forward as soon as possible must be prepared.</P>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House identified the need for greater environmental awareness and education. This need is recognised under waste management plans. Many local authorities have already taken positive steps in this direction with the appointment of full-time environmental</P>
    <P>awareness officers to promote more sustainable action at local level.</P>
    <P>Many Members' contributions centred on possible environmental and health concerns relating to thermal treatment. The EPA, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions, considers that municipal waste incineration, operating to the best modern standards and incorporating energy recovery, is preferable to landfill from an environmental viewpoint. The technology as well as the licensing and control arrangements have been substantially improved in recent years. The strict control regime which is provided for in the recently adopted European Council directive on the Incineration of Waste has been largely anticipated under the licensing system operated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA may not grant a licence unless it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not <Col N="782" /> endanger human health or harm the environment. In addition to licensing, such facilities are also subject to development control under the planning system which provides a formal procedure for public input into the decision making process.</P>
    <P>The European Commission estimates that the implementation of the new directive will result in a 99% reduction in emissions of dioxins from waste incineration, relative to 1993-95. In addition, the Commission expects the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to overall emissions of dioxins in Europe would be reduced to 0.3%, assuming the output of other sources remains unchanged. This is an indication of the significant improvements that have been made in emission control technologies, compared with older generations of waste incinerators.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke raised the issue of the management of incinerator ash. This is relatively a straightforward process. Most incinerator ash is officially classified by the EU as a non-hazardous waste &ndash; metals can be extracted from it and the remaining material can be either used in, for example, road construction or it can be quite safely disposed of in an ordinary landfill. Fly ash amounts to about 5% of the waste incinerated and is a hazardous waste, which would be landfilled in an appropriate purpose-built hazardous waste facility. This is standard practice throughout the EU. This waste could also be solidified so as to immobilise any hazardous constituents before landfill.</P>
    <P>Thermal treatment plays a significant part in the safe disposal of waste in many European countries including Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, which are generally acknowledged as having enlightened and progressive environmental policies. Even where recycling is maximised, other methods of waste disposal are still necessary. For example, in Denmark in 1999, 64% of waste was recycled, 24% was incinerated and 12% was deposited in landfill. Approximately 60% of Danish dwellings obtain their heating and hot water from district heating plants &ndash; many of which are waste-to-energy plants. A significant environmental advantage of thermal treatment, in this context, is that the recovery of energy by generation of electricity results in the replacement of fossil fuels with the consequent benefit of a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. I am satisfied that emissions from any proposed new thermal treatment facilities employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards should not have any appreciable negative environmental impact locally or nationally.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and the Labour Party published policy documents recently which recognise that thermal treatment or other new technologies have a role to play. The Green Party's counterparts elsewhere in Europe also recognise this. It is time for all sides here to face up to their responsibilities. If there is a credible alternative to the Govern<Col N="783" /> ment's strategy, why has it not been put forward by one of the other political parties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that the Government's waste management strategy sets out an ambitious but realistic agenda for turning a situation of almost exclusive reliance on landfill into one where landfill is a last resort. It is an integrated strategy which respects the internationally recognised hierarchy of prevention, minimisation, reuse-recycle energy recovery and safe disposal. It sets ambitious rates for reuse-recycling and recognises the role of stringently controlled incineration with energy recovery, which is widely used elsewhere in Europe and further afield. There is no credible alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is pleased that there will be a statutory basis for further important waste management and anti-litter measures, including a new environmental levy of up to 15p on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags and potentially the extension of the levy to other problematic waste products. Deputies Haughey, Clune, Belton and Perry raised some questions on how the environment levy might operate in practice. The primary purpose of the proposed measure is to directly influence consumer behaviour to achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of plastic shopping bags at retail outlets. The levy is being targeted primarily at those bags dis<Col N="784" /> pensed at point of sale in retail outlets rather than small in-store bags such as those used at fruit and vegetable counters. The detailed modalities relating to the implementation, collection and enforcement of the proposed levy will be addressed in regulations in consultations with the Revenue Commissioners and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister also intends to introduce a levy, at an initial rate of not more than £15 per tonne, on disposal of waste into landfill. A new environmental fund will be established through which the proceeds of these levies will be disbursed to finance beneficial environment initiatives in a range of areas including waste management and environmental education and awareness. The Bill also provides for an increase in the on-the-spot litter fine to £100, for future changes in the level of the fine and for technical amendments to the Waste Management Act, 1996, to bring legal clarity to licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency of certain waste activities.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill will provide a legal mechanism to satisfactorily conclude the stalled waste management process and to facilitate the delivery of improved waste services and the development of an effective and safe waste infrastructure. It will also provide for a range of environmentally important and desirable initiatives to be undertaken in the near future. Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Quest>when the agency to support women with crisis pregnancies will be established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution concerning crisis pregnancies are among the matters being considered by the Cabinet committee, of which I am Chairman. Although, in principle, the Government is committed to an approach along the lines set out in the all-party committee report, considerable preparatory work needs to be undertaken before a plan can be put in place.</P>
      <P>Work is under way in my Department on appropriate arrangements for the establishment of an agency along the lines proposed by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It is envisaged that the agency will be established by means of a statutory instrument under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961. A draft statutory instrument is being prepared by my Department and is being examined by the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>It will be the task of the agency, when established, to prepare and implement a national plan to prevent crisis pregnancies. As I indicated to the House on 22 May, I am willing to have a debate on the establishment of this agency when further work has been undertaken in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the number of women who leave the State to have abortions. I would like the figures to be determined independently. I do not know if they are higher or lower than the claimed figures. We know, however, that there is a significant number each year. The objective of funding an agency to help women with crisis pregnancies is to reduce the number and assist people who do not want an abortion but have one because they feel they have no other course of action.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that nothing should receive greater priority than this issue, which is one of life and death? Why is it taking so long? The constitutional committee made its report some months ago and the recommendation for an expenditure of £50 million on a pro-life agency has been pressed by Fine Gael for a considerable period. When will we see the agency and the money? Does the Minister share my concern that the agency should be in operation at the earliest possible date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Mitchell's concern. While we are going through the legal processes and preparatory work to establish the agency, other work is still ongoing in terms of the funding of many non-governmental counselling agencies providing counselling to many women with crisis pregnancies. Not all such women wish to have an abortion. Therefore, the services of the agency will have to be quite comprehensive. In that context, we increased the funding for the development of services over the past three years. Also, we have initiated a major public awareness campaign, Think Twice, the function of which is to change people's behaviour. It is a long-term project as one does not change behaviour patterns overnight.</P>
      <P>I anticipate the statutory instrument and the establishment of the agency itself in the autumn.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, may I take it from recent press reports that progress has been made on the wording for the pro-life referendum which is being proposed to accompany this agency? I detect, both within this House and outside, that the voices of those in favour of abortion or choice are not heard as they should be. The Government has, of its own volition, promised a referendum in this regard. When will it take place?</P>

      <P>The inter-departmental committee, of which I am Chairman, has made some progress on both issues. They are interlinked. Any measures that emerge from the deliberations of the inter-departmental committee will have to address the establishment of an agency to deal with crisis pregnancies. It would be preferable if this were to occur in conjunction with a referendum. The progress of the inter-departmental committee will be considered by the Cabinet.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the arrangements he has made to resolve the dispute with the Irish Medical Organisation regarding the provision of medical cards for the over-70s; the method of payment that is planned in respect of these patients; the guarantees he can give to patients over 70 who qualify for the scheme that it will begin on schedule; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19194/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of the medical card scheme to give automatic eligibility to persons aged 70 and over was announced in the budget and it is a well-established practice that such announcements do not involve prior consultation with parties which, in other circumstances, would be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> Negotiations have taken place with the Irish Medical Organisation with a view to resolving this issue and, while some progress was made, these negotiations concluded early this morning without achieving a resolution.</P>
    <P>While regrettable, I wish to make it clear that the Government is prepared, within reasonable limits, to concede significant increases in capitation payments to GPs in respect of persons aged 70 and over who avail of the new scheme, and efforts will continue to be made to resolve the issue. However, the Government regards the current demands of the Irish Medical Organisation concerning their participation in the new scheme as excessive in the context of the additional work involved, but efforts will continue to resolve the issue. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage on the detail of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I intend to sign the commencement order that will give effect to the Government's decision, subsequently given legislative effect by the Oireachtas. I feel obliged to do this because of the other benefits that accrue to holders of a medical card. Contingency arrangements have been made with health boards to issue medical cards. I hope it will be possible to reach an early resolution with the Irish Medical Organisation on outstanding matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Government has a disastrous record regarding this matter, which was announced in the budget without any preparation? It did not declare until very late that legislative change would be required. It had to do a U-turn in that regard.</P>
      <P>More importantly, ever since this measure was announced in the budget, the Minister for Health and Children has been on a collision course with doctors. Within days of the measure supposedly being ready for implementation he is unable to tell the House that it will be provided. He will agree that is extremely disappointing and disturbing for those patients over 70 years who were expecting the Government to honour its word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not think it revealing that he has travelled the country preaching that partnership is the way forward for the health service, given that, in this instance, there was a total absence of partnership? The measure was announced without any consultation or regard for its implications. He is now reaping a whirlwind of discontent among doctors because of his sledgehammer approach. Given that he is determined to sign the order, will the Minister comment on the fact that the IMO is talking about rolling industrial action? Surely he sees that this is a serious matter, especially given that other issues that have not been addressed are now being brought into negotiations. The Minister is presenting a red rag to a bull. Rather than ensuring this measure was dealt with early on, he has engaged in brinkmanship. Such methods are not good for the health service, especially the relationship between patients and doctors. Does <Col N="789" /> the Minster agree that this ill thought out and opportunistic measure, brought forward to try to earn brownie points for Fianna Fáil, has blown up in his face? It has led to great anxiety and worry among patients who expected they would have the security of a medical card as a matter of course on 1 July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my surprise at the Deputy's consistently strong defence of the profession involved in this matter. The line of attack from the Labour Party has been on the side of the professionals, as opposed to older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy when she made a series of points via a question. Budgets are made by Governments elected by the people, they are not negotiated. There was no negotiation before decisions were made in the past, such as extending free travel to over 65s or introducing free secondary education. Governments elected by the people are entitled to make fundamental decisions on eligibility. Irrespective of who is in power, I defend the right of Governments to make decisions on which no organisation should have a veto. This matter is of interest to all Members, some of whom have more expensive plans regarding the extension of the medical card and access to GP cover. As the matters under negotiation will have significant implications for the proposals of other parties, Members should take a reflective stance.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are a two-way process and only last April a significant deal in relation to practice nurses and secretaries, asylum seekers, discretionary medical cards and equipment grants was concluded with the IMO, amounting to about £10 million. There was another major agreement last year concerning significantly increased rates of immunisation. It would be wrong to say that the Government has been adversarial with the IMO, as its track record shows it has been particularly generous. While discussions are ongoing, I am hopeful as significant offers have been made.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the report on bed capacity review to the Eastern Regional Health Authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19448/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by the Government in the PPF. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly. I will bring the findings of the <Col N="790" /> study to Government with a view to agreeing the overall strategy for the health services.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the national review of bed capacity, the Eastern Regional Health Authority prepared a comprehensive needs assessment indicating a requirement for 1,276 additional acute beds by 2011 to meet increasing demands. The objective of the ERHA assessment was to determine whether additional acute beds are required within the eastern region based on good standards of efficiency, population characteristics and medical health care developments.</P>
      <P>My Department also invited the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to submit proposals on measures which could be put in place in the short-term to bring additional bed capacity into the acute hospital system. In this regard the ERHA recently submitted proposals to my Department aimed at increasing bed capacity within the eastern region. The proposals identify potential to increase the acute hospital bed complement in the region by 325 beds and ten extra day care places up to 2003.</P>
      <P>I have allocated additional revenue funding of £3 million to the ERHA to support the initiatives proposed. This funding is being utilised by the ERHA to fund the early commissioning of 53 additional beds and support a number of initiatives aimed at alleviating pressure on accident and emergency departments and improving patient services. I am satisfied that this investment will allow for the enhancement of acute hospital services in the eastern region. The additional proposals identified by the ERHA are being examined by my Department and will be considered in the context of funding available and other competing demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the eastern region accounts for 41% of acute beds and 41% of all activity nationally? Is he ashamed to learn from the ERHA bed capacity review that there has been a decrease of 31% in acute beds in the eastern region since 1980? The number of acute beds in the region has gone from 7,066 to 4,884, or 4,076 when obstetrics and psychiatry beds are excluded. When bed supply per thousand people in the eastern region is adjusted to account for the 20% of patients treated in ERHA hospitals who are from other health board areas, the ratio of beds is lower than both the ratio in the United Kingdom and the OECD average. Why do certain hospitals, such as those dealing with gynaecology, orthopaedics, ophthalmology or ear, nose and throat conditions, have relatively low occupancy rates, even though the specialties concerned have a high demand and long waiting lists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the report states that long waiting lists and waiting times for elective admissions are adversely affected by down theatre time? The report mentions a recent ERHA survey that showed that about 22% of theatre time is unavailable, equivalent to one week per month. The main reason given for lost theatre <Col N="791" /> time is a shortage of trained theatre nurses. How can that be allowed to happen in a country that has 60,000 registered nurses, even if only half of them are in the hospital system? The Minister is entering his fifth year in government. How can he account for the figures I have cited?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes about three years to train a nurse. On the Order of Business some time ago, Deputy Quinn acknowledged that the rainbow Government did not listen to representations made at the time regarding increases in the number of training places in nursing schools. We are reaping the whirlwind as a result of the lack of foresight shown. Nursing unions lobbied for a cap on nurse training places in the early 1990s. Since the Government came to office, it has dramatically increased the number of training places in nursing schools. There are 1,340 places in such schools this year, an increase on last year's record intake. It will take some time for the nurses to come through, as training courses last three years. A range of measures have been introduced in the interim, not least overseas recruitment. About 4,500 nurses came in to the system last year and when resignations and retirements are taken into account, there was an increase of 1,300 nurses, a significant achievement by any objective standard. The Government has introduced a range of incentives for nurses to take specialist courses, especially in theatre nursing. Fees and salaries will be paid while the courses are being undertaken. Flexitime was introduced last November to improve job retention within the profession, following consultation with the Nursing Alliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>MRSA is a significant infection which occurs in hospitals and the community. It is a major issue for health care systems in all countries. There are many contributing factors, including the use of antibiotics and the control of infection in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>MRSA is part of the broader issue of anti-microbial resistance which is being addressed in a number of ways. Guidelines for acute hospitals and other facilities in relation to the control of MRSA were developed and circulated to health boards and other relevant parties in 1995. In 1999 a North-South study of MRSA prevalence was undertaken, under the direction of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. This was a follow-up to a previous study carried out in 1995. This study provided much useful data and also made a range of recommendations for the control of MRSA. This included identification of a wide range of issues which needed to be addressed at hospital level. The guidelines issued in 1995 suggest a variety of options for nursing patients with MRSA but did not state single rooms were essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999 my Department also asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre to evaluate the problem of anti-microbial resistance in Ireland and formulate a strategy for the future. <Col N="793" /> The NDSC has given detailed consideration to these issues and drawn up a strategy for the control of anti-microbial resistance in Ireland, SARI, which I launched on 19 June last. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issues, including those referred to by the Deputy. These can be grouped into the following four categories: surveillance of resistance and antibiotic use; hygiene and prevention of infection; judicious use of antibiotics in hospitals and the community; and education of health care workers, patients and the general public.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendations in this report and I am committed to ensuring their implementation. Tackling the problem of anti-microbial resistance is a multi-faceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. As a first step, in the current year £2 million has been provided for the health boards for anti-microbial resistance measures, taking into account the recommendations in SARI and the North-South study of MRSA in Ireland 1999.</P>
    <P>The boards have been asked to address, in particular, infection control strategies and staffing in both hospitals and the community, the development of surveillance systems for the collection of anti-microbial resistance data and information on antibiotic prescribing in hospitals. In addition, funding has been provided for the establishment of an MRSA reference laboratory at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, which, it is envisaged, will come into operation later this year.</P>

      <P>The strategy to which I alluded was prepared under the aegis of the NDSC and will be the key driving force behind our policy on MRSA in hospitals. We are taking the issue seriously and it will be addressed in a comprehensive and strategic way. Major structural investment is being made in hospitals throughout the State in terms of the equipment that will be used and this will improve conditions. Major projects have been sanctioned for hospitals in Dublin, including the Mater Hospital, Temple Street Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital and St. James's Hospital. For example, significant investment has been made in the leukaemia bone marrow unit in St. James's Hospital to provide more modern, separate facilities to prevent the spread of all forms of infection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The area of children's rights is complex. Both historically and constitutionally the family has been the unit of society which received special protection and children's rights have been taken into account within this unit. The Constitution Review Group in its report, published in 1996, made a number of recommendations in this area. The all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution is considering the report of the Constitution Review Group and the committee has been requested, on behalf of the Government, to prioritise its consideration of the issue of the constitutional underpinning of individual children's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, there have been substantial developments in the area of strengthening children's rights in Ireland in recent years. One of the most significant developments was the launch last year of the Government's national children's strategy to further progress the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The goals and objectives of the strategy support the implementation of children's rights. One of the objectives in the strategy specifically refers to children being supported to enjoy opti<Col N="795" /> mum physical, mental and emotional well-being and specifically targets children's waiting lists for services, including waiting times for ENT, cardiac and orthodontic procedures.</P>
    <P>Under the strategy, it is proposed to establish an ombudsman for children as an independent office. The necessary legislation is being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope to bring it before the House during the next session. The ombudsman will be a powerful, independent advocate for children. There have also been important legislative developments in Ireland, which strengthen and protect children's rights in key areas. The most notable have been the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Child Care Act, 1991, the Children Act, 1997, and the Children Bill, 1999, which was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made to date in implementing the national children's strategy. Funding of £2 million has been allocated in 2001 to commence the establishment of the new infrastructure necessary to implement the strategy. The National Children's Office has been established on an administrative basis. The second meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on children is due to take place next month. The priorities of the children's office have already been agreed by the sub-committee and they are the implementation of the Children Bill, 1999, and the development of a national play and recreation policy. The National Children's Advisory Council has been established and among its membership are children. The council is working in the areas of the voice of children and play and recreation.</P>
    <P>A special session of the United Nations General Assembly will be held from 19-21 September 2001 for follow-up to the World Summit for Children which took place in 1990. A comprehensive end of decade report for Ireland has been prepared by the National Children's Office and a draft submitted to UNICEF.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the Department of Health and Children is developing a new health strategy to provide for improved health status and the development, reform and modernisation of the health and personal social services in the next five to seven years. The new strategy is planned for completion in the next few months and will comprehensively deal with all aspects of the health service, including waiting lists for children and adults. In the light of the above and pending the outcome of the all-party Oireachtas committee's deliberations, I have no plans to introduce a charter of children's rights at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the appointment of an ombudsman for children and various European legislation but made no reference to the problems facing children in the State. Is it right that children must wait for four years for orthodontic treatment in my health board <Col N="796" /> area or one year for a simple procedure such as the removal of a tooth under anaesthetic? We say we cherish children under the Constitution, yet a mother of a 13 year old child who suffered from cancer had to come to my clinic recently to see if I could get a bed for the child in St. Luke's Hospital. What can I tell that mother and others parents who are waiting for beds for their children? The children are upset and they do not want to go to school. I want to know what the Minister of State, who has responsibility for children, will do within the health boards to resolve these problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that each Department and Minister retains responsibility for the items set out in the national children's strategy. However, he will be interested to know that between March 2000 and March 2001 the number of children awaiting cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by 78%. The number waiting for general surgery for more than six months decreased by 16% and the number of children waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 50%.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 29%. The Minister, Deputy Martin, will deal with orthodontics later. The Deputy will also be aware that £5 million has been allocated this year for the treatment of orthodontic services. The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no child waits longer than six months for treatment. I hope that will be the result of the new health strategy when it is established by the Department and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider putting a specialised person in every health board to deal with children's problems, whether it is orthodontics, cardiac or other procedures, rather than allowing parents to worry about waiting lists and to beg people to get treatment? That is a reasonable request.</P>

      <Quest>if he will guarantee that all health service development projects included in the national development plan will go ahead in the period 2000 to 2006.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital programme for the health services under the national development plan represents a major initiative by the Government to radically improve the infrastructure of our service. My Department has overall strategic responsibility for the national development plan to develop the health service infrastructure in a co-ordinated and effective manner. However, the prioritisation and delivery of individual capital projects at local level is primarily a matter for the health boards.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 billion was provided at the launch of the plan for the health service nationally for the period 2000 to 2006. As 2000 was the first year of the national development plan for the health services, transitional arrangements applied in relation to capital funding for health boards to ensure existing commitments were met while allowing scope for various new approvals throughout the country. As regards 2001 to 2006, capital funding was indicated to health boards for each of those years for various care programmes, such as disability services, child care, acute hospitals, etc. The actual funding available each year to individual health boards will depend on a number of factors, including adjustments in respect of various issues, such as inflation, changing service priorities, technological developments, new clinical practices, progress on the delivery of specific projects and market capacity in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Health boards have developed plans under the national development plan for the years 2001 to 2006 in line with the indicative funding levels notified to them by my Department at the commencement of the plan. The health board plans are expected to evolve over the period of the plan in line with prevailing service, financial and operational circumstances. It is, therefore, not possible at this stage to project the progress on individual projects proposed under the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the 15% inflationary figure attached to each development in the plan? Given that 100 developments are planned for the north-west, is he satisfied that the programme management has the capability to deliver the plan? Is he satisfied with the significant gap which exists between the allocation of funding and the development plan adopted by the health board, particularly in relation to the strategy for the elderly which has not yet been put in place? I am concerned that the information and communication technology plan, particularly in <Col N="798" /> terms of general practitioner and hospital technology, is not in place. The strategy for the elderly should be in place at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to know if we can guarantee that every project will go ahead. In the context of the reply I gave, we cannot guarantee that in every health board area because there is a range of planning issues, etc. Inflation, particularly over the lifetime of the plan, is causing me and health boards concern. It was significant in 2000. The St. Vincent's Hospital project, for example, was significantly above the original estimate. Admittedly, we included £25 million extra for theatre modernisation, namely, new theatres. Apart from that, however, there was still a significant increase in the estimate. That matter will be under continuous review. We will examine the entire capital projections in the context of the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept it is not sufficient to say he has worries and concerns? It is clear that miscalculations have been made in terms of costs. We all need to know if the Minister is talking about the deferral or the scrapping of projects. The Minister may be aware that a senior civil servant in the Department has already been quoted as saying that hard decisions may have to be made. Is it time the Minister came clean about the fact that the cost estimates for the capital projects he was planning under this plan are wrong? He needs to indicate now what he intends to do and where he will make changes or cutbacks to the capital programme. People depend on these projects and it is important they are not led up the garden path in terms of what can be achieved within the timeframe of the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>Is the Minister aware of an article written in the<i> Irish Medical Times</i> on 22 June this year which states that by 2002 it appears increasingly unlikely that the £2 billion allocated to health projects will be anywhere near enough to meet the costs and that when one factors in the amount other projects will cost under the national development plan, health boards will have to put strong cases to ensure the health service does not come second to the Bertie bowl or Luas?

      <P>It will be difficult to answer all those questions in one minute. We are reviewing the capital requirements in the context of the health strategy. The national development plan represented a trebling of the resources provided in the previous seven years. It is the first major capital investment in health by any Government almost since the foundation of the health service. That should be acknowledged in the House. Major projects are now under way as a result of that, such as St. Vincent's Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Galway University Hospital and other hospitals throughout the country, such as that in Portlaoise.</P>

      <P>Huge projects are taking place which were not even dreamed of two or three years ago. That is the reality.</P>

    <P>The other issue is that other health boards have come forward with other projects, notwithstanding their own prioritisation within the national development plan. Many Members of this House have also come forward with projects they want considered. Even in the interim period, we provided for projects that were not included in the national development plan. Demands are now being made on us in terms of interim projects while we are waiting for some of the major projects to be built, which will invariably take time. <Col N="800" /> There is not an accident and emergency department in the country which is not planned for refurbishment and modernisation but, unfortunately, because of the design, planning, tendering, etc. process, it could take three or four years before many of them are built.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past number of years the health promotion unit of my Department has <Col N="801" /> contributed towards the funding of Dublin healthy cities project and will continue to do so in the future. The relevant local authorities and the health boards also fund the Dublin healthy cities project. The project was an initiative of the World Health Organisation's European office and was established in 1989. Its aims are to promote a co-ordinated approach to improving the physical, social and mental well-being of city dwellers by a partnership of local government, statutory and voluntary sectors with active involvement of citizens in decisions affecting their health.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any recently published statistics relating to a prevalence of acute illness on the north side of the city. In line with the commitments of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Deputy will be aware that the national anti-poverty strategy and the health working group was set up in 2000 to identify potential health targets relating to inequalities and social exclusion, and associated outcomes. The health working group is scheduled to submit a report of its findings to my Department within a month. This report will be of benefit to both policy makers and service providers in the identification and development of services appropriate to the needs of communities at both local and regional level. It will be a valuable tool in assisting ongoing research and providing a firm basis for future research.</P>
      <P>Following on from this process, a steering committee, to be set up by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, will examine all working group reports and identify gaps or cross-cutting issues. A national seminar will then take place allowing for an open discussion on the steering committee's report, and a proposal will be put to Government.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not want to delay on this point except to say that my understanding is that some work has been done in terms of assessing, on an area basis in the north side of Dublin, the extent of illness and early levels of mortality under the healthy cities project. Apart from the work that has been done in terms of the strategy, does the Minister believe it is important now to assess and research fully the impact of poverty on health? Having done the comparative study, North and South, where the information indicates that up to 6,000 people would not die if there were special targeted measures to address their needs as a result of the impact of poverty on their health, rather than waiting on the anti-poverty strategy to report, or indeed his own health strategy, does the Minister agree there should be an ongoing, regional plan based on research?</P>

      <P>To be fair to the chief medical officer, in his 1999 report which was published in 2000, he concentrated heavily on the issue of inequalities in health and the impact of socio-economic conditions on the health status of <Col N="802" /> people. The most recent research commissioned by the Institute of Public Health draws significant conclusions on socio-economic status and health. That will continue to be a significant focus of our activities in terms of the allocation of resources. That is one of the reasons we concentrated much of our public investment in public hospitals. It is also the reason we agreed, in the national development plan, to split the funding and provide £1 billion for community infrastructure and £1 billion for hospital infrastructure. One of the issues affecting areas of socio-economic deprivation is the lack of sufficient infrastructure on the ground in terms of community and day centre facilities and multi-disciplinary clinics where people can avail of services. The emphasis must switch to areas like that. The partnership areas, drug task forces, etc. have been significant, but their emphasis to date has been on economic-education issues. The health dimension never featured to the same degree as those other issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The heads and general scheme of a Public Health and Tobacco Bill, as approved by the Government on the 27 February 2001, were forwarded by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government on 2 March for completion of drafting. I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill soon. I cannot say at this time when the Bill will be enacted as that will depend on the parliamentary process, but it is my hope that, with cross-party support, it will be enacted without any undue delay in the autumn session.</P>
      <P>The Bill will introduce a range of measures to further the recommendations contained in the report, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, launched with Government approval last year. Tobacco use, and in particular cigarette smoking, remains the leading cause of preventable illness. Tobacco is a significant burden on individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. Our success in improving the health status of the nation is linked to further reducing the level of smoking and, particularly, in preventing young people from starting to smoke. We must ensure that today's children will not be the future victims of the tobacco industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Bill will provide, among other measures, for a ban on sales of packets of cigarettes of less than 20, the ending of in-store advertising of tobacco products, stronger powers of enforcement for officials implementing the law in this area, the registration of premises selling tobacco products, a requirement by the tobacco industry to provide detailed information on the composition of tobacco products and the estab<Col N="803" /> lishment of the office of tobacco control on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Public health success in reducing tobacco use requires activity on all fronts. When we have these additional legislative measures in place, and with the additional resources being made available for health promotion activities, research and enforcement activities, I believe there will be a reduction in smoking levels. The Bill is a clear indication of the Government's intention that a new and determined response is being mounted against smoking with the ultimate aim of a tobacco free society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The sweet cigarettes proved an embarrassment for me on one occasion in a particular shop, but we will talk about that some other time. The legislation will be ready in a few weeks. I did not say it would be the autumn before it is ready. I expect it will be published within the next three to four weeks. What I meant was that the Dáil is going into recess next week and it will be the autumn session before we have a chance to debate it in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill has not been frequently announced. We published the heads of the Bill and at the time we were anxious to keep the momentum going in terms of the tobacco debate, which is important, and to keep people fully aware of the measures we intend to take. We <Col N="804" /> have passed three Acts in this session. I agree with the Deputy in terms of the need for a legislative unit within the Department. There is no such unit, but we are working on this issue. Such units can do much preparatory work in terms of giving effect to legislation. The Health (Amendment) Act increased the age limit for smoking to 18 years and also increased the fines.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of evidence recently given to the sub-committee on health and smoking to the effect that over 50% of patients admitted to, for example, St. James's Hospital are admitted because of smoking or smoking related illnesses such as hardening of the arteries, cancer or whatever? This is an extraordinary figure. I will be careful in choosing my words as I do not wish to prejudice the sub-committee's inquiry. However, would the Minister join me in calling on the three tobacco companies invited to appear before the sub-committee to take up the invitation and not to put the sub-committee to the test regarding compellability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly endorse the Deputy's comments regarding tobacco companies. It is unacceptable that they would not take up the invitation of an Oireachtas committee. I find that repugnant and it flies in the face of democracy and the fact that the sub-committee comprises elected representatives who are pursuing an issue which is important in terms of public health. The same companies look for dialogue and consultation, yet they are not prepared to meet the Oireachtas committee on an important issue.</P>

      <Quest>the number of children who have received orthodontic treatment in the past four years; the number on waiting lists who have not received treatment; when those patients now on the waiting lists will receive treatment, if at all; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that between 1998 and the end of the March quarter 2001, a total of 6,880 patients had their orthodontic treatment completed. This total excludes figures for 1998 and 1999 for the North Eastern and North Western Health Boards. The chief executive officer of the North Western Health Board has informed me that the number of completed treatments in 2000 is also not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, this total excludes the number of completed treatments in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board which are developing their computerised patient management systems. However, the chief execu<Col N="805" /> tive officer of the ERHA has informed me that 1,436 patients were discharged from the authority's waiting lists since June 2000.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, North Western, South Eastern and Western Health Boards have further informed me that a total of 9,615 patients between their boards were receiving orthodontic treatment at the end of the March quarter 2001. There are 31,743 people awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment at the end of this quarter.</P>
    <P>I recognise that waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed and the recruitment of a fourth consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is in train. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and the recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed; two of the managers will commence duty in July and the third will take up duty next August. A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is being equipped. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed. The Northern Area Health Board is progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. Agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics and four dentists will commence training in 2001. Validation of waiting lists is in progress. The initiative in the ERHA will enable an additional <Col N="806" /> 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting lists to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board's proposals include the development of new orthodontic units in Tralee and north Cork and the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists &ndash; both positions were advertised last week. The board also proposes to commission four additional orthodontic chairs in the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital and validate waiting lists. These proposals will double the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce waiting times to under 12 months in the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The proposals from the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, North Western, South Eastern and Western Health Boards include the use of private orthodontists, the training of two specialists in orthodontics in the Dublin Dental Hospital to commence in October 2001, and the recruitment of three additional orthodontic specialists, one senior clinical dental surgeon, four dental surgery assistants and three administrative staff. Additional sessions by health board staff and validation of waiting lists are also proposed. The impact of the initiative in these health boards will enable an additional 2,500 patients approximately to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>Overall, this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists. The health boards have advised me that the ultimate effect of their proposals when fully implemented, will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. The outcome of this initiative in conjunction with the structural changes will be carefully monitored to assess the impact on waiting lists and determine what further resources, if any, are required. It is not possible to put a timescale on this.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister appalled by these extraordinary waiting list figures? There are 31,000 children on waiting lists. Given the length of the waiting lists and the likelihood of other patients joining them, what is the possibility of providing treatment for the majority of these children while at school? What advice can the Minister offer children on these waiting lists, some of whom are waiting eight years? What advice has he to offer them by way of remedy?</P>

      <P>As a result of additional investment this year in the ERHA area, two additional consultants have been appointed and a fourth consultant orthodontist is being recruited. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and the process for recruiting three managers for the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed. Many other measures have been put in place as a result of this year's investment. The ERHA hopes these measures will result in the commencement of treatment for an additional 3,000 patients currently on assessment waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> The Southern Health Board is the other area in which there are long waiting lists. The board has been involved in the development of two new orthodontic units in Tralee and north Cork and advertisements were placed last week for the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists. The board's proposals will double the capacity of the orthodontic service in the area and reduce waiting times to under 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have also received proposals from the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, North Western, South Eastern and Western Health Boards to include the use of private orthodontists. The boards are happy that if they can secure the additional capacity, they will reduce waiting lists.</P>

If these people have a medical card, they should be refunded directly. If they do not have a medical card, they should be given an allowance.

      <P>The extension of the medical card scheme to give automatic eligibility to persons aged 70 and over was announced in the budget and legislative effect was subsequently given to this decision by the Oireachtas in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to an earlier Priority Question, negotiations have taken place with the Irish Medical Organisation with a view to resolving this issue and, while some progress was made, these negotiations concluded earlier this morning without achieving a resolution. Efforts will continue to be made to resolve the issue and against this background it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage on the detail of the negotiations. In addition, an agreement must be concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and discussions with this organisation are in hand.</P>
      <P>I propose to sign the commencement order under the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to commence the relevant provision entitling those aged 70 and over to automatic eligibility for a medical card because of the other benefits which will accrue to them, and contingency arrangements have been made with health boards to issue medical cards. It will then be a matter for the IMO and for individual general practitioners to decide their position but I wish to make clear that the Government remains committed to this important social policy development. When those negotiations are successfully completed, I would expect all general practitioners to co-operate with all aspects of the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not ashamed and annoyed by the fact that this measure was announced last December but has not yet been put into effect? It was heralded as a major breakthrough and since then it has been clearly indicated that doctors are not happy with the way in which the matter was handled. Is the Minister aware of the fact that today in County Monaghan, an old age pensioner applied for a medical card, in his own right, but the doctor refused to sign it? This man is entitled to a medical card irrespective of whether he is over 70 years of age. Because he is over 70, however, and is classified under the new arrangement the Minister introduced last December, he has been refused the right even to have his application considered. This is a very serious matter and the facts speak for themselves.</P>

I would be happier if I were in a position to announce a resolution to the issues that have been raised. Those issues are fundamentally about the level of payments to general practitioners. We have made a significant offer on that front and both parties are in contact with each other. I am hopeful that we can resolve the matter but, if not, contingency plans are in place.</P>

The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was resubmitted on Committee Stage to facilitate a technical amendment, but why did the Minister do that? As these medical cards are to be made available under the law of the land, will the Minister confirm that if he signs the order and general practitioners refuse to provide the service, those over 70 will have the right to sue? Who can they sue?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree the real problem is that he has tinkered with the system and, as a result, a single person on £101 per week does not qualify for a medical card?

      <P>The amendment I tabled to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was agreed unanimously by the House, was done strictly on legal advice. The advice was that if we did not insert that measure, in future the State or the Government of the day could potentially be vulnerable to a legal challenge over the provision of services under the GMS to people aged over 70.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty about an overall review of reform. Our forthcoming health strategy will provide a particular perspective on the basis of that reform.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that this is a problem solely of the Government's <Col N="811" /> making? Had the Government chosen, for example, to increase income limits for medical cards, doctors would not have had a leg to stand on. In terms of this decision, however, which went as far as requiring legislative changes, the Minister is now open to a range of grievances from general practitioners, some of which go back years. The Minister is in a very awkward position since he made the running on this provision and is unable to deliver on it by 1 July. Surely the Minister is aware that he had contractual obligations with the general practitioners? It was both foolish and misleading of the Government to make this announcement without regard to those obligations. The Minister should take the initiative to get out of this mess by re-negotiating the contract with general practitioners. This would ensure that we have a fair and free system of general practice care which doctors can deliver on the basis of being compensated. That is not to say that we are taking the professionals' side. We have argued for, and the Minister has preached about, partnership but this example is the complete opposite of partnership. It is sledge-hammer negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>One can approach the extension of eligibility under the GMS in a number of ways. One can do so on grounds of basic income eligibility, which crosses all age groups but makes no reference to medical need which is often a critical factor in the need to have a medical card. A healthy 35-year-old, irrespective of income, may not need a medical card as much as a 74-year-old person, due to obvious circumstances. Many demands have been made in this House that people with specific diseases or medical conditions should get medical cards automatically.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister let me know if the £6,000 income, which may be obtained under the rent-a-room scheme, is taken into consideration for qualification for medical cards? When it was announced in the budget the Minister for Finance said it would not interfere with welfare funding. I have already tabled this question and the reply I was given was that it would be referred to health boards. To the best of my knowledge the health boards have not yet established if income from the scheme will be allowable for inclusion. If the Minister does not have an answer today, he can let me know at a later time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>If general practitioners agreed to a settlement with the Minister on this issue tomorrow morning, there is another problem lying in wait. The problem is with the preparedness of the health boards &ndash; certainly the Western Health Board &ndash; in processing the applications which will arise. The Western Health Board is issuing the over-70s who have inquired about the matter with the standard application form. They are not prepared to issue anything else until the Minister sanctions the scheme. There will be further delay and further concerns among those aged over 70 years if this continues indefinitely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will follow up the matter. He has generally committed himself, in the context of many budgetary changes or increases in social <Col N="813" /> welfare, that changes will not affect people's entitlements.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Burke's proposition, I have already said that it would be preferable if agreement could have been reached earlier. The Government is committed to this. It is not a huge measure. The matter has been over-heated and the response excessive. At most, it will affect between 33,000 and 40,000 additional people, an average of 23 per general practice. There may be other issues in the background, but what is happening is not justified. In saying that, we have prepared contingency plans to make sure, as from 1 July, people will have an entitlement to what the medical card bestows upon them. There will be new forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 18 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>No formal decisions were taken at the Government meeting held in Ballymascanlon. The purpose of the meeting was to present an overview of the health services, which encompassed the historical background, the current status and projections into the future. The meeting also provided an opportunity for the Government to be updated on progress in developing the new health strategy. In this context, the costs of possible options in developing health services were outlined at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is working intensively on the preparation of the new health strategy. The overall approach to the strategy is being guided by a steering group comprising top management of the Department and chief executive officers of health boards. In addition, a project team with an experienced departmental and health board membership is responsible for co-ordinating the work and preparing a draft of the strategy. As I have previously outlined to the House, a participative approach is being adopted to the develop<Col N="814" /> ment of the strategy. This includes an extensive consultation process with the public and all key stakeholders. The national consultative forum is meeting again on 10 and 11 July. Detailed drafting will then be finalised as quickly as possible and I will submit it to Government for approval before publication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously expect the House to take him seriously in his fifth year in office, when, after little more than an eight week dash, he presents this Fianna Fáil election manifesto dressed up as a health strategy? Does he agree that it is more like a Hans Christian Andersen publication than anything that this House should be expected to take seriously? Why did the Government not publish its health strategy four years ago? In its fifth year in office it is now publishing its health strategy while the Opposition has long since published proposals for it. Why has the Minister waited until the fifth year in government, on the verge of an election, to present to the public what he purports to be a health strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an election manifesto. It is a health strategy drawn up after the widest consultation ever entered into in the field. That consultation has been with the general public, all those who work in the service and all other stakeholders. We have involved many different groups which have an interest in the development of our health services. The strategy will reflect their perspectives and inputs. In that respect, it will be a significant strategy based on a significant consultative process.</P>
      <P>The first health strategy was published in 1994. It was put together by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government with Deputy Howlin as Minister for Health and Children. It is timely to look at the perpetration of a new strategy as seven years have now elapsed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to publish a strategy every time we change Government. God knows, we change Governments a lot in this country. Until the formation of the Government the average lifespan of a Government was three and a half years. We should have enough maturity in this House to have consistency in the application of policies where a strategy developed by all the interested parties is concerned. Since 1997 we have worked with the 1994 strategy and built on it in terms of the huge investment in capacity.</P>

      <P>The Minister has no strategy. I want brief answers to three questions. Clearly the <Col N="815" /> timeframe for implementation, set by the Minister, of July is now gone. Will he clarify what the deadlines for completing the health strategy are? Has there been any improvement in the disagreement between the Minister and the Minister for Finance over funding? Have they worked any way towards dealing with this? It has huge implications for the strategy.</P>
      <P>I asked that the Joint Committee on Health and Children be briefed by departmental civil servants in the way the Cabinet was in County Louth. The Minister said that he would consider my request. Will he, please, state that it is possible for the committee to receive this briefing? It represents all parties and we are entitled to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies refer to a matter first raised in an article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>. As a result of that report, I have asked my Department to carry out an investigation and preliminary inquiries indicate that the National Drugs Advisory Board, the Eastern Health Board and my Department were <Col N="817" /> not aware of the information contained in it. The suggestion is that one of the lots used in the preparation of the vaccine administered as part of the vaccination programme in 1973 may have contained the animal vaccine, Tribovax T. My Department was not made aware of any such allegation prior to today's newspaper report. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is making inquiries as to whether this issue has been raised previously but senior staff working in its public health department are not aware of it. The company mentioned in today's report has also been asked to furnish me with the result of its investigations into this matter. I have stressed that I would like this information as a matter of urgency and asked the Irish Medicines Board, formerly the National Drugs Advisory Board, to investigate. In view of the implications for standards of good manufacturing practice, should the allegations be proved correct, I have asked that the board liaise with the UK Medicines Control Agency in the conduct of its investigation. I will await the result of these inquiries before considering if further investigation is necessary. I will make the results of these investigations known to the House as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I stress this issue is not related to the current immunisation programme and take the opportunity to reassure parents, health professionals and the general public about the safety of current vaccines. All expert advice available to me in my Department indicates that the vaccines in use in the primary child immunisation programme are very safe and highly effective in preventing infectious diseases in individuals and the community generally. It is important to note that vaccines are subject to rigorous testing before being licensed and ongoing monitoring when in use. Immunisation has proven to be a safe and effective measure in combating infectious disease in children and the community and played a major part in the reduction of childhood death and illness from infectious disease. The primary child immunisation programme will continue to be an essential element of our health service and I urge all parents to have their children immunised. That will ensure individual children and the population generally will have maximum protection from the diseases concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the fact that the suspect lot of Tribovax T was administered as part of the drug trial now being investigated by the Laffoy commission and that the reactions to all the vaccinations in this trial were returned to Wellcome, is it not probable that Wellcome knew this vaccine was destined for animals rather than humans? Can the Minister assure the House that neither the Eastern Health Board nor the Department of Health and Children was informed by the Wellcome Foundation, as it was then known, that the vaccine was destined for animals? Were the parents of the child concerned informed and, if not, is the Department researching and collating the data with a view to <Col N="818" /> contacting the individual involved? Were the batches in question withdrawn?</P>
      <P>The human and veterinary vaccines were not recorded separately, they were recorded on one list. Does the Minister agree that the fact they were recorded at the same time, in the same log book and against general manufacturing practice, gives rise to huge concern?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply refers to the fact that this vaccine might have been administered as part of the vaccination programme in 1973. The Deputy said it was part of a clinical trial in 1973, the one described in the chief medical officer's report on vaccine trials in institutions, industrial schools and orphanages. It is not immediately clear whether it was either one, or a subsequent vaccine trial. The <i>Irish Independent</i> referred to the possibility of there being additional vaccine trials, aside from those covered, which may have been in a community setting. It is too unclear at this point to narrow down exactly the circumstances and context in which this vaccine was administered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have referred any trial undertaken in an industrial school or orphanage to the Laffoy commission. Let us be clear that was in relation to vaccine trials <i>per se</i>, and the fact that vaccine trials were conducted on children in orphanages where the issue was abuse and assault. The wider issue covered for some time in this House and elsewhere was the general one of Trivax, its potency and the quality of particular batches administered during the 1970s. The use of an animal vaccine in a clinical trial, or other context in Dublin in 1973, is a new element broached in the pages of the <i>Irish Independent </i>this morning. We have initiated preliminary investigations to elicit preliminary answers and on receipt of those answers we will be in a better position to plan ahead or make decisions as to where we go from here. I give an undertaking to return to the House next week regarding updates on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it was acceptable to use Irish children as guinea pigs in this experiment in order that multinational pharmaceutical companies, such as Wellcome, could make even greater profits? It is frightening and obscene. It is all the more frightening that such a basic error could have been made and that the children concerned could have been vaccinated with an animal vaccine. Where will the buck stop? Will the Minister ensure people are called to account? Will he ensure Wellcome is called to account? Are we to continue contracts with this company, having discovered it made such an error? Will the Minister assure the House he will do everything he can on this? I will raise this at the Committee on Health and Children asking <Col N="819" /> that we can conduct an inquiry into this using powers of compellability, as it is a scandal. Will the Minister ensure that everyone in his Department, the health authorities and Wellcome is thoroughly investigated in a preliminary investigation he will carry out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am shocked that this could happen and on a previous occasion, in relation to a similar related matter, I stated in the House that children should never be used as guinea pigs in any trial, particularly without the consent of guardians or parents. I am as shocked by this morning's revelations as Deputy Gormley and am equally concerned that we get fast answers from those concerned. If we do not get answers we will have to consider the options we then have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister is not in a position to answer all the questions but it is important to get clarity in as far as we can. Since this is such a serious matter, has he yet worked out how he is to properly follow up an investigation into children who were not in industrial schools or other institutions being used for clinical trials? It appears here that trials were carried out on children who attended health board clinics. Does the Minister envisage that being the subject of some form of inquiry in the way that those institutions are now subject to an inquiry?</P>
      <P>I also seek clarification as to the role of the health boards. Have they no records of what happened here? When Wellcome was contacted about clinical trials being carried out on children in care, was there no indication from Wellcome of experimental work it had done on children in Ireland other than those in care? Were questions raised by the Department in that regard that were left unanswered? Reference is made to one baby who showed serious signs of the effects of the wrong administration of drugs used for animals. Are we clear that there was only one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of adverse reactions as reported in today's newspaper, with one case where the reactions were very serious. The health board concerned, or its successor, has not uncovered anything yet in relation to information relayed to it by Wellcome at the time. Its view is that Wellcome did not make anyone aware at the time of the fact that this vaccine was used in a clinical trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the matter of clinical trials in a community setting, I have not given immediate consideration to that but obviously it must now be addressed as well, as the emphasis to date was on clinical trials within orphanages and industrial schools. Prior to 1987 there was no statutory basis for the conduct of clinical trials in Ireland but legislation was put in place in 1987 which laid down protocols and so forth for the conduct of clinical trials. The National Drugs Advisory Board was not a statutory body then either, though we have contacted the Irish Medicines <Col N="820" /> Board, which is concentrating today on securing information from the company concerned regarding the allegations made in today's newspaper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>How positive is the Minister that the Irish Medicines Board will be any more successful on this occasion than it was in the past in eliciting information from Wellcome, which is now Glaxo Smithkline? When the Minister published his report on batch No. 3741, it stated that lot No. 84019 did not come from batch No. 3741. If that is the case, what batch did it come from? There were a huge number of reactions to lot No. 84109. If it is the case that that lot did not come from batch No. 3741, as stated in the report, does the Minister know what batch it came from? There were a series of other batches involved; does the Minister know where those came from? That is very pertinent in relation to the lot about which we are talking.</P>
      <P>Given that there were more than 80 adverse reactions, as reported in today's newspaper, recorded in the first six months of 1973, and that lot numbers are available for those, why do the records of the National Drugs Advisory Board note only two suspected adverse reactions for the whole year, none of which have a lot number? </P>
      <P>According to the Minister's documentation on the clinical trials, the injections were given between June 1973 and January 1976, which is well outside the two year period of the licence given to Wellcome. It is also reported that in July 1977, according to a Wellcome memo, Dr. Hillery was still carrying out work in this area related to adverse reactions. Does the Minister agree that these trials were ongoing perhaps up to and including 1977 and maybe later? Can he give us some indication as to whether the consent of parents was obtained in relation to these trials? My information is that it was not. Does the Minister have any information on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding lot No. 84019, the report we published in November last year was a compilation of efforts by departmental officials over the years on behalf of families which came forward looking for information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>And parliamentary questions from Deputies Naughten, Molloy and others. The idea at that time was to produce information to help the families concerned to take legal action against the relevant company. The Department's role over the years was to secure as much information as possible. What we published in November was a compilation of all the information that had been secured to date; it was by no means a definitive or conclusive report on anything. It was a collection of all the various data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know where lot No. 84019 came from. I have been advised we do not have that information but obviously we will pursue that issue now. Regarding June 1973 and the clinical <Col N="821" /> trial in 1976, that will be investigated by the Laffoy Commission&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to my original point, we cannot yet definitively say it was that particular trial within which the animal vaccine was administered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from reading the newspaper that it was a different trial within which the animal vaccine was administered, though that remains to be clarified; we cannot state that definitively yet. The 1973 trial involved an institution and a comparative control group outside that institution and obviously the entirety of that trial comes under the Laffoy Commission, as there are the issues relating to why the control group was not given the changed or trial vaccine. They were given the normal commercial vaccine and the children in care were given the new type of trial vaccine. That is an issue that needs to be teased out. The Laffoy Commission will have the competence to do that. The broader issue does not fall within its remit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>

Does he believe we can cease any contracts that exist after what has happened? I accept that Wellcome is a different company now but the same people are involved. As far as the Minister understands, were people paid to take part in trials for Wellcome in Ireland? This is disputed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>My only knowledge of trials are from the 1970s relating to the Chief Medical <Col N="822" /> Officer's report on vaccine trials within institutions.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Companies have changed and new protocols have emerged. There is a new era in terms of regulatory controls etc. I am conscious that vaccine supplies were usually sourced from two companies to ensure that there was a contingency supply in the event of one company going out of business. It would be foolish to give any commitment in that regard, or to say on the hoof that we will cease our relationship with a company without taking cognisance of the impact that might have on our immunisation programme. I do not want to collapse that programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards protecting the integrity of the vaccination programme and of clinical trials which are an important part of medical development, will the Minister consider dealing with the Wellcome Foundation to assert the importance of getting the full facts on what happened? It is disturbing when such information leaks out through the media. People naturally become concerned. It is difficult when we are dealing with a company that is not in Ireland. Will the Minister take a pro-active role in getting the message across to the Wellcome Foundation, or whatever the company is now called, that it is essential for us to ensure that we have a decent vaccination programme and that this matter is fully investigated?  I presume the Minister will require a public inquiry into the community vaccination trials as opposed to those of children in care. He should take a certain initiative on this matter. He should not just say that we will not take particular vaccines any longer, but assert that we must have all records and information to protect the integrity of the good work being done here in terms of protecting children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious issue in terms of the integrity of the entire vaccination programme. Issues like this can undermine public confidence in the vaccination and immunisation programme. I will the Deputy's view on board and will take up the matter with Wellcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that Wellcome is no longer producing that vaccine? That is important for public confidence. The <Col N="823" /> Minister stated in relation to the trials on 9 November last, that the records of some of them were woefully inadequate. He described the lack of documentation relating to the trials as puzzling and unsatisfactory. With that in mind, what have the Minister and the Department done in the meantime to obtain information from Wellcome?</P>
      <P>Does it not look strange that an eminent scientist such as Dr. Irene Hillery would keep inadequate records? What has happened to Dr. Hillery's notes? They seem to have disappeared. Does the Minister not agree that following today's revelation, with the Department now trying to trace 296 children who received batch No. 3741, and with the Laffoy Commission investigating the initial trial in 1973 of children in homes and in the community, there is a need for a full public inquiry to get to the bottom of this scandal which has gone on for far too long? Parents want to know the truth about what has happened to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spent the last part of his speech trying to allay parents' fears. Does he accept that there are parents that have well-founded, well-informed concerns about vaccination, that these concerns should be respected and that these parents do not wish to have their child vaccinated? Will the Minister assure the House that he will not put forward proposals to discriminate against those parents or children who are not vaccinated? There are proposals emerging in some quarters that children who are not vaccinated should be given less preference in terms of schooling, etc. Will the Minister assure the House that this will not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter point is outrageous. I could not condone any such behaviour. It would be reprehensible for anyone to even contemplate that. I fully respect the right of parents to make a choice. I am a parent, and these choices have to be made by parents in consultation with their general practitioners. As Minister for Health and Children, I am an advocate of immunisation. I know that Deputy Gormley has a different position. I assure him that in any given community when a particular outbreak happens, the rush to get vaccinated is incredible. For instance, when a meningitis case occurs in a class of 20 or 30 children, parents call on the health board to ensure that all those children are vaccinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there cannot be black and white positions on this matter. I have met many interests on this issue including parents' organisations and researchers who have put forward alternative viewpoints. In terms of MMR, those researchers acknowledge that nothing has been proven yet. Nothing conclusive can be drawn from their deliberations. Therefore, the World Health Organisation and many international bodies, including our national authorities, have strongly advocated vaccination and immunisation as a major contributor to public health status, and <Col N="824" /> have urged and advised me to pro-actively promote that issue. I respect the Deputy's views and those of others who have a different perspective.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Naughten's question, his quotation from my speech refers to the vaccine trials that have now been sent to the Laffoy Commission for investigation. The Oireachtas forwarded that to the Laffoy Commission due to the inadequacy of records and information. The Laffoy Commission has the powers to compel and secure documents. Therefore, it is now a matter for the commission to pursue those issues.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Seanad amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Section 2: In page 8, line 7, after &ldquo;centre&rdquo;, &ldquo;or a person whose name is entered on the division of psychiatry or the division of child and adolescent psychiatry of the Register of Medi<Col N="825" /> cal Specialists maintained by the Medical Council in Ireland&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment to section 2 relates to the definition of a consultant psychiatrist. On Committee Stage in the Seanad, concern was expressed that the definition of consultant psychiatrist in the Bill, as initiated, was too narrow. It was felt that any psychiatrist who was not employed by a health board or private psychiatric hospital would not be able to carry out any of the consultant's functions under the Bill. It was brought to the Minister's attention that there is a small but growing number of psychiatrists, fully qualified but operating exclusively in the private sector, who may not be available to the mental health commission as a result of the definition.</P>
      <P>The Minister is anxious that no qualified psychiatrist who would be willing and available to serve at a mental health tribunal or provide an independent report or second opinion under the provisions of the Bill should be excluded from those provisions. Accordingly, an amendment was brought forward on his behalf on Report Stage in the Seanad which broadens the definition of consultant psychiatrist for the purposes of the Bill. The Government amendment adds to the existing definition the phrase &ldquo;or a person whose name is entered on the division of psychiatry or the division of child and adolescent psychiatry of the Register of Medical Specialists maintained by the Medical Council in Ireland&rdquo;. This is a reference to the register of medical specialists maintained by the Medical Council, inclusion in which is a requirement for appointment to the post of consultant psychiatrist in the State. The amendment will ensure any person who has the appropriate qualifications but who is not, for the moment, an employee of a health board or psychiatric hospital can serve on a mental health tribunal or the commission and provide reports and second opinions under the provisions of the Bill. I am sure Deputies will agree this is a positive amendment which will improve the Bill and ensure optimum use can be made by the mental health commission of the medical expertise available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the amendment. However, I wish to raise a particular point in respect of the register of medical specialists maintained by the Medical Council and hope the Minister of State will pursue it. There are some consultants throughout the country who have provided sterling service for the health system during the years but, under the changes to the registration system the Medical Council will put forward shortly, it appears they will be excluded from the register because they held temporary posts. We have depended on these consultants, who are currently practising, whether as psychiatrists or in other specialties, to work within our health service and they are now in <Col N="826" /> danger of losing their right to continue in practice. Will the Minister of State raise this matter, which involves non-national doctors who have been found to be quite suitable to care for sick and dying people but find themselves in a perilous position as a result of the changes the Medical Council intends to propose, with the Minister for Health and Children?</P>

      <P>Seanad amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Seanad amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 8: In page 11, between lines 34 and 35, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Commission shall, from time to time, issue guidelines for staff in approved centres in relation to the provisions of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment refers to section 8 of the Bill which specifies that before an application can be made for the involuntary admission of a person, certain criteria must be met. It also specifies that mental disorder, as defined in section 3, is the sole ground for involuntary admission of a person for psychiatric care and treatment. It further provides that a person cannot be admitted involuntarily by reason only of the fact that he or she is suffering from a personality disorder, socially deviant or addicted to drugs.</P>
      <P>This provision gave rise to much debate in this House and the Seanad. Deputies and Senators were concerned that staff should have some guidance in relation to determining whether a person suffers from a personality disorder or is socially deviant. The Minister remains of the view that a determination as to whether a person is suffering from a personality disorder or is socially deviant is ultimately a matter of clinical judgment. It would be extremely difficult to obtain unanimous agreement among professionals on concrete definitions for those terms. However, in response to the concerns repeatedly expressed in both Houses, the Minister brought forward an amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad to provide that the commission would, from time to time, issue guidelines to staff in approved centres in relation to the operation of this section. It is envisaged that these guidelines will provide some assistance for staff in relation to decisions on admission. However, it must be emphasised that the final decision on whether a person should be involuntarily admitted remains the responsibility of the individual consultant psychiatrist, based on his or her diagnosis of the patient at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment allows the guidelines to be revised by the commission from time to time, as Deputies and Senators had expressed the view <Col N="827" /> that the definition of social deviance, in particular, was likely to change as our culture and society changes. I hope Deputies will agree it is a positive improvement to the Bill and that it will facilitate the provision of valuable guidance for staff operating at the front line in our psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>Seanad amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Seanad amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>Section 24: In page 22, line 16, after &ldquo;psychiatrist&rdquo;&ldquo;who is not a spouse or relative of the person&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 24 which provides that where a voluntary patient has been detained for a period of 24 hours in accordance with section 23, he or she must be referred by the consultant psychiatrist for examination by a second consultant who must confirm that the person should be detained or otherwise direct that they be discharged. On Committee Stage in the Seanad, Senator Henry raised the issue of whether the consultant psychiatrist providing the second opinion should be debarred from being a spouse or relative of the person concerned. She pointed out that this provision already existed in relation to the admitting psychiatrist at section 14(3). Her amendment provides that the second consultant psychiatrist who makes the key decision in relation to the detention of a voluntary patient should not be a spouse or relative of that patient and it was accepted on behalf of the Minister on Report Stage in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>These amendments refer to section 25 which deals with the involuntary admission of children. Section 25 provides that where a health board believes a child is mentally disordered and where that child requires treatment which he or she is unlikely to receive unless an order is made under the section, the health board may make an application to the courts for an order permitting the involuntary admission of the child for psychiatric care and treatment. The decision of the court on whether to detain the child will be greatly influenced by the reports of consultant psychiatrists prepared under the provisions of the section. Senator Henry's amendments, accepted by the Minister on Report Stage in the Seanad, will ensure the consultant psychiatrist providing the reports to the courts will <Col N="828" /> not be a relative of the child. This is an important safeguard and protection for children before the courts and the Minister was happy to adopt the amendments.</P>

      <P>This amendment also refers to section 25. In the Bill, as initiated, section 25(10) provides that an order for a child's detention and treatment may be renewed by the court after 21 days, three months, six months and annually thereafter. However, the point was made on Committee Stage in the Seanad that 12 months is a long period in the life of a child. It was suggested that detention orders in respect of children should be made for a maximum of six months, thus allowing the court to review their case every six months. The Minister understood this concern and was happy to accept the amendment to the Bill on Report Stage in the Seanad. The amendment will ensure the welfare of children involuntarily detained will be kept under regular review by the court. As Minister of State with responsibility for children, I am particularly pleased that this amendment has been accepted because it will keep the Bill in line with other legislation, including the Children Bill which was passed yesterday.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. There is a necessity to upgrade psychiatric units throughout the country. In view of the new national health strategy being introduced, the amendment will prove particularly important for the families of children who must enter care for a long period. It is difficult. The loss of life through depression and suicide is sad. The families who endure it suffer a great deal. The increased funding for psychiatric care is needed. The stigma attached to it has been removed. It is important that the development of psychiatric care and the upgrading of facilities is integrated into acute hospitals. The facilities for children in long-term care are in the interest of patient care, which is the Minister's objective.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns about child and adolescent psychiatry. Earlier this year the working group on the development of these services presented its report to me. It recommended that seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units, for children from six to 16 years of age, be developed. Within the mental health services priority is given to developing such services. Since 1997 additional revenue of over £7 million has been <Col N="829" /> provided for consultant led multi-disciplinary teams. There are now 38 consultant psychiatrist posts. We will see much needed further advances and improvements in this area.</P>

The North Western Health Board has agreed to allocate £5.5 million to mental health care from 2002 to 2006. I hope this funding is ring-fenced and will be visible on the ground. There was a stigma attached to mental health but the amending legislation will improve the situation. The integration of psychiatric units into acute hospitals is important.

      <P>This is the conclusion of the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. The long, considered debate which took place on the different Stages both here and in the Seanad, and the number of amendments, show the interest which Members took in it. The expertise in both Houses is evident in the improvements to the Bill. Such debate is correct considering that it amends a 1945 Act. It gives extra security to those with mental health problems and places on a legal basis the understanding and care we provide in modern society for them. It will receive the resources and the commitment of present and future Governments to redress mistakes of the past and give protection and security to those with mental illness. I thank the officials from the Department of Health and Children who put Trojan work into it during the years and will now take a deserved holiday.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 2(1) of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following after &lsquo;apart from the person' but does include a life partner, a co-habitee or a partner whose role is closely akin to that of a spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage and relates to the principal Act, which places responsibilities on spouses to make declarations or be involved. In modern society, people have close friends or partners who are not defined in the original Act. This amendment is appropriate by including partners or co-habitees who act in a role akin to that of a spouse. During a discussion of other legislation, former Deputy Connolly raised concerns about arrangements concerning those who came and went, as he put it, at various times while the spouse was tied up in legal obligations under different ethics Acts. This is an attempt to be comprehensive and cover all possible combinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this issue on Committee Stage when I agreed to think about what Deputies McGrath, Mitchell and others had said. I am concerned about including a reference to life partners in the legislation. There are broad issues here concerning changes in our society in the last 20 years, as the Deputy accepts. Social mores and standards have changed. A definition of life partner in the Bill could be, in some circumstances, intrusive and I do not want to go that far. If someone is co-habiting with a partner in a way similar to marriage, in either a heterosexual or homosexual arrangement, it might be known to a circle of confidantes but not to an employer or family members. It might in some limited circumstances be an arrangement which the person concerned would be anxious not to have disclosed to an employer or family. Not everyone in our society is comfortable with the idea of co-habitation. When some issue arises that requires a person to make a declaration, for example, a public servant, to a chief executive of his or her organisation do we want the person concerned to have to disclose this aspect of his or her private life or do we want them to lie about their personal circumstances? My preference is not to bring these arrangements within the remit of the Bill for now. Very little domestic legislation addresses this issue and we would have a long way to go towards an accepted definition of co-habitation. The Bill should stand as it is in this regard.</P>

Who will bite the bullet and take on and carry through this issue? The Minister's points are relevant but at the same time if one person has to make the declaration based on his or her relationship then it should apply across the board. We are ducking the issue here and I am disappointed the Minister will not accept it.</P>

It does seem unfair that people in a relationship akin to marriage are treated in a different way to those who are in a normal marital relationship. In fact it is blatantly unfair but I accept the problems of definition and intrusiveness mentioned by the Minister. Like Deputy McGrath I do not know how we can bite this bullet in a manner fair to all concerned but it is an issue that we must keep in mind.</P>

      <P>To show my bona fides it may interest the Deputies to know that we had a good look at this issue internationally. We looked in particular at some societies that seem far more advanced, in some respects, in this area. We found very little in legislation anywhere with regard to the issue and by and large the legislation reflects only the spouse and this is in societies that see themselves as very liberal. I agree the issue will have to be faced but I cannot do it in the context of this specific legislation. Also, I did not want to burden people excessively as they have enough to cope with.</P>

      <P>In page 4, lines 41 and 42, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 41, down to and including &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; in line 42 and substitute &ldquo;who shall be a person nominated by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to membership of the commission and to who should be chair. Instead of the chairperson having to be a judge or a former judge of the Supreme or High Courts we say it should be a person nominated by the Minister. The amendment relates to some of those we debated on Committee Stage. It is necessary that the chairperson of such a commission would be able to prepare and produce his or her tax clearance certificate; we could not expect Members or public servants to be presided over by a chairperson of a public offices commission who might not. The same standards should be applied to the chairperson. We are anxious that the Minister should have a free hand in relation to who should be chairperson and that it would be a person nominated by him who would become chairperson of the body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies' amendment would mean that instead of stipulating that the com<Col N="832" /> mission chairperson will be a judge or former judge of the High or Supreme Courts the chairperson would be any person nominated by the Minister for Finance. This would represent a radical change in the composition of the commission and would be a departure from what is being recommended by a number of groups. Two of the committees which examined the Government's proposals for the Standards in Public Office Bill, the blue book proposals, recommended that the commission be chaired by a judge. The constitution review group and an all-party committee also recommended that the new commission be chaired by a judge or former judge. Moreover, the existing commission has itself expressed the view that it would be a good idea if the new commission was headed by a judge of the superior courts. The new commission may find itself investigating matters akin to those currently being examined by tribunals of inquiry. The Government considers that the commission therefore needs a person with strong legal expertise and experience to act as its head. There was all-party recommendation on this point and if I did not implement it I would be accused of ignoring the committees. It is sound and on balance is the right approach.</P>

      <P>This arises from part of an amendment put down by Deputy Jim Mitchell on Committee Stage. Deputy Mitchell proposed that the Committee on Members Interests would consult with the commission at least twice a year. The amendment I propose does that. I am grateful to Deputy Mitchell for this proposal. There are, of course, issues of overlap and mutual interests between the remit of the committee and that of the commission and some level of communication between them will be valuable in ensuring the effective operation of the legislation. I thank the Deputy and am happy to bring forward an amendment recognising where it came from.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 14, after &ldquo;public&rdquo; where it firstly occurs, to insert &ldquo;or which may damage public confidence in public administration generally&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an issue we debated at considerable length on Committee Stage. Essentially it refers to the nature of the damage that is done to public confidence. The Bill as formulated after Committee Stage effectively says that if something done by someone in his or her particular role affects the public confidence in his or her performance of that role then the matter, provided it is serious enough, can be referred to the commission. This amendment attempts to cast it more generally. If, for example, a senior Garda officer does something not within his remit, such as something less than desirable but not illegal involving planning, it would reflect badly on the performance of public administration generally although it might not necessarily reflect on his capacity to act as a garda. I am sure the Minister could think of far more radical and germane examples than that but the basic point is that I would like the amendment to generalise the concept of damage to public confidence in the administration of public affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave some consideration to this and I understand what the Deputy says. I tried to imagine the sort of extreme examples one would need that suggest this amendment would be necessary but I could not see how it was. I am not disposed to accept the amendment although I do appreciate its intention. The Deputy seeks to deal with a situation where a public official or office holder could do something so serious as to undermine the confidence of the public in the operation of public administration generally but which is remote from the individual's performance of his or her own official duties. It could be argued that it was not actually consistent with the proper performance of the duties of the position. If the existing definition stopped at that point I would agree with the Deputy that it did not go far enough. However, as the Act stands, a specified act can also include an act or omission which is inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in the performance of the official position concerned. It is hard to see whether a case in which a person was shown to be involved in a culpable manner in a very serious matter would undermine confidence in that person's performance of his or her official position. One could certainly construct an example where the matter concerned is very remote from the person's actual performance of his or her duties and the person's official position was one which did not involve any great personal responsibilities. However, would we really want to have such a case within the commission's remit? The commission would probably not want to investigate anyway. This is <Col N="834" /> the argument for the existing narrower definition. For that reason, I will not accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendments discussed and those related to the Bill have been both interesting and helpful in ensuring that we have the correct balance. This issue, like most of the others, is one of judging that balance bearing in mind that, in some respects, we are venturing into uncharted territory.</P>
      <P>The legislation will have to be tested against its application in practice and refined, as necessary, in the light of experience, both on this point and others. I am happy to leave the definition as it is. I am not disagreeing that there is a remote possibility that Deputy McDowell's argument is true. However, the Bill is about right in terms of our being able to enact it.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)(f2&gt;a) Documents submitted to the Commission in pursuance of a complaint or rebuttal thereof shall be exempt from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;b) No such document shall be published in whole or in part except to the extent that the Commission deems it necessary for the purposes of its decision.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> With regard to the commission, complaints, some of which may be spurious or of no substance, can be made by various people. We are concerned that if somebody makes such a complaint to the commission &ndash; subsequently brought to light under the Freedom of Information Act &ndash; it could do great damage to the person concerned, whether it is a Member of this House or a public servant. The provision we are putting forward will exempt such material from being accessible under the Freedom of Information Act. Hence, it will prevent spurious complaints being made available for publication.</P>
    <P>However, we leave matters open to the extent that if the commission, at some stage, deemed it necessary to publish any material, it could do so. The provision does not imply that no information at all should be forthcoming from the commission. It could publish or release documents at its own discretion. We felt that it would be proper if the commission was exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a broad issue requiring discussion regarding how information becomes available from the commission. Currently, similar circumstances obtain with regard to complaints made to the Office of the Ombudsman. Clearly, in adjudicating on a particular complaint, the commission will be required to publish reports, which will come into the possession of this House or the Ceann Comhairle. Presumably, in those reports, a certain number of facts will have to be revealed, whether or not the commission found merit in the complaint made. That is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Although I do not think it is provided for in the Bill, it is likely that the commission will decide, using its discretion, that it might want to present, on a regular basis, something similar to the Ombudsman's report to give an indication of its jurisprudence. The Ombudsman's office does this by taking cases, sometimes anonymously and sometimes identifying the person against whom the complaint is made or by whom the complaint was made. It sets out as many facts as are necessary to guide people in using the process in the future. This would be a reasonable way to progress, i.e., setting out as many facts as are necessary to establish how matters are dealt with to satisfy the recipient of the report that a particular complaint has been dealt with in a fair fashion. Also, it allows a committee form a view on how to move forward. I understand that the Freedom of Information Act does not deal with this &ndash; the Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the amendment of Deputies McGrath and Gay Mitchell, which would provide that the Freedom of Information Act would not apply to material received regard<Col N="836" /> ing a complaint to the Standards in Public Office Commission, I recall some discussion on this point on Committee Stage, and I now have a greater understanding of the points made by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>As regards complaints under the Ethics in Public Office Act, there is no need for this provision. Section 35 of that Act states that a person may not disclose information obtained by him or her under the Act or by being present at a private sitting of the commission, subject to appropriate exceptions.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Bill under discussion provides that the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, be construed together with the Standards in Public Office Bill. This means that the reference to section 35 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, applies equally to the Standards in Public Office Bill. There is already a secrecy provision in the Bill which goes a lot further than Deputies McGrath and Jim Mitchell are providing for in their amendment.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we were at cross purposes in terms of understanding each other on Committee Stage. The old provision prohibits publication subject to the appropriate exceptions, not just of documents submitted by a complainant or in a rebuttal of a complaint, but also documents that might be created within the commission that may contain information obtained under the Act. The Freedom of Information Act applies to the commission but does not override the confidentiality provision in section 35. Therefore, this applies notwithstanding that the Freedom of Information Act applies to the body concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy McDowell, the commission has the ability to produce annual reports and special reports as well.</P>

      <P>5.&ndash;The Commission shall not deal with any complaint unless the identity of the complainant is disclosed to the Commission provided that the Commission may in exceptional circumstances decide that the identity of such complainant will not be disclosed to people other than people designated by the Commission.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments were discussed at some length on Committee Stage. The point was that, in normal circumstances, the commission should not investigate anonymous complaints but could, at its discretion, withhold the identity of a particular complainant if it decided that was the correct thing to do in the interest of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>The amendment arises from an amendment tabled by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage. I indicated on Committee Stage that the thrust of Deputy McDowell's amendment was sound and accordingly I undertook to give serious consideration to it before Report Stage. Amendment No. 17 provides that the commission or a committee will not be able to consider a complaint if the identity of the complainant is not known to the commission or committee. I wanted both the commission and committees to be included in this amendment as there would not be much point in including the commission without including committees too.</P>
      <P>Where the commission or committee considers that the circumstances so warrant, they may restrict disclosure of the complainant's identity where it is necessary for the investigation of the complaint. Section 35 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provides that information obtained by a person under the Act or as a result of having been present at a private sitting of a committee or commission shall not be disclosed. To do so is an offence punishable by a fine, imprisonment or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline the levels of penalty involved for the benefit of Members. A fine not exceeding £1,000, or a prison term not exceeding six months or both will be imposed for a summary conviction. On conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £20,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both will be imposed. Natural justice dictates that the subject of a complaint should know the identity of the <Col N="838" /> complainant. Unlike Deputy McDowell's Committee Stage amendment, significantly the amendment proposed applies not only to the commission which can investigate complaints concerning office holders and public officials, but also to select committees which can equally hear complaints about Members. Everything is therefore encompassed in this amendment and I thank Deputy McDowell for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>

      <P>We should state that in normal circumstances I expect the identity of the complainant would be disclosed. This amendment caters for what one would expect to be exceptional circumstances, where the job done by the person making the complaint or supplying the information would normally prohibit them from disclosing information. Such people may include public servants or bank officials who become aware of serious irregularities. In effect, this amendment allows a form of protection for whistleblowers in certain circumstances, when the commission will decline to disclose publicly the identity of the complainant. It is important that we state that in normal circumstances the identity of the complainant will be known.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A new section was introduced into this Bill on Committee Stage to protect those making bona fide complaints to the commission. The important feature of the new section 5 is that a complaint to the commission or committee must be made reasonably and in good faith if the complainant is to enjoy immunity from any action arising from the complaint. Such protection will be denied to a person who makes a complaint knowing it to be false, misleading, frivolous or vexatious or who furnishes misleading information to an inquiry <Col N="839" /> officer of the commission or a clerk of a committee.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, will apply to a dismissal of an employee who makes a complaint under this Bill. Such a dismissal will be deemed unfair for the purposes of the 1977 Act. Subsection (4) defines disciplinary action for the purposes of the section and encompasses actions, intended as a punishment, taken in relation to the employment of someone other than the complainant. It also covers third party actions taken against a complainant at the instigation of the person subject to the complainant and in that circumstance both the instigator and the person taking the action will be deemed to have taken the disciplinary action involved. I signalled on Committee Stage that I wished to come back to this on Report Stage to deal with the penalties to apply where an employer takes inappropriate disciplinary action against a complainant.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 make it an offence for an employer to take disciplinary action against a complainant who has made a proper complaint. The penalty on summary conviction is £1,500 and on indictment £50,000. The amendments cover the situation where a person takes disciplinary action against a complainant at the instigation of another person. That will protect persons who might be disciplined by employers having made a complaint against a client or friend of the employer.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;(1) Before the commencement of this Act the Minister shall, by Order, set out in detail the procedure for making, processing and rebutting complaints.</P>
    <P>(2)(<i>a</i>) The Order made under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall also provide for summary dismissal of complaints deemed to be vexatious or frivolous.</P>

    <P>(3) The Order made under <i>subsection (1) </i>shall provide an appeal procedure against any decision on a complaint by the Commission under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from our discussion on Committee Stage. The amendment provides for the setting out of details regarding the making, processing and rebutting of complaints, in other words, the entire procedure of making a complaint should be set out in detail by the Minister by order. This amendment provides that if somebody makes a vexatious or frivolous complaint, they should be penalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave this some thought after Committee Stage. Deputy Jim Mitchell's wish that anybody making a vexatious complaint should be hanged, drawn and quartered before breakfast and the process repeated after lunch if needs be struck me as a little excessive. Nonetheless, there is a case for deterring people from making a vexatious complaint. Perhaps the way to do so is to give the commission a function equivalent to awarding costs so there is a small financial deterrent. In this case we are obviously talking about a complaint dismissed at the very start of the process, so we are not talking about significant costs. It seems reasonable to me that there be some deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provides that the commission and committees should decide on the details of internal procedures in relation to complaints. Sections 22 and especially 32(6) specify a wide range of areas in which procedures should be determined. This is appropriate as only these bodies will develop an expertise over time in relation to the processing of complaints. Moreover, the Bill makes a number of additions to make the skeleton of the complaints procedure more explicit than heretofore. There is no explicit requirement for publication of the procedures, but it is expected that the commission or committee will make clear the procedures it intends to follow in a particular case. The current commission published its investigation procedures in its 1997 report. The Dáil Committee on Members' Interests published a memorandum on the procedures it followed during its investigation of the case of Deputy Foley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> As regards the issue of frivolous and vexatious cases, it is not appropriate to create an offence as the existence of such a provision might deter genuine complainants. There are already considerable new provisions designed as safeguards against frivolous and vexatious complaints and against those lacking substance, which is legally quite different. A person who makes a frivolous or vexatious complaint may have costs awarded against him or her, as I said on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not clear that the costs were being awarded against somebody; I thought they were simply awarded to cover costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be either. Deputy McDowell raised this matter on Second Stage and I confirmed that I would deal with it on Committee Stage. Government amendments aimed at protecting those who make complaints from liability will not be applicable to frivolous and vexatious complaints. As regards the question of an appeals procedure, it should be noted that the committees and the commission will not set out penalties as their function is to assess facts and make recommendations. In the case of Members, it is the relevant House that will make the final determination. It is inappropriate that there should be a right of appeal against a decision of the House.</P>
      <P>The commission's findings concerning public servants will be telling, but the decision in relation to any penalties will have to be taken within normal procedures. An appeal against the findings of the commission does not seem appropriate. It may be that Deputies will have in mind the situation regarding Electoral Acts, where the commission can make a report to the DPP about suspected offences. While any amendment to the Electoral Acts would be better dealt with in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill currently going through the Oireachtas, no penalty would be imposed unless the DPP decided to prosecute and the person was found guilty. It is a separate matter, in any event.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has clarified the position but nonetheless we are all aware that frivolous or vexatious complaints can be made which can do serious damage. The Tipperary South by-election campaign is ongoing and if a complaint against any candidate received publicity, the damage could be done in the ballot box to him or her before he or she had an opportunity to rebut it. Unless there is a rigorous sanction against the complainant in the form of a fine it is possible such complaints will be made for electoral rather than substantive reasons. That is a worry and the reason we tabled the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is an important aspect of the legislation on which all of us enunciated our views on Second and Committee Stages. I hope the amendments that have been made will tighten the section and discourage frivolous and vexatious <Col N="842" /> accusations. We all live in the real world and no matter how much legislation is enacted by us people will still see fit to take certain actions for whatever reason. However, the legislation is as tight as we can make it and I do not propose to go further at this stage. I cannot think of any legislation introduced in the history of the State that was deemed to be perfect on day one. One must wait in certain instances to ascertain how the issues covered by the legislation evolve and whether the legislation is working as intended. If not, we may revisit it.</P>

      <P>This arises from a Committee Stage amendment tabled by Deputy McDowell. I indicated my agreement to the objective of his amendment and undertook to address the issue on Report Stage. The amendment will provide that an inquiry officer could seek evidence from whom he or she considered might be relevant to his or her inquiry. This provision will, therefore, mean in making his or her preliminary assessment an inquiry officer will not be confined to discussions with the complainant and the person against whom the complaint has been made. It broadens the remit of the officer somewhat but is in keeping with the purpose of having an effective screening process for complaints.</P>

That is the reason I tabled a provision that he or she should be allowed to carry out such investigations as were deemed necessary to decide whether a <i>prima facie</i> case exists. If the Minister of State is satisfied my point has been addressed, I am happy to concur with him.

Deputies Mitchell and McGrath dealt with this issue on Second Stage and asked that the legislation be improved in this respect. They were correct that the Bill was inadequate in that regard and in the light of their contributions I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for costs using the model of the relevant provisions of the tribunals legislation.</P>
      <P>I inserted a new section 8 providing that where a committee or the commission considers that it is justified it can decide to award all or part of the costs of a person appearing by way of a solicitor or counsel. Deputy McDowell suggested that in some cases a person might require professional assistance of, say, an accountant rather than a solicitor or barrister. The amendment, therefore, deletes the reference to solicitors and barristers and, thus, allowing that an award of costs can address all appropriate costs even where the person concerned is not represented by a solicitor or barrister.

Such consultation will take place in any event and the amendment copperfastens that in the legislation.

      <P>The amendment relates to the nub of Deputy Mitchell's problem with the legislation. I refer again to the practical example of the upcoming by-election. Vexatious complaints carry much more status if they are made by a Member of either House of the Oireachtas and if an allegation is made in the House, the person making it has immunity. By the time the allegation is investigated by the commission and rebutted, severe damage can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a Member of this House, whom we would like to have seen severely punished, repeatedly made an allegation against Deputy Mitchell and even when it was investigated and established that there was no difficulty with what he had done and no need to take the issue any further, the Member continued to make the alle<Col N="845" /> gation. Another Member with whom I was involved in a radio discussion raised the allegation again. He said Deputy Mitchell had not explained his position regarding the allegation and questioned whether there was still a shadow of doubt over him. This happened after the relevant legislation had been complied with and it was found Deputy Mitchell did not have a case to answer.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that we are anxious that a sanction should be provided in the legislation against Members who would make similar allegations. It is a great honour to be a Member of this House and represent one's constituency but we are also under significant obligations. We must deal with our colleagues in a reasonable manner and one should not make allegations against a colleague that cannot be substantiated. One can do so in the House under privilege and there are minor sanctions if one cannot substantiate allegations that one makes.</P>
    <P>However, the amendment would strengthen the legislation and provide redress for an aggrieved Member if he or she felt a colleague had wronged him or her. It provides a mechanism through which Members can make complaints to the commission.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we tabled this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>This is the jail Deputy Roche amendment which we discussed at great length on Committee Stage. I said at the time that to incarcerate Deputy Roche in the circumstances was probably a little harsh. It is, nonetheless, a subject worthy of thought. We have struck a balance in this House by requiring that people behave according to certain rules of honour and that if a person says something about a Member in the House which does not stand up, he or she can be disciplined internally. If one impugns the integrity of a Member outside the House, the only sanction against him or her is the defamation laws. However, as Deputy McGrath rightly pointed out, that is a long and tedious way of trying to vindicate one's good standing and name.</P>
      <P>The proposition that we would look to restrict what people say outside the House about other Members, whether impugning their personal integrity or otherwise, and try to put in place a mechanism to censor them is too much for us to swallow. Although the current system and the defamation laws dealing with circumstances where people deliberately and vexatiously impugn someone else's integrity are imperfect, it would not be proper for us to attempt to censor and gag people in that way. Unfortunately, the cut and thrust of politics sometimes gets a bit out of hand, although it does not happen too often. It is too much to censor people in those circumstances outside what already exists in law.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputies Jim Mitchell and McGrath would require that codes of conduct for Members of either House contain a provision making it an <Col N="846" /> offence to raise in public a query about or to challenge a Member's declaration of interests except by lodging a formal complaint with the commission. I indicated on Committee Stage that I was not in favour of legislation stipulating what should or should not be in a code of conduct for Members. The Government is providing in the Bill that the select committees of the Houses will draw up such codes which a House can then apply to itself by resolution. The Deputies will appreciate that constitutionally and otherwise it was right and proper that the Houses decide on their own codes of conduct. It would be a major departure if we went down this road. I am reluctant, therefore, to put into legislation anything which restricts the latitude of the Houses in regard to the content of their codes. I suggest the Deputy might raise the matter when the code comes before the House for discussion in due course.</P>
      <P>I note that the report to the Committee on Members' Interests, which considered the code and made a number of inputs into this Bill, did not at any stage suggest such an offence. I have some doubts also about the appropriateness of a provision that would see an offence specified in a code of conduct. I would have thought that would not stand up to scrutiny. If an offence is required, and I am unconvinced, it would need to have been specified in the primary legislation. I appreciate where Deputy Jim Mitchell is coming from, but it is a bridge too far.</P>

      <P>The Deputy proposes a new section requiring the commission to produce a code on reporting standards in relation to declarations under the ethics and electoral Acts and complaints about those declarations. The proposal can be summarised as follows: a draft code on reporting standards should be published within 90 days of the commencement of the Act; on publication, the commission should seek comments from interested parties within another 90 days; within a further 90 days a final code should be published which should take effect 60 days later unless challenged in court and a deliberate breach of this code on reporting standards will be an offence.</P>
      <P>We gathered from Committee Stage that reporting standards here refer to journalists reporting matters concerned with ethics, declarations and complaints procedures. However, as tempting as the idea is in principle, I have some concerns about the fact that the Deputy's amendment will create a new offence of misreporting. Under the amendment proposed, if a journalist does not live up to the reporting standards laid down, he or she would be committing an offence. The motives behind such a proposal may be entirely worthy but, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, the proposal goes into territory which we have not considered for the purposes of this Bill. In effect, the commission would become the setter of standards for press reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also mentioned that the extension of this principle to other areas could easily lead to absurd consequences. The examples I gave were that we might have the Central Bank setting out standards for reporting of banking issues, the Garda Commissioner laying down the law on reporting of crime and so on. This would represent a new departure in press regulation. Such a departure would require detailed study and consideration, <Col N="848" /> including the legal and constitutional aspects which cannot be achieved within the timescale for this Bill. I accept there are unique features of this new arrangement for investigations.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to accept this amendment today, the practical experience of the operation of the new commission and the committees may give rise to further thought on the matter. In the meantime, there are protections which would not apply, for example, in respect of an open hearing of a case in court. The commission and committees have discretion to hold their hearings in private and it will be an offence for any person who attends such a hearing to disclose information obtained at the hearing or under the Act generally. This combination gives the commission or committees considerable control over the dissemination of information arising from proceedings before them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26: </P>
      <P>In page 21, line 34, after &ldquo;<i>21</i>&rdquo; to insert  &ldquo;, <i>22</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment to tidy up references in the Bill arising from Committee Stage amendments. A number of amendments were made on Committee Stage to sections of the Bill dealing with tax clearance certificates for various categories of person. For example, a new section was inserted to provide that candidates for judicial office would have to furnish a tax clearance certificate before appointment to the Bench. Section 24 sets out details of the tax clearance certificates for the purpose of the relevant sections of the Bill. The amendment is to ensure that all the relevant sections are properly referenced in section 24 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;25.&ndash;If the Commission or the Revenue Commissioners shall at any time after the issue of a tax clearance certificate obtain information which suggests that inaccurate or incomplete information had been furnished to the Revenue Commissioners prior to the issue of a tax clearance certificate the Revenue may rescind such tax clearance certificate and shall notify the Commission that it has done so.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the circumstances where a tax clearance certificate is issued by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of a Member of the Houses and it subsequently transpires that the information given to the Revenue Commissioners to enable them to issue the certificate was either incomplete or inaccurate. This goes to the heart of what the tax clearance certificate is <Col N="849" /> meant to do. The process signals to the House and beyond it that someone's tax affairs are not in order. There is no sanction for this and that position can continue for several years. It could continue for the course of the entire Dáil. If information becomes available to the Revenue Commissioners that someone got a tax clearance certificate but the information provided at the time was wrong or incomplete, the Revenue can revoke the clearance certificate. The clearance certificate is a type of <i>nihil obstat</i>, although I am not sure that is the right phrase; I am getting my clerical references mixed up. It basically states there is nothing wrong and that a person is above board and his or her tax affairs are in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite. It is based on the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. However, if it subsequently transpires that the individual's tax affairs are not in order, it logically follows that the Revenue should revoke or rescind the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue got a good airing on Committee Stage. Deputy McDowell is correct. Tax clearance certificates are required now for contractors who take on work for local authorities and so on. If they do not have the tax clearance certificate within a particular timeframe, they cannot get those contracts. There is a time lag in that regard. If it is subsequently found that the tax clearance certificate is not in order, there should be a mechanism whereby the commission can take the relevant measures. That is what is contained in this amendment, which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter at some length and have actually gone further than what Deputy McDowell is suggesting in the amendment. Deputy McDowell's amendment would empower the Revenue Commissioners to rescind a tax clearance certificate where they consider that the certificate was based on false or incomplete information. We discussed this matter on Committee Stage. The important point to bear in mind is that a tax clearance certificate is simply a snapshot of a person's tax position. Moreover, it certifies only that the person has made returns required and that the tax he or she is paying is consistent with those returns. It is not to be taken as a statement from the Revenue that the person is fully tax compliant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is perhaps a misunderstanding about what is a tax clearance certificate. The tax clearance sections of the Bill are two-pronged for which there is a specific reason. A person has to produce both a certificate and a statutory declaration that his or her tax affairs are in order. The statutory declaration is far more significant in terms of the continuation of a person in a position. Allied to that is the significant increase in the penalties for making a false statutory <Col N="850" /> declaration provided for in the Bill. That is significant.</P>
    <P>To accept Deputy McDowell's amendment would be to potentially embroil the Revenue Commissioners in political controversy. I would be extremely uneasy about such a development; all Members of the House might be uneasy also. That could be seen to undermine the independence of the Revenue Commissioners, which would be disastrous. The tax clearance regime we are establishing in the Bill will be consistent with that pertaining to persons seeking licences and public contracts with the added extra, as I have just outlined, of the statutory declaration, which is most significant.</P>
    <P>The existing tax clearance schemes for these categories do not provide for rescinding of a tax clearance certificate. Obviously, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment based on what I said. If a person is found to have given incorrect information that would be a breach of tax law and a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to pursue, do we really want them reporting what is, in effect, an offence without having brought that offence through all the appropriate procedures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members on all sides of the House, in particular the spokespersons from the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who put great time and effort into the passing of the Bill through all Stages. They were extremely helpful in bringing their experience to bear on the Bill and recognising the work of the committees also. We now have a good Bill which has been improved substantially since its publication. The <Col N="852" /> effectiveness of the Standards in Public Office Bill will be all the better for it.</P>
      <P>I hope Members find that when I bring legislation before the House, I actually listen to what people say and try to respond when sensible points are made or if something that we have missed is highlighted. I recognise that all Members of the House have the capacity to influence and improve legislation brought before the House. No font of wisdom resides in any one particular place.</P>
      <P>I thank, in particular, my officials who gave me a lot of help and advice in drafting this legislation. They were very keen to see a good Standards in Public Office Bill brought forward that will stand the test of time, contribute to the improved standing of politicians, our Civil Service and everybody else, and create in the minds of the public the idea that we have a good, transparent and open system.</P>
      <P>I genuinely thank all concerned, but particularly Deputies Mitchell, McGrath and McDowell for their efforts and attention to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have reached the stage where the Standards in Public Office has passed through Dáil Éireann. I thank the Minister of State for his co-operation over the period we were dealing with the Bill. He listened to what we said and either accepted many of the amendments or came forward with better amendments in place of them. Not all amendments will be accepted, but we appreciate the fact that the Minister of State listened to what we were saying. I thank him for that and the civil servants for their help.</P>
      <P>It may be only a short time before the effects of the Bill come into force, and perhaps Members elected to the next Dáil will have to produce their tax clearance certificates. I hope everyone present will be in such a position that it will be required of them. I am sure they will be able to deal with it at that stage but, I hope, we will be in the position where we are asked to supply them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The passage of this legislation has been interesting in so far as it has been around for a long time. To my knowledge, it went through the Members' interests committees of both Houses and was also discussed in draft form by way of Government proposals by the finance committee last year or the year before last; my memory is beginning to fail me at this stage. Certainly it has gone through a much longer than usual legislative process. In a sense, it is the type of legislation we would prefer not to introduce in the first place. Unfortunately, as I think all of us acknowledge, the standing of politicians and politics in Irish life has rarely, if ever, been lower and the least we can do is provide a mechanism which will allow us to mercilessly expose the very few rotten apples in the bunch. This legislation is one part of doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge what the Minster of State said in his concluding remarks. He has been particularly <Col N="853" /> positive and forthcoming in accepting Opposition amendments, certainly amendments put forward by me, and I appreciate the generous way in which he has approached them.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State and his officials. The Bill has been a long time in germination and now that it has got to the end of the process, let us hope we do not see much of this commission.</P>

      <P>When I drafted my request to raise this matter on the Adjournment the death toll in the hunger strike by political prisoners and their supporters stood at 23. Since then the toll has risen and a 25th person died on hunger strike on Tuesday. From late last year hundreds of prisoners from Turkish and Kurdish political organisations have been fasting in protest at the imposition of a new prison regime which adds greatly to the brutality already experienced by political prisoners in that country. Relatives have also fasted in solidarity and are among the dead.</P>
      <P>In our struggle for freedom 22 people have died on hunger strike since 1917 and three of them &ndash; Terence McSwiney, Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty &ndash; were elected representatives of the Irish people. Former Deputy Kieran Doherty was elected in Cavan-Monaghan, the constituency which I, and you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, have the honour to represent in this House.</P>
      <P>A prison protest by political prisoners has a deep resonance with the Irish people. The comparisons between the current crisis in Turkish jails and our own experience in Ireland are striking. In December last year prisoners were forcibly transferred from large dormitory-style prisons to new maximum security prisons with one or three person cells. This forcible movement took place among scenes of great violence in which prisoners were killed. Just as attempted criminalisation in the H-blocks replaced imprisonment of political prisoners in Long Kesh concentration camp, so the Turkish regime is attempting to criminalise its political hostages in F-type prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prisoners concerned come from a wide variety of political groupings with varying demands. However, it is clear that all are victims of prison brutality in a state which is notorious the world over for its human rights violations. Turkey has more than 10,000 political prisoners and they are trade unionists, human rights activists, democrats, artists, socialists, writers, Kurd<Col N="854" /> ish nationalists and so on. The torture and isolation in Turkish prisons have been condemned by groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture. The Turkish Government has remained impervious. A media wall of silence has surrounded the prison crisis inside and outside Turkey. Given the fact that Turkey is one of the states seeking membership of the European Union under enlargement, and given the fact that we who opposed the Nice Treaty were told we were against enlargement and isolationist, this media and political silence is ironic. I strongly urge the Government to protest in the strongest possible terms to the Government of Turkey. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains seriously concerned about the situation in Turkish prisons. Issues concerning overcrowding, lack of proper sanitation and allegations of serious human rights abuses have been regularly raised by humanitarian organisations. The current hunger strike by prisoners has highlighted the need for urgent reform of the prisons and the whole penal system.</P>
      <P>In recent days another prisoner has died from hunger strike, bringing the death toll to 25. The Irish ambassador to Turkey has raised the matter of the hunger strikes at the highest level, including with Foreign Minister Cem. On that occasion the ambassador strongly reiterated the Government's appeal of 25 April to the Turkish Government to continue its efforts to address existing problems and prevent further tragic loss of life. Ireland has also called on the prisoners and their representatives to participate as a matter of urgency in efforts to seek a solution.</P>
      <P>Ireland is working closely with our European partners on the issue. The European Union has, from the outset, been actively involved in encouraging efforts to bring the hunger strikes to an end and EU representatives on the ground in Ankara are constantly in touch with the Turkish authorities in that regard. Most recently, at the EU Association Council with Turkey, held in Brussels on 26 June, the Union stressed to Foreign Minister Cem the priority it attached to a just and humanitarian resolution of the hunger strike issues and the general reform of the prison system in Turkey.</P>
      <P>The hunger strike was initiated as part of a protest which began last October against the introduction of new prisons &ndash; so-called F-type prisons &ndash; in which prisoners are accommodated in cells for three or four inmates, rather than in dormitories &ndash; so-called E-type prisons. The strikers have also demanded amendment of the anti-terrorism law concerning the rights of association of prisoners within the jails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hunger strikers are divided by themselves and human rights NGOs into two groups &ndash; those who refuse to eat solid food, but continue to consume sugared water and vitamin tablets, and <Col N="855" /> those who are described as being on a death fast. It is estimated that 200 people are on death fast in 30 prisons. Over 500 people are on hunger strike in sympathy. Most of the striking prisoners have been convicted of offences under antiterrorism legislation.</P>
    <P>According to Turkey, the main aim of the move to F-type units is to allow the authorities to regain control in prisons from criminal and other groups. It is believed that control had largely been lost because of the dormitory-style accommodation prevalent in Turkish prisons. This allowed group leaders to establish and maintain group discipline, often through the use of torture and terror. However, prisoners and human rights organisations have protested that the cellular structure of the new prisons might facilitate prisoner abuse through isolation and an enhanced risk of torture.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which has expertise in this area, has been working with the Turkish Government and the prisoners in the search for a resolution of the prisons dispute. It has made several visits to Turkey to visit the prisons and meet the Turkish authorities and prisoners. It is providing detailed advice, both in relation to the management of F-type prisons and regarding the action which needs to be taken to gain the confidence of prisoners and create the conditions for the crisis to end.</P>
    <P>The Committee for the Prevention of Torture has stated that there is no objection in principle to the move towards smaller living units, always provided that inmates have the opportunity to spend a reasonable part of each day outside their living units engaged in purposeful activities. It has stressed that the introduction of smaller living units for prisoners must under no circumstances be allowed to lead to a generalised system of small group isolation.</P>
    <P>However, the committee has made very clear that provided prisoners are not subject to a system of isolation and offered a satisfactory programme of activities in communal facilities outside their cells and living units, conditions of detention in F-type prisons will be in conformity with European standards. In this regard, the committee has highlighted the need for the Turkish authorities to address issues surrounding communal activities, independent monitoring, complaints of ill-treatment and, where appropriate, the prosecution of state officials. The committee is closely monitoring the steps being taken by Turkey regarding its recommendations.</P>
    <P>A delegation from the European Parliament led by Daniel Cohn-Bendit travelled to Turkey at the beginning of June to visit the prisons and meet with the Turkish authorities and prisoners. The delegation described the conditions in the E &ndash; type dormitory style prisons as inhuman and unsanitary and considered the move to more modern conditions was long overdue. It found the <Col N="856" /> buildings in the F &ndash; type prisons in good condition with good levels of cleanliness and lighting.</P>
    <P>However, the common facilities foreseen to permit prisoners to undertake out-of-cell activities and ensure there would be no sense of isolation, were not ready. The delegation stressed to the Turkish authorities that every effort must be made to provide these as a matter of urgency. Other recommendations made by the delegation included the need for a more reliable complaints procedure to be set up, greater social contact between prisoners and prisoners to be allowed visits from friends and not just family. However, having seen the conditions in F-type prisons the delegation indicated that it did not consider there was sufficient reason to continue the death fasts.</P>
    <P>Several steps have already been taken by Turkey to deal with the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the European Parliament.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Further action is clearly required but, as the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture has stated, bringing the hunger strike to an end will require a process of adaptation, explanation and confidence building. The committee continues its efforts to identify and set in train the key threads of that process. As I have mentioned, these include a determined and visible effort by the Turkish authorities to develop communal activities in F-type prisons. This is crucial as discussions with prisoners have suggested that although they do not want to return to the kind of conditions they lived in prior to being <Col N="857" /> moved to the F-type prisons, the issue of isolation remains a major concern.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for independent monitoring of the introduction of such communal activities. Steps aimed at convincing prisoners that their life security will be guaranteed in F-type prisons are also necessary. Ireland fully supports the ongoing efforts of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture to help bring an end to the hunger strike crisis in co-operation with the Turkish authorities. The Government urges that every appropriate action be taken as a matter of urgency to bring an end to the crisis and to the tragic loss of life. We also urge Turkey to make every effort to speed up the process of overall penal and prison reform so as to bring this area into line with European norms and standards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an gCeann Comhairle gur thug sé deis dom an fhadhb seo a phlé anocht. Recently, I was contacted by members of a group who is looking after the disabled. They told me that a vacancy for the position of telephonist in a county council office could not be filled by a blind person because he did not have his leaving certificate. I presumed that somebody had got their wires crossed and that this could not happen in this era of equality legislation for disabled people. I tabled a question for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, however, and discovered that at local level &ndash; which, I presume, applies also to the Civil Service &ndash; the qualifications include a requirement that candidates should have obtained at least a pass in their leaving certificate subjects. Just imagine &ndash; is it not an achievement for a blind person to learn how to operate a telephone exchange? We should be giving them a gold medal rather than telling them that because they do not have the leaving certificate they cannot get a job in a county council office.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank an official in the Department of Finance who rang me to discuss the matter, and I now realise that the Civil Service does not have such a rule. However, I wish to make a plea for the disabled. In this day and age, it is totally unacceptable that a condition such as the leaving certificate should be applicable for a telephonist position or for other county council jobs. The handicapped have suffered enough in life and we should reward them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the question I tabled regarding the Civil Service is not fully accurate since it does not apply to the Minister's remit, but to the county councils. The Minister should deal with trade unions which are insisting on keeping such regulations in place, as they seem to do when it comes to flexibility agreements with new firms. A disabled person cannot be asked to move all over an office or factory doing different types of work. We should be serious about dealing with people <Col N="858" /> with disability rather than just discussing the matter in legislative terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can respond only for the requirements governing appointment to the grade of visually impaired telephonist in the Civil Service. The minimum educational requirements attaching to similar grades elsewhere in the public service are matters for my ministerial colleagues. I understand, for instance, that yesterday the Minister for the Environment and Local Government responded to a parliamentary question from the Deputy in respect of the employment of blind persons as telephonists in local authorities.</P>
      <P>There are no formal minimum educational requirements for appointment as a visually impaired telephonist in the Civil Service. The most recent open competition held by the Civil Service Commission was advertised in 1996 when two competitions were announced, one for vacancies in the Dublin area and one for vacancies in provincial areas. The competitions were confined to persons who are blind to the extent that either they cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or that they cannot continue the occupation which they were following before being trained in switchboard operating, and are registered with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland as technically blind, or satisfy the medical criteria to be so registered.</P>
      <P>A successful applicant will be required to produce a certificate of visual acuity before being appointed. This certificate provides an assessment of the level of disability. As regards requirements, all that was required was that candidates have adequate training in, or experience of, switchboard operating and be able to read and write grade II Braille, or be able to read and write using low vision aids. The competition consisted, <i>inter alia</i>, of an interview and qualifying practical tests in reading, writing and switchboard operating.</P>
      <P>The 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service was established by a Government decision of March 1977. The target applies to all types of employment in the public service, including the Civil Service, local authorities, health boards and semi-State bodies. It does not apply to the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service. The Department of Finance is responsible for the operation of the target in the Civil Service. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform chairs a committee which monitors the position in the wider public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1977, the 3% target has been a key element of Government policy in its approach towards people with disabilities. It has also been endorsed in successive national agreements. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness underlines the importance of Departments achieving the 3% figure. The target has, in general, met the policy aim of providing employment for people with disabilities by ensuring opportunities which might not otherwise be available. It provides a <Col N="859" /> very clear and effective way of meeting the policy objective.</P>
    <P>Experience with the target has been good. The 3% figure was maintained for the three years between 1993 and 1995. However, in recent years there has been a decline. It is now estimated that in 2000 the percentage was 2.6%. While Civil Service numbers are continuing to increase, the actual number of civil servants with disabilities has fallen from 829 in 1995 to 757 last year. This trend must be reversed and I can assure the House that the Government is taking action.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the Government wants to make certain that Departments are fully aware of what can now be done to change existing jobs to accommodate people with disabilities. In the second place, we have to encourage people with disabilities to consider the Civil Service as an attractive employment opportunity. If we can make improvements in these areas, we would have more jobs for people with disabilities and we would be encouraging more people to take up the posts which do become available.</P>
    <P>FÁS and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland were asked to examine the duties carried out by clerical officers in the Department of Finance and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The idea was to see what technology might be available to allow people with disabilities to carry out tasks which might not have previously been carried out by them. The report, which was finalised last December, found that a lot of existing clerical work could <Col N="860" /> be carried out by visually impaired people by the introduction of relatively cheap IT equipment.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service has to ensure that staff with disabilities are encouraged to develop their careers to the maximum extent possible. This is an issue which needs careful monitoring because a failure on this front would act as an obstacle to people with disabilities entering the service.</P>
    <P>To find out what is happening, the Department of Finance's equality unit and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have commissioned research on the career progression of people with disabilities to see if there are problems and to identify solutions. The researchers will study three large and three small Departments, comparing the career progress of people with disabilities against that of other people recruited at the same time. A sample survey of people with disabilities, to find out their views and experience, will also be carried out. The views of other staff towards people with disabilities will also be surveyed. Where obstacles to the career progression of people with disabilities are identified, the consultants will make specific recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Government is confident that these initiatives will make a significant difference to the implementation of the 3% target over the medium term. The Government is determined to ensure that the 3% target is met. Every encouragement will be given to Departments to employ people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 6 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 29 June 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of medical services at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is also aware, at the request of the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the National Cancer Forum established a sub-group to examine the provision of services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The sub-group had the following terms of reference: &ldquo;To assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the National Breast Cancer Screening Programme; the increase in the target population; the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening; and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services; and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
      <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought on how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-group considered that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective <Col N="862" /> treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    <P>When I received the report of the Sub-Group on the Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, I established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group met Western Health Board officials and clinicians following which the board considered the development of specialist breast disease services and adopted a plan for this development. This plan was submitted to my Department and has been the subject of discussions with the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the development of specialist breast disease services in the Western Health Board area are being actively considered within the Department and this involves services at Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the funding of services at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline a number of recent developments at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. First, the Deputy will be pleased to note that my Department approved a capital allocation of £1.6 million in 1998 for a new accident and emergency, Department at the hospital. Work on this development has since been completed and the new building became operational in the first week in April 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am informed by the authority that St. Philomena's day ward was opened on 17 April this year and occupies the first floor of the accident and emergency wing. This development has increased day capacity at the hospital from 14 to 19 places and will allow for medical day care activity at the hospital in addition to the existing surgical workload. The total cost associated with the construction, staffing and equipment of both departments was £2.7 million. To staff and run the units it will cost £500,000 per annum. I am advised by the authority that both of these departments are now open and functioning well.</P>
      <P>The authority also advises that the hospital proposes to extend its old day ward to accommodate a new surgical ward. This ward will have some isolation facilities which will add to the hospitals bed capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various other projects in train in the hospital including: refurbishment of the casualty <Col N="863" /> lane, extending the laboratory, extending the outpatient department, extending St. Frances's clinic, upgrading central sterile supply department and formula room, refurbishment of canteen and dining area and upgrading the laundry.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that within five to seven years the hospital will relocate to the Mater campus. A number of joint project steering groups are already in place and planning has started for the development of facilities on the new site.</P>
    <P>I will visit the hospital in the coming weeks to see at first hand the improvement in patient facilities resulting from the significant investment in the hospital infrastructure which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>The specific data requested by the Deputy are not routinely collected by my Department and I have therefore asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief executive officer of each health board to collate the figures for their respective regions and to forward them directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The referral of patients abroad scheme is administered by the regional health boards in respect of cases which arise in their respective region. The criteria for the referral of patients abroad are the same for all cases where treatment is sought. The criteria are as follows: the treatment concerned is not available in this country; there is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment; there is a reasonable medical prognosis; the treatment is regarded as a proven form of medical treatment and is recommended by the patient's consultant; the treatment is to be carried out in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the health authority or health board concerned to examine the circumstances of each individual case and to decide whether the foregoing criteria have been met. The assessment of whether the treatment sought is appropriate for the individual concerned is the clinical responsibility of the consultant involved based on his or her professional judgment.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>An up to date survey on the position regarding nursing vacancies is currently being finalised by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, and will be available shortly. I will arrange for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of flexitime, I assume the Deputy is referring to the availability of flexible working arrangements. Nurses are generally employed to work a 39 hour week over a seven day spread, with premium payments for evenings-nights, weekends and public holidays. A variety of work patterns are operated within nursing including a pattern of early, late and night shifts, day on-day off systems, week on-week off systems, and long day patterns where the working week is based on three days and four days on alternate weeks. There are also positions, such as in out-patient departments, where a Monday to Friday pattern operates. A significant number of nurses have been facilitated in working on a job-sharing basis &ndash; the most recent figures indicated 5,000 nurses were availing of such opportunities, which involves working 19.5 hours per week on average.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, following agreement between the HSEA and the health service unions, new measures were introduced to enable staff in the health service to be employed on a permanent basis for any variety of contracted hours above eight hours per week, on average. Thus, staff in the health service, including nurses, may now apply to work a wide range of patterns involving a work commitment of between eight and 39 hours per week. This can also be fulfilled in an agreed number of days working per week.</P>
      <P>The agreement on flexible working in the health service is an imaginative response aimed at meeting both the needs of employers to attract, recruit and retain staff and of individual health service employees who wish to change the balance between their working and personal life commitments. The working options previously available to nursing staff, full-time or job-sharing, were regarded by health service employers and nursing unions alike as inflexible and a significant underlying reason for nurses leaving the public health service and undertaking agency work. The introduction of the new flexible working arrangements has been warmly welcomed by the nursing unions in particular as an important measure to retain nursing staff and to attract nurses and midwives who have left the workforce back into the system.</P>
      <P>The operation of the new arrangements will be closely monitored by the HSEA and the trade unions over the first year of operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department collates information on public hospital in-patient waiting lists on a quarterly basis from data supplied by health agencies. Data on waiting times are collected only in relation to the nine waiting list target specialties. The waiting times for these target specialties show the number of adults waiting for procedures in the following two categories &ndash; those waiting between three and 12 months and those waiting more than 12 months. The waiting times for children are also supplied in two categories &ndash; those waiting between three and six months and those waiting more than six months.</P>
      <P>The number on in-patient hospital waiting lists for target specialties at 31 March 2001 in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area was 12,599. This represents a 18% decrease on the comparable figure of 15,385 for March 2000.</P>
      <P>The number of adults waiting 12 months and more for treatment at hospitals in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area at 31 March 2001 has decreased by 21% and the numbers waiting three to 12 months has decreased by 16% on the comparable figures for March 2000. The number of children waiting between three and six months increased by 4% while the number of children waiting six months and more has decreased by 22%.</P>
      <P>A sum of £8.5 million has been made available to the Eastern Regional Health Authority under the waiting list initiative and a further £4.5 million has also been made available to the authority under the cardiac services waiting list initiative for 2001. I understand that the ERHA has commissioned a number of hospitals to carry out 5,000 procedures under phase 1 of the waiting list initiative 2001, in addition to their core baseline activity.</P>
      <P>Overall hospital waiting list figures have decreased by 23% since March 2000 and it is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined the situation regarding the bed capacity needs in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the allocation of the additional revenue funding of £3 million. This funding is being utilised by the ERHA to fund the early commissioning of 53 additional beds and to support a number of initiatives aimed at improving patient services. I am satisfied this investment will allow for the enhancement of acute hospital services in the eastern region.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he plans to take to deal with the situation identified in the recent study by the Eastern Regional Health Authority which found that more than 60 patients a day are having to wait on trolleys for up to six hours in the casualty departments of Dublin's acute hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of lengthy waiting periods for patients deemed to require admission for acute hospital care and treatment following clinical assessment in the accident and emergency departments of hospitals providing such services in the eastern region was identified in the study referred to by the Deputy. The study found that for the year 2000 the number of patients waiting on trolleys for more that six hours averaged 62 patients per day. The study identified bed capacity as part of the problem and identified a range of internal and external factors which were contributing to delays in discharging patients.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and cannot be predicted accurately in advance. In this regard periods of exceptional demand may be experienced and waiting periods for treatment may vary, particularly during the winter period. However, I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to keep waiting times to an absolute minimum and appropriate medical care is provided to patients at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures which I have taken to improve our accident and emergency services include the provision of a £32 million investment package aimed at alleviating anticipated service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period. The investment package has been targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants. The recruitment of additional consultants to this key area is designed to reduce any unnecessary delays experienced by patients attending accident and emergency departments and to ensure that patients have <Col N="867" /> improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision making service. Additional funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted 761 beds under the initiative and this helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospital.</P>
    <P>I have provided funding to support a range of initiatives at hospitals in the eastern region which are designed to improve patient services. These include funding of £300,000 towards the enhancement of security cover in accident and emergency departments; £5.19 million towards the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital; the provision of minor injuries units in Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St James's and Tallaght Hospitals; development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital and for chest pain management at St. James's Hospital; the provision of a pilot discharge lounge in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks funding of £3 million has also been provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the enhancement of acute hospital services within the region, including the commissioning of 53 additional acute beds and the appointment of patient liaison personnel in eight accident and emergency departments across the region to enhance the existing patient support service.</P>
    <P>I have also requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the structure, operation and staffing of accident and emergency services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. The review, which is now under way, will take into account the report of the Medical Manpower Forum, policies of the Irish Accident and Emergency Association and the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgeons, international best practice, the views of health authorities, management, medical practitioners and other relevant matters. The findings of this review will inform future policy decisions in relation to the development of accident and emergency services. I am satisfied the initiatives I have outlined will help to relieve some of the pressures although I accept there is a need for additional targeted investment to the accident and emergency service to allow for future improvement in services.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings, on foot of the commitment by this Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The bed review, which is at an advanced stage, is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review <Col N="868" /> involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and is specifically examining the need for acute beds on a national basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most <Col N="869" /> in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 allow health boards to exercise their discretion in a number of areas, including, for example, articles 22.3 and 22.4 allows the payment of an amount in excess of the current rate of subvention in some cases. This element of discretion allows health boards to consider each application on its own merits and offers the flexibility necessary to best meet the interests of the applicant.</P>
      <P>In relation to the two specific issues raised by the Deputy, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years and a health board may at the time of registration, or subsequently, impose conditions in relation to registration. The regulations provide for periodic inspections at least once every six months by the health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of the regulations.</P>
      <P>To obtain a rounded and comprehensive view of a nursing home and the standard of care, the home will have to be inspected by professionals of various disciplines such as a public health nurse, medical officer and an environmental health officer. Nonetheless, the exact formation of the inspection teams will be a matter for determination by the chief executive officer or deputy chief executive officer of a health board.</P>
      <P>Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 provides that individuals resident in private nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention from the health board may not be charged extra for any service which is considered to be essential to their maintenance in the home and common practice in most nursing homes. Such services include bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person and incontinence wear.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently in place for the supply of incontinence wear by health boards to medical card holders living in the community. On 26 February, on the instructions of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, a letter was issued to the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority requesting that the boards ensure that medical card holders who have entered, or will enter, private nursing homes, retain their eligibility for incontinence wear under the GMS scheme and that all medical card holders in receipt of a subvention be supplied with incontinence wear on the same basis as if they were residing in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This request has logistical implications for the boards, including assessment and distribution <Col N="870" /> issues. However, I am asking the boards to put the arrangements in place as a matter of urgency. In the meantime, incontinence wear should still be supplied by private nursing home owners as provided for in Article 16.1 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>Services at St. James's Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>The report referred to by the Deputies, which was commissioned by the authority at my request to examine the delivery of accident and emergency services at St. James's Hospital, was prompted by the death of a patient in the accident and emergency department of that hospital who had presented there for care and treatment.</P>
      <P>The report, a copy of which I received in late December 2000 recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, the appointment of patient liaison personnel to the accident and emergency departments of hospitals providing such services, including St. James's Hospital, in order to ensure the presence of a key dedicated individual to facilitate enhanced contact and communication between patients waiting for treatment and medical-nursing staff providing the treatment.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I recently provided additional revenue funding of £3 million to the authority for the enhancement of acute hospital services across the region. This includes funding for the appointment of three patient liaison officers at each of the eight adult accident and emergency departments in hospitals providing such services in the region, including St James's Hospital. The authority anticipates that these appointments will facilitate extended cover in this area beyond the normal working day.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There is an ongoing debate on the use of incineration and other thermal treatments as part of an integrated approach to waste management. I am advised that at present there are no incineration facilities for dealing with municipal waste in operation here.</P>
      <P>The main human health concerns in regard to incineration of waste relate to possibly harmful emissions following incineration and the disposal of possibly toxic residues and ash from the site. Emissions from waste incineration can contain dioxins which are persistent organic pollutants. Dioxins can enter the food chain via grazing animals. Cows milk is monitored here by the EPA to determine dioxin levels. Levels monitored to date have been insignificant in terms of potential human health impact.</P>
      <P>The development of policy on waste management including the use of incineration for refuse disposal is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. I would be concerned to ensure that the implications for public health of decisions in this area are taken into account.</P>
      <P>In general waste management objectives are designed to minimise waste production and to encourage recycling and energy recovery while ensuring safe and nuisance free management and disposal so as to protect public health and safeguard the environment.</P>
      <P>I am advised that there is no preference to date for any particular method of disposal or hard evidence that one method is preferable to another as being less injurious to health. From a human health perspective the principal concern is that whatever method is used should be properly managed, regulated and monitored to minimise pollution and emissions and safeguard public health and the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of hospitals and other health care agencies use the services of recruitment agencies to source nurses from abroad for employment in the Irish health service. A nurse coming to work <Col N="872" /> here under the working visa-work authorisation arrangements is entitled to work anywhere as a nurse in the country. Nurses recruited from abroad enjoy similar conditions to Irish nurses and, like Irish nurses, may undertake agency work if they so wish. However, this is without prejudice to any contractual arrangement that an individual nurse may have entered into with a particular health service employer.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that nurses recruited from abroad by Irish hospitals are being poached by nursing agencies. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will be happy to make further inquiries into the matter.</P>
      <P>In the case of the new hospital at Tallaght, the chief executive officer has advised my Department that there is a minimum transfer of nurses from the hospital to the nursing homes sector. Under a general contract arrangement between the hospital and its recruitment agency, where nurses leave the employment of the hospital before the specified date, the agency must replace the nurses free of fees.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the position is that some nurses recruited from abroad for employment in particular sectors were seeking to transfer to the large acute general hospitals. In this context, the Deputy will be reassured to learn that it is the practice of the Dublin academic teaching hospitals not to offer employment to nurses from abroad while they are still under contract with the health service agencies for whom they were originally recruited.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services to people with sensory disabilities including those who are deaf or hard of hearing and the accountability for funding allocated for the provision of such services is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards may provide services directly themselves or fund a voluntary agency to provide the services on their behalf. The main voluntary service provider currently involved in the provision of health related services to those who are deaf is the National Association for Deaf People. As well as providing funding to support residential services at St Joseph's School for the Deaf in Cabra and St Joseph's House for the Adult Deaf-Blind in Stillorgan, between 1997 and 1999 a total of £1.051 million has been allocated by the health boards for the development of a range of support services specifically for people with sensory disabilities, including rehabilitation and family support services, social work services and psychology services. People with sensory dis<Col N="873" /> abilities may also avail of home support services, day care services and respite services if required.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1999, additional funding of £5 million has been provided to the health boards each year for the provision of aids and appliances for people with physical and sensory disabilities. In identifying and processing waiting lists for such aids and appliances, the health boards consult extensively with the voluntary sector, including agencies providing services to people with sensory disabilities. From this funding, a large number of individuals with sensory disabilities have been provided with the appropriate equipment to enable them to live as independently and to participate as fully as possible within their community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very concerned recently to hear that the Medical Defence Union, MDU, proposed to increase the subscription rate for its consultant <Col N="874" /> obstetrician members in Ireland from £68,665 to £393,000 per annum. I obviously regret that the MDU should have felt it necessary to impose an increase of this magnitude on a relatively small group of its members. I have met the MDU on several occasions in the past year and I am aware of the circumstances which they feel has left them with no alternative but to implement this increase.</P>
      <P>While I am conscious of the anxiety which an increase of this magnitude must have caused to individual MDU members I must emphasise that I did not see it having any impact on obstetrician's capacity to continue in practice. The other provider of medical indemnity cover to Irish doctors, the Medical Protection Society, does not share the pessimistic view taken by the MDU on this issue and is confident that it can offer full cover to obstetricians at a cost of £51,600 per annum. The Medical Protection Society has expressed a willingness to accept applications from obstetrician members of the MDU who wish to transfer.</P>
      <P>In order to tackle the longer term issues in this area a group has been established to look at alternative ways of providing cover for infants who suffer brain damage at birth, including a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme. The group is to hold its first meeting in July and I look forward to receiving its conclusions and recommendations in due course.</P>
      <P>It is planned to change the existing arrangements for the provision of medical indemnity in July 2002 so that individual consultants who work in the public hospital system will not have to provide their own indemnity cover for their public work. This will remove the need for consultants to pay the amounts now being charged for indemnity cover even though the bulk of this cost is borne by the Exchequer by way of a 80 &ndash; 90% reimbursement for those who work in the public sector.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Services (In-Patient) Regulations 1991, a consultant's private patients must ordinarily be accommodated in private or semi-private beds, while consultant's public patients must ordinarily be accommodated in public beds. However, a patient being admitted to hospital as an emergency admission shall be accommodated in whatever bed is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a person is liable for a statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public <Col N="875" /> hospital services. The current charge of £26 in respect of each day during which a person is maintained up to a maximum of £260, is applicable to both public and private patients. In addition, private and semi-private maintenance charges are applicable to private patients accommodated in designated private beds.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991 removed the entitlement to combine public and private elements of in-patient care at the same time. The position now is that every patient is entitled to full public hospital services including public accommodation and public consultant care. Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Where a patient chooses to be a private patient, then he or she is liable for consultant fees even when, for reasons of lack of availability of a private bed, he or she has to, as an emergency admission, occupy a public bed.</P>
    <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant or by obtaining a private bed.</P>
    <P>However, in circumstances where clinical need requires that a patient be accommodated apart from other patients the hospital in question can arrange for such provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxili<Col N="876" /> ary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed and the recruitment of a fourth consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is in train. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and the recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed; two of the managers will commence duty in July and the third will take up duty next August. A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed. The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. Agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics and four dentists will commence training in 2001. Validation of waiting lists is currently in progress.</P>
    <P>The initiative in the ERHA will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting lists to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board's proposals include the development of new orthodontic units in Tralee and North Cork and the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists; both positions were advertised last week. The board also proposes to commission four additional orthodontic chairs in the orthodontic unit in St Finbarr's Hospital and to validate waiting lists. These proposals will double the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce waiting times to under 12 months in the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The proposals from the Midland, Mid-Western, North-Eastern, North-Western, South-Eastern and Western Health boards include the use of private orthodontists, the training of two specialists in orthodontics in the Dublin Dental Hospital to commence in October 2001, and the recruitment of three additional orthodontic specialists, one senior clinical dental surgeon, four dental surgery assistants and three administrative staff. Additional sessions by health board staff and validation of waiting lists are also proposed.</P>
    <P>The impact of the initiative in these health boards will enable an additional 2,500 patients approximately to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> Overall, this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists. The health boards have advised me that the ultimate effect of their proposals when fully implemented, will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>
    <P>The effect of the initiative is becoming evident in the short time of its existence. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the numbers awaiting orthodontic treatment and assessment have been reduced by approximately 800 since the initiative commenced in the board. In addition, the chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that the recruitment of additional clinical staff has allowed treatment to commence or recommence for approximately 1,150 patients since September 2000.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, this initiative &ndash; combined with the structural changes being introduced &ndash; will, I am convinced, secure the delivery of an effective orthodontic service.</P>

      <P>Mental health is equally important as physical health to the overall wellbeing of a person and poor mental health has a significant impact on a person's quality of life and their contribution to society. The strategic aim, set out in the Health Promotion Strategy, 2000-2005, is to promote positive mental health and to contribute to a reduction in the percentage of the population experiencing poor mental health.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has been supporting a number of media based public awareness campaigns which focus on a range of mental health issues. Through funding campaigns run by organisations such as the Mental Health Association, AWARE, Schizophrenia Ireland and GROW, information and greater awareness on mental health matters continues to be promoted among the general public.</P>
      <P>There are also numerous regional initiatives run by the health boards in conjunction with a range of non-statutory organisations focusing on mental health issues. There is increasing importance attached to issues such as stress management, suicide related matters and school based mental health promotion.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to support and continue to support new developments and national awareness programmes and will continue to implement the objectives as set out in the national health promotion strategy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly. I will bring the findings of the study to Government with a view to agreeing an investment strategy for the acute hospital sector.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the national review of bed capacity, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, prepared a comprehensive needs assessment indicating a requirement for 1,276 additional acute beds by 2011 to meet increasing demands. The objective of the ERHA review was to determine whether additional acute beds are required within the eastern region based on good standards of efficiency; population characteristics; and medical-health care developments.</P>
      <P>My Department also invited the ERHA and the health boards to submit proposals on measures which could be put in place in the short-term to bring additional bed capacity into the acute hospital system. In this regard the ERHA recently submitted proposals to my Department which are aimed at increasing bed capacity within the eastern region. The proposals identify potential to increase the acute hospital bed complement in the region by 325 beds and 10 extra day care places up to 2003.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say I have already allocated additional revenue funding of £3 million to the ERHA to support the initiatives proposed. This funding is being utilised by the ERHA to fund the early commissioning of 53 additional beds and to support a number of initiatives aimed at alleviating pressure on accident and emergency departments and improving patient services.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied this investment will allow for the enhancement of acute hospital services in the eastern region. The additional proposals identified by the ERHA are being examined by my Department and will be considered in the context of funding available and other competing demands.</P>

      <P>The benefits of regular activity are well documented. Epidemiological evidence demonstrates that physically inactive adults are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, type 2, osteoporosis, various cancers, obesity, anxiety and depression as well as all causes of mortality. According to the SLÁN National Health and Lifestyle Survey, 1999, 21% of the population take no exercise at all while only 42% of Irish people take physical exercise. Some 24% take mild exercise four times a week for at least twenty minutes. A further 31% take moderate exercise three times per week and 9% do strenuous exercise three times a week. Younger people and women at all ages in the higher socio-economic groups exercise more. It is clear from these figures that many men, young people and older people do not take sufficient exercise to achieve health benefits. The recent North-South Ireland Food Consumption survey carried out by the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance reported that on average people spent 19 hours per week watching television compared with only one hour's vigorous physical activity.</P>
      <P>In 2001 an all-island campaign &lsquo;get a life, get active' was developed which aimed to raise awareness of the need to increase levels of physical activity among the population for increased health enhancement. It is clear that maintaining a healthy heart and body through healthy lifestyles must become part of daily life for all of us. As the strapline suggests, you can get more out of life by being active. The campaign is running on television and radio between June and October this year and support materials are available from health boards around the country. Each health board will also run local initiatives to support the national campaign which will add to the overall impact to the campaign.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that up to half of the beds closed at the end of May 2001 were due to staff shortages; the steps he is taking to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of beds out of use on 24 May 2001 was 125. This is an improvement over the same quarter last year when 351 beds were out of use.</P>
      <P>The figure of 125 beds out of use represents 1% of the number of designated beds in the public acute hospital system, 12,327.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, of the 125 beds out of use, 54 or 43.2% were closed due to nursing shortages, 37 or 29.6% were closed due to ward refurbishment, <Col N="880" /> 28 or 22.4% were closed due to temporary suspension of obstetric services, 4 or 3.2% were closed due to capital works and 2 or 1.6% were closed for unspecified reasons.</P>
    <P>This means that less than one half of one percent of the bed stock available in the public acute hospital system was out of use due to nursing shortages according to the most recent information available to my Department.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Employers Agency undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001. The number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,315. When account is taken of the service of agency nurses, 423 per day, and overtime working, equivalent to 592 nurses per day, the net vacancy situation pertaining at 31 January 2001 stands at 300. The gross number of vacancies reported for the Eastern Regional Health Authority region, excluding the learning disability sector, was 1,148.79.</P>
    <P>The survey shows that a total of 4,226 nurses were recruited in the year ending 31 January 2001 and that a total of 2,954 resigned-retired in the same period. Accordingly, the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,272 nurses in the system. The number of nursing vacancies existing nationally on 30 September 2000 had fallen by 5% by 31 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The HSEA is finalising a survey in respect of the position at the end of April 2001. This survey is expected to show a further improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>A major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, was launched by me in November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. In particular a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</P>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment-retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses: payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; and abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy situation. A total of 1,456 working visas-work authorisations were issued to nurses from non EU countries between June 2000 and May 2001.</P>
    <P>In response to the current shortage of nurses, I increased the number of training places last year <Col N="881" /> by 300, from 1,200 to 1,500. This year a further 40 additional places have been created. It is intended to maintain the annual intakes of nursing students at this level in order to ensure an adequate supply of nurses for our health service into the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to ensuring an adequate supply of nurses and midwives to staff our health service into the future, the Commission on Nursing identified a need to strengthen the workforce planning functions in my Department. In response, my Department set up a Study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource in December 1998. The aim of the project is to analyse the present position with regard to the nursing and midwifery workforce, to devise a system for the projection of future needs and to plan how these needs may be met. The steering group published an interim report in September 2000 and the £5 million recruitment-retention initiative announced by me on 29 November last was my immediate response to recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>The steering group has identified as an urgent priority the refinement of systems and processes used to supply essential information to ensure that forecasts for future nursing and midwifery requirement are feasible and improve over time. Highlighted in the interim report are the inadequacies of existing databases to yield reliable information on which to base forecasts. To address this, work is progressing on the development of a new personnel, payroll, attendance recruitment system, PPARS, that will capture essential data on each individual and post within the health service. The PPARS project is a fundamental building block in developing dependable, reliable and robust quality information to forecast human resource requirements for the health service in the future.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the figures quoted above represent an improvement in the position relating to beds out of use due to nursing shortages.</P>
    <P>In addition, the initiatives I have outlined above represent a very significant effort on behalf of my Department, health boards and hospitals to facilitate the recruitment and retention of nursing staff.</P>

      <P>Operational responsibility for delivery of the primary childhood immunisation programme, including MMR, lies with the individual health boards. My Department also monitors the operation of the programme nationally. I am advised by the National Disease Surveillance Centre that immunisation uptake rates in respect of the MMR vaccine for the years 1999 and 2000 are 77% and 79% respectively.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the increase in uptake in 2000 over 1999, I am concerned that MMR uptake still falls short of the target of 95% which is required to provide herd immunity in the population. Additional funding was provided in 2001 to the health boards to develop strategies to address the uptake problems in the primary childhood immunisation programme on a national basis.</P>
      <P>In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a National Immunisation Steering Committee which is addressing a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes. This includes the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets.</P>
      <P>Concerns have been expressed about an alleged link between the MMR vaccine and the development of certain conditions or disorders. I would like to reiterate that my Department has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied that the MMR vaccine is a very safe and effective one. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism and studies published in the UK and Europe have further confirmed this. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine. Parents should discuss with their general practitioner any concerns they may have before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to urge all parents to immunise their children. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

    <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists and waiting list times. Between March 2000 and March 2001, the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 62%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 36% and the number wait<Col N="884" /> ing for orthopaedic services for more than 12 months decreased by 36%.</P>

These welcome reductions have been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001.

      <P>It is acknowledged that a major factor affecting the ability of acute hospitals to provide beds for patients is the number of beds which are inappropriately occupied by patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. Many of these patients are older people who require a further level of care in a more appropriate setting. In addition, some of these patients will have been admitted to acute hospitals as a result of the lack of alternative residential and community services.</P>
      <P>The contracting of additional places in private nursing homes was identified as an appropriate measure to help reduce the effect of inappropriately placed patients on the acute hospital system. I am pleased to report that over 700 places were contracted in private nursing homes under the winter initiative to address this requirement. In addition, funding was allocated to health agencies to facilitate improved efficiency in the discharge planning function. This was designed to eliminate any avoidable delays in the patient assessment process prior to discharge and transfer to an alternative setting, including nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Articles 4.1 and 4.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, provide that a person must apply for a subvention prior to entering a nursing home and that a person who enters a nursing home prior to making an application cannot apply sooner than two years from the date of admission. Nonetheless, it also provides that this provision may be waived at the discretion of the board's chief executive officer. Furthermore, Article 4.4 provides that a person may also apply for a subvention, following emergency admission to a private nursing home. These provisions can facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals into a more appropriate care setting while allowing their applications to be completed and considered.</P>

Such specialist departments are designed to ensure prompt admission of older patients to hospital, specialist assessment, diagnosis and treatment, rehabilitation and continuing support on discharge where day hospital facilities are available. The availability of adequate assessment, rehabilitation and day hospital facilities for older people is crucial to the provision of timely, accessible, less disruptive acute treatment services for older people and can also reduce significantly the inappropriate use of acute beds. My Department will continue to place high priority on the development of such services.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to <Col N="887" /> develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed; the first has been assigned to the East Coast Area Health Board and the second will take up duty next September in the South-Western Area Health Board; the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is currently in train; two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more; the recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed; two of the managers will commence duty in July 2001 and the third will take up duty in August 2001; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised.</P>
    <P>A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards is being organised; a competition to fill the posts of dental hygienist in the area health boards will commence shortly; the previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St James's Hospital unit has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a locum basis; a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed; the Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital; validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress; agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists from the ERHA will commence training in 2001.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of additional clinical staff has allowed treatment to commence or recommence for approximately 1,150 patients in the ERHA and the initiative in the authority will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that the number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment in their area of responsibility at the end of the March quarter 2001 were as follows:<Col N="888" /></P>

      <P>At the invitation of the Neurological Alliance I recently launched its document, Standards of Care for People with Non Physically Disabling Neurological, and Associated Psychiatric, conditions. This document is the second in a series of three publications produced by the alliance which seeks to address the needs and requirements of fpeople who suffer from a range of neurological conditions.</P>
      <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new therapies for many disorders becoming available.</P>
      <P>Arising from a number of meetings with interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal, to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. The review which is under way has the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle Na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 Comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reports prepared by the Neurological Alliance will assist the review by Comhairle na nOspidéal. I look forward to receiving the report from An Chomhairle which will inform future policy and investment decisions in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Bed day costs, as identified in the national casemix programme of the Department of Health and Children, which collects costs in relation to the cost of treating patients in acute hospitals, involves much more than the actual &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; cost of maintaining patients in hospital. Bed day costs include both the care cost and the full treatment cost associated with individual patient care.</P>
      <P>Costs in acute hospitals are subject to both ordinary inflation, including new legislation in areas such as health and safety, and medical inflation generally, both of which impinge on bed day costs. Medical inflation includes the cost of new drugs, better treatments and new technology. It is accepted that new technology will increase health budgets, even while delivering existing service levels. Medical technology is improving the diagnosis and treatment of illness, and this results in greater patient outcomes, but has cost implications. Increased staffing numbers, necessary for the provision of enhanced patient care, have also contributed to the increase in costs. The changing age profile of the population is also a factor. Modern health care helps people to live longer, but the cost of treating the elderly is significantly higher.</P>
      <P>However, bed day cost on its own is not a meaningful measure of hospital performance. Modern medical practice is increasingly intensive with patients spending less time in hospital and receiving an increasingly more complex, and costly, range of treatments.</P>
      <P>Overall, all the indications are that the Irish health service performs well in international comparison.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall objective of the Government's strategy in relation to drug misuse is to significantly reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus <Col N="890" /> on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. With regard to treatment the objective is to provide a range of options to encourage and enable drug misusers to avail of treatment with the aim of reducing dependency and improving overall health and social well-being, with the ultimate aim of leading a drug-free lifestyle. However, it should be said that becoming drug free is not possible, in the short-term at least, for some individuals.</P>
      <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 which was published in May 2001 by the Taoiseach, is the result of a comprehensive review initiated by my colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, in April 2000. An extensive consultation process was undertaken by the review group. First, submissions were invited, through the national media and by invitation, from interested individuals and groups and approximately 190 submissions were received. This was followed by a series of eight regional consultative fora in June, which were organised to give individuals and groups an opportunity to outline their views on how effective the current strategy is and how it might be improved-adapted. Approximately 600 people attended these fora. In addition, the Minister, Deputy Ryan and the review group met 34 different interested groups. With his officials he also visited Sweden, Australia and Switzerland to see at first hand the drugs strategies of those countries and examined the drugs policies in a number of other countries. Ireland's strategy would have elements of a number of other countries' policies such as Sweden, but it is unique in that the actions and targets identified have been developed in response to Irish needs.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy has been developed around the four pillars of supply, prevention, treatment, including rehabilitation and risk reduction, and research. This approach incorporates, more or less, the full range of activities which are the hallmarks of modern drugs strategies in other jurisdictions. The strategy sets objectives and key performance indicators against which progress may be monitored. 100 individual actions have been identified which the relevant bodies have to carry out in order to implement the strategy and meet its objectives.</P>
      <P>With regard to treatment, both detoxification and methadone maintenance are well recognised treatment options for an individual with a history of drug misuse. It should, however, be pointed out that success rates for detoxification either as an in-patient or as an out-patient are generally less than 20%. Support needs to be given to those who complete withdrawal in order to prevent relapse and it is often difficult for a client to maintain abstinence from drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that there is currently a 17 bed in-patient detoxification unit at Cuan Dara in Cherry Orchard Hospital and a ten bed unit at Beaumont Hospital. A 20 bed downstream detoxification unit in St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, opened <Col N="891" /> earlier this year. This number of beds compares favourably with international standards and guidelines for such facilities which indicate an average of between 0.5 and 1.5 beds per 100,000 of population. In addition, the Eastern Regional Health Authority provides resources for a post detoxification unit operated by the Merchant's Quay Project in High Park, Drumcondra. It also provides funding for a post detoxification rehabilitation unit at Cuan Mhuire in Athy.</P>
    <P>Methadone maintenance is internationally recognised as a valid and successful part of an integrated response to the drug problem. It has also been shown that it is possible to reduce the antisocial behaviour of intravenous drug users by taking them into treatment on methadone maintenance programmes. A report reviewing the services of the then Eastern Health Board which was published in 2000 stated that methadone maintenance is one of the most widely evaluated treatments for opioid dependence worldwide. Internationally, there is a well established research and a clinical evidence-base for substitution treatment with methadone. On average, methadone maintenance is associated with lower rates of heroin consumption, reduced levels of crime and improved social functioning. A lower risk of premature mortality among maintained patients has been reported and substitution programmes have also contributed to the prevention of the spread of HIV infection. The report also found that a number of satellite clinics informally reported rates of 40% plus of those on methadone returning to work. Although it is acknowledged that this may partly be due to the current work climate which exists in Dublin it also states that this high percentage is very striking as evidence of successful social habilitation or rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The authority is continuing to expand its drugs services including the number of detoxification beds available to drug misusers. Other health boards are also keeping the situation under review in order to be able to respond to any drug misuse problems that may emerge.</P>
    <P>Countries all over the world are grappling with the problem of drug misuse. There are no easy solutions but I believe that the implementation of the recommendations of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 will have a positive impact on the drug situation in this country.</P>

      <P>The cost of developing the Coolchoices website was in the region of £40,000. The market research conducted on the site revealed a number of conclusions. The most significant of these was that: the site performs strongly in terms of information, most of which proves appealing to this audience; while many of the myths, quiz questions and story boards echo some of the avowed barriers to drinking, letting parents down, getting caught, horror stories etc., expressed by the audience surveyed, 14-16 year olds, they do require expansion in terms of scientific content, graphic representation, realism and first person narrative accounts relative to teens; the &ldquo;Fun Stuff&rdquo; section seemed impressive from an Internet user point of view but does not actually follow through in terms of generating alternative behaviours to drinking; much of the anecdotal material in &ldquo;Natural Highs&rdquo; would benefit from a more even spread of boys and girls as well as narrative accounts of personal experiences; the site will require an overhaul in several areas of design, notably, appearance, tone of voice and language including the name, interaction and graphic elements and a more adult-seeming addressee profile with serious informational content and links.</P>

      <P>The provision of medical services in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. I understand from the Western Health Board that there is no formal provision for the dispatch of a surgical trauma team to the scene of an accident.

    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> It is proposed to develop the skills of ambulance crews to deal with all accident situations. The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which I established in April 2000, has responsibility for standards, education and training in the field of pre hospital emergency care. The council has submitted proposals to my Department recently in relation to developing advanced care services in the country's ambulance service. The council has recommended that a two stage process be adopted to introduce advanced practice to the ambulance service, that is, a feasibility study of standard operating procedures for advanced practice; an invitation to relevant bodies to submit proposals for training courses.</P>
    <P>The feasibility study is required to explore the clinical, operational and managerial issues arising from the introduction of a new clinical service to the pre-hospital emergency setting.</P>
    <P>The council's submission is being examined by my Department and we will work closely with the council, health boards-authority, training bodies and medical services in ensuring the efficient development of advanced care services to the country's ambulance services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The incidence of AIDS has been steadily decreasing in recent years. This is mainly due to the success rates which are being achieved through the use of the highly effective antiretroviral treatments or triple therapy, which prevents or delays the onset of AIDS in HIV positive patients. The most recent data published by the National Disease Surveillance Centre shows that the total number of AIDS cases declined to 21 cases in 2000 compared to 41 in 1999. This brings the total number of AIDS cases to 707. There were 13 AIDS related deaths reported in 2000 compared with 17 in 1999. This brings the total number of AIDS related deaths to 362. The NDSC which now reports statistics in relation to AIDS will publish a report in the coming weeks on AIDS in Ireland, covering the period 1983-1999.</P>
      <P>The incidence of AIDS in Ireland is relatively low when compared with other countries throughout Europe. The incidence rate per million population in Ireland in 1999 was 6.8 while the incidence rate per million population in the same year in various countries in Europe was Britain, 11.9; Italy, 36.0, Spain, 77.1; and Portugal, 88.3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three major groups affected by transmission category are injecting drug users, IDUs, sex between men, SBM-bisexuals and heterosexuals. All other categories account for approximately 12% of the total number of AIDS cases. The number of AIDS cases in all transmission categories has declined since the mid 1990's and <Col N="894" /> this can be primarily attributed to increased use of HAART, which has delayed disease progression. However, the decline in the number of cases among MSM and IDUs have been higher than among persons exposed through heterosexual contact.</P>
    <P>HIV is now seen as a chronic rather than a fatal illness, however, there is no room for complacency given the recent increase in the reported number of HIV cases. These statistics show that 342 new HIV cases were reported during the year 2000, an increase of 64% over the previous year. Increases were recorded in all at risk groups. The national AIDS strategy committee, NASC, which is chaired by my colleague Minister of State Moffatt published AIDS strategy 2000 in June 2000. This document sets out a number of recommendations for action over the next five years. The committee has three sub-committees, education and prevention, surveillance and care and management. A multi sectoral approach has been adopted by the committee and its sub-committees, which are representative of the main statutory and voluntary agencies working in the HIV-AIDS area. They also include people who are HIV positive. These committees will drive the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the first NASC report significant additional funding has been provided to health boards. As well as providing primary and hospital care for those infected they also fund a range of voluntary agencies involved in HIV-AIDS prevention and care.</P>
    <P>HIV is a preventable illness and education and awareness are the most effective tools in the fight against infection. The links between strategies to combat HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections are important because of STIs being recognised as cofactors in the transmission of HIV. Despite the information available to young people, however, the incidence of all major sexually transmitted infection is increasing and this is obviously of serious concern. The NASC has broadened its remit to cover policy in relation to STIs and it is working on improving the present systems of surveillance and management of these conditions. One of the main messages in education and awareness programmes is that the use of condoms can significantly reduce the risk of infection and transmission.</P>

      <P>The appropriate prescribing of drugs for a patient is, in the first instance, a matter for the clinician. Practitioners are in the best position to decide the correct medication for their patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements for monitoring of medical prescriptions generally include inspections by inspec<Col N="895" /> tors of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and information made available to health boards via the General Medical Services &ndash; Payments &ndash; Board. Where concerns arise in relation to drugs in general, and controlled drugs in particular, referral may be made to the Medical Council or to my Department depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and the regulations made thereunder certain controls are in place regarding the prescribing of controlled drugs. They include controls relating to licensing, possession, administration, supply, record keeping, prescription writing, destruction and safe custody.</P>
    <P>The Acts allow for the setting up of a committee of inquiry, where appropriate, to investigate any suspected case of irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs. The Acts also provide for the issuing of a special direction which would prohibit a medical practitioner from prescribing specified controlled drugs where such a practitioner is found to be irresponsibly prescribing.</P>
    <P>In addition, in accordance with the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council can investigate complaints of misconduct by medical practitioners and, where a<i> prima facia</i> case is found, a fitness to practice inquiry can be established.</P>
    <P>My Department's chief medical officer has communicated a number of times in the past few years with general practitioners, concerning the need to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs and my Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that such prescribing continues to be carried out in a reasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>I am aware of allegations that benzodiazepines have been prescribed inappropriately. In this regard I set up a committee last June, whose terms of reference are to examine the current prescribing and use of benzodiazepines, to consider recommendations on good prescribing and dispensing practice, paying particular attention to the management of drug misusers, and to make recommendations as appropriate. I expect this committee to report to me in the coming months.</P>
    <P>On 19 June 2001 I launched the report A Strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland &ndash; SARI &ndash; which was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre. The report makes recommendations, among others, for implementing programmes to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. Work in this area is continuing.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the vast majority of practitioners prescribe in a rational and responsible manner. Where this may not be the case I am satisfied that measures in place are adequate to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of screening and preventive services generally in respect of a range of conditions, including diabetes, is one which will be considered in the context of the forthcoming review of general practitioner services and primary care. In addition, diabetes will be looked at in the context of the proposed pilot programme for secondary prevention of cardio vascular disease as diabetes is one of the associated risk factors.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives in respect of diabetes are currently being undertaken by the various health boards, including the following:</P>
      <P>Eastern Regional Health Authority: the 2001 service plan includes a commitment to review the structure and process of care for adult patients with diabetes mellitus within its area of responsibility. A task force has been established to carry out the review, under the headings mortality; morbidity; prevalence and outcomes, which will detail the burden of illness and service provision within the region. It is anticipated that the report of the group will form the basis of an effective strategy approach to the management of diabetes mellitus.</P>
      <P>Midland Health Board: a diabetes project has been in place for three years under which the board has been supporting a number of general practitioners to provide a higher level of care to diabetes suffers in the community and so reduce the incidence of repeat hospital visits. This support includes the services of a community nutritionist and an ophthalmic physician. The board plans to extend the scope of the project to almost one quarter of the general practitioners in the board, by the end of 2001. Other progress has been made in the areas of specially trained diabetes nurses and enhanced awareness by all clinicians.</P>
      <P>Mid-Western Health Board: a diabetic register is in the process of being set up which will, over time, provide more accurate data in relation to the incidence and prevalence of diabetes. It is the boards opinion that general practitioners are well placed to screen appropriate patients for diabetes and good practice would indicate screening for diabetes in certain instances, for example, as part of determination of risk factors post myocardial infarction or stroke.</P>
      <P>North-Eastern Health Board: passive screening is available for early detection and treatment of diabetes. The acute hospitals have open access to a diabetic centre five days a week and each newly diagnosed patient receives ten hours education on diabetes milletus. Some diabetic nurses provide voluntary screening as an exercise in health promotion. Consultant led diabetic clinics have support staff including non consultant hospital doctors, clinical nurse specialists, chiropodists and dieticians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>North-Western Health Board: a diabetic <Col N="898" /> register is being established to enhanced the quality of care for known diabetics. In addition a great deal of opportunistic testing for diabetes is carried out by both general practitioners and by hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>South-Eastern Health Board: a pilot scheme for secondary prevention of cardio vascular disease is under way among those who have suffered a heart attack or who have undergone heart surgery as diabetes is one of the associated risk factors.</P>
    <P>Southern Health Board: a multi-professional group has been established to examine the development of integrated care pathways for patients with diabetes.</P>
    <P>Western Health Board: an existing register indicates a prevalence of diabetes of 1.4% as of October, 1999.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he will deal with the Ombudsman's report regarding nursing homes, with particular reference to the recommendation that all medical card holders should be entitled to full-time care in either private or public nursing homes.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the recent expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily <Col N="899" /> as possible. However, as you can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving,<i> inter alia,</i> difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Persons who hold medical cards are entitled to a wide range of services free of charge, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    <P>Persons in receipt of long stay or extended care may be charged under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987, or under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965. The former regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges. The practice has been that, persons in health board long stay care have not usually held medical cards as the board meets the cost of all of the person's health needs and, thus, the person ceases to qualify for a medical card in accordance with criteria laid down in section 45 of the Health Act, 1970. With regard to the extension of medical cards to over 70s, my Department is examining the implications of this with a view to ensuring an equitable situation is in place in relation to the application of charges in respect of long stay or extended care.</P>
    <P>Under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, charges are made where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
    <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department and is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is currently no proposal from the Department of Finance to exclude private patients from public hospitals. The Finance Act, 2001, includes measures which allow for the establishment of private hospital facilities under certain conditions which include provisions to ensure that 20% of the capacity of such facilities would be made available annually for the treatment of persons <Col N="902" /> who have been awaiting in-patient or out-patient services as public patients subject to service requirements specified by the health board in whose area the facility is located.</P>
      <P>The private hospital concerned must provide a discount of at least 10% to the State in respect of fees to be charged in regard to the treatment of any such public patients as compared to the fees charged in respect of similar treatment afforded to a person who has private health insurance. The intention of these measures is also that the benefits in terms of additional beds should be captured for the public system by the redesignation as public of an equivalent number of beds in the public system that had been designated as private. The aim of this is to reduce pressure on public hospital beds.</P>
      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Private patients are liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants fees in addition to the statutory charges.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Act also provides that beds in public hospitals are formally designated as public, private or non-designated. The Health Service (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, which were introduced pursuant to the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, state that a hospital providing services under section 52 and 55 of the Health Act, 1970, shall designate every bed, other than non-designated beds as a designated public bed or a designated private bed. The category non-designated beds refers to beds such as intensive care beds which it was not considered appropriate to designate as public or private. In its report published late last year, Private Practice in Irish Public Hospitals, the ESRI found that about 20% of in-patient beds in acute public hospitals are currently designated as being for private patient use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report shows that, of the total number of public bed days used, approximately 6% were used by private patients and that about 23% of all in-patient bed-days spent by private patients in public hospitals were in beds designated as public. In addition, the report also shows that there is a crossover of slightly lower absolute volume in the other direction, that is of public patients into private beds. The authors suggest that improvements to the reporting and monitoring of the arrangements could be piloted in hospitals where &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; is most prevalent. The report states that the main factor identified by hospital management as leading to private patients being accommodated in public beds was admission through accident and emergency departments. This largely reflects the need to accommodate patients in the most appropriate available bed irrespective of its designation. The <Col N="903" /> public private mix in public hospitals is under continual assessment by my Department to ensure that the best possible service is available to all patients but particularly the public patient. This assessment includes monitoring of the bed designation system whereby the approval of the Minister for Health and Children must be obtained by public agencies for any increase in the designation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I have initiated a study of bed capacity in response to commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This study is examining both acute and non-acute bed numbers and will deal with issues relating to bed numbers throughout the public system.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I am currently preparing a new national health strategy for submission to the Government. The new strategy will be informed by a number of recent studies such as the bed capacity review and the value for money audit.</P>

Phase one of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and the North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards. &ldquo;BreastCheck&rdquo; have informed me that, up to 20 June 2001 a total of 41,630 women have been invited for screening, including 2,814 women from the Midland Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Screening is currently available to all women living in the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area and the North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards aged between 50 and 64 with calls for screening being done on a random basis by &ldquo;BreastCheck&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>General practitioners in the screening areas provide self-registration leaflets to their patients or supply &ldquo;BreastCheck&ldquo;'s freephone number to enable women ascertain if they are on the &ldquo;BreastCheck&rdquo; register.</P>
      <P>Based on the 1996 Census, it is estimated that there are approximately 140,000 eligible women living within the phase one area of the programme. Given the number already called for screening, there are approximately 100,000 women still to be called to participate in phase one.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of my Department that phase two of the programme, which will involve the extension of &ldquo;BreastCheck&rdquo; nation-wide, should follow phase one as soon as is practicably possible. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by International Quality Assurance criteria and best practice.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to expand the membership of the commission to facilitate its investigation into the vaccines report and the appointment of an additional member is currently the subject of consultation between the commission and the Department of Education and Science, on behalf of the Government. Once the commission's membership is expanded, a division of the investigation committee, to deal with the vaccines trials report, can be established. That division of the investigation committee will then be empowered by the combined operation of section 11(6) of the commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 and the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001, to inquire into the vaccines report, to make determinations, to prepare a report and to furnish the report to the commission which will then be published.</P>

    <P>Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £74.57 million was allocated from 1997 to 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists and waiting times. Between March 2000 and March 2001, the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 62%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 36%, and the number waiting for orthopaedic services for more than 12 months decreased by 36%.</P>
    <P>During the same period, the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by 78%, the number waiting for general surgery for more than six months decreased by 16%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 50% and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 29%. These welcome reductions have been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no adult waits longer than 12 months and that no child waits longer than six months for treatment. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment.</P>

      <P>The capital programme for the health services under the national development plan, NDP, represents a major initiative by the Government to radically improve the infrastructure of our service. My Department has overall strategic responsibility for the NDP so as to develop the health service infrastructure in a co-ordinated and effective manner. However, the prioritisation and delivery of individual capital projects at local level is primarily a matter for the health boards.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 billion was provided at the launch of the plan for the health service nationally for the period 2000-2006. As 2000 was the first year of the NDP for the health services, transitional arrangements applied in relation to capital funding for health boards to ensure that existing commitments were met while allowing scope for various new approvals throughout the country. In relation to 2001-2006, capital funding was indicated to health boards for each of those years for various care programmes such as disability services, child care, acute hospitals, etc. The actual funding available each year to individual health boards will depend on a number of factors, including adjustments in respect of various issues such as inflation, changing service priorities, technological developments, new clinical practices, progress on the delivery of specific projects and market capacity in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Health boards have developed plans under the NDP for the years 2001-2006 in line with the indicative funding levels notified to them by my Department at the commencement of the plan. The health board plans are expected to evolve over the period of the plan in line with prevailing service, financial and operational circumstances. It is therefore not possible at this stage to project the progress on individual projects proposed under the NDP.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120, £150 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase, and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. As referred to above, Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)(No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, <Col N="911" /> bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an Expenditure Review of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the course of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Work on the preparation of a new medical practitioners Act is currently under way. This process has involved extensive consultations with interested parties and I expect to be in a position to bring forward draft heads of the Bill later this year. The functioning of the Medical Council's Fitness to Practice Committee will be addressed in the new legislation.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council has made significant progress towards the introduction of competency standards for Irish doctors. The council has recently appointed a Director of Competence Assurance. He will work with the Medical Council, the professional training bodies and an external reviewer in drawing up a structure which is scheduled to come into force in the next few years. A structure is needed because it is clearly important that doctors are able to demonstrate that competence is maintained, particularly to the public. I understand that the detail will be developed in close consultation with the key stakeholders, including doctors and their representatives, and they will be engaged in both a formal and informal way in developing the competency assessment structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently commissioned a review of the competence assurance law in jurisdictions comparable to Ireland and the potential implications of the Freedom of Information Act upon this process. This review is currently with my Department and therefore not available for publication in its <Col N="912" /> original form until its function of informing the drafting of heads of the Bill for the new Medical Practitioners' Act has been discharged. The report includes an overview of the need for competence assurance, the obstacles and opportunities afforded by the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 and the legislative measures enacted both in Australia and the United States to protect doctors who are either undergoing or overseeing the competence assurance process.</P>
    <P>It has proved readily possible in countries with legal traditions and Freedom of Information legislation analogous to Ireland's to introduce effective statutes enabling competence assurance to accommodate the broad and specific concerns of doctors and patients regarding confidentiality and legal privilege.</P>

      <P>The Government has noted the recommendations of the Report of the Forum on Medical Manpower in relation to a consultant-delivered public hospital service and will consider these proposals again in the light of the results obtained from a costing study on the matter which is to be undertaken by a national task force on medical manpower, the establishment of which has been approved by the Government. The Government has also approved the commencement of negotiations with the relevant parties on core issues arising from the report, including flexibility/cover arrangements, teamworking, etc.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Forum on Medical Manpower sets out proposals for the re-structuring of the medical workforce both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service. The next stage is to quantify the costs, following which the Government will reconsider the proposals. A detailed quantification of the resource implications will now be undertaken. This assessment will form part of the functions of the national task force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of health and safety in the workplace is one which I consider to be of the highest importance. As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for health and safety in the workplace lies with my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through the Health and Safety Authority, HSA. I fully support the work of the HSA both in its advisory role in relation to health and safety issues and in the enforcement of health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>As far as health and safety in the health service is concerned, as set out in the HSA's annual report for 2000, there were no fatalities in the health and social work sector. Notwithstanding this, I am continuing to take measures to reduce risks to health and safety and create a safer environment for all those working in the health service.</P>
      <P>In 2000 each health board was asked to submit details of a review of their security arrangements in their accident and emergency units. Following this review I provided an additional £1 million to further strengthen security in these units.</P>
      <P>In February 2001 I met with the HSA to discuss health and safety issues in the health service and welcomed their plans to step up their ongoing programme of review of health and safety in the health sector. Subsequently, I wrote to the chief executive officer of each health board, reminding them of their obligation to minimise and effectively manage all risks to the health and safety of their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 2001 the Report of the Advisory Committee on Health Services was launched. This is a detailed and comprehensive report encompassing all aspects of health and safety in the health sector including the critical issue of occupational health and safety. The advisory committee's <Col N="914" /> report which highlights the importance of creating a safety culture within health service organisations will provide the primary basis for my plans to continue to seek to protect and enhance the health and safety of all those working in the health service.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services to people with acquired brain injuries is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance and all additional funding made available for the development of such services is provided to the authority and the health boards to allocate on a priority basis, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and service users are represented on these co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>Individuals with an acquired brain injury form part of a larger client group, known as the &ldquo;Young Chronic Sick&rdquo;. The need to provide care and rehabilitation services to deliver on-going therapeutic programmes to the young chronic sick on discharge from acute hospital care or medical rehabilitation and specialised units to provide constant nursing care for individuals with severe acquired brain injury have been identified as a priority service for development.</P>
      <P>Just over £92 million is being provided under the national development plan for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities over the years 2001-06, including the development of a rehabilitation and long-term care service for people with acquired brain injury.</P>
      <P>The need for additional rehabilitation beds has been identified in the review of bed capacity. This review is at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future. I accept that there is a need to provide facilities which can meet the needs of patients requiring access to rehabilitation services. These include selected groups with specific conditions, such as acquired brain injury, who require continuing care in a setting appropriate to their needs.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority informs me that the filling of posts in a number of particular grades is as follows:</P>
      <P>Psychologist &ndash; the current complement of psychologists in St. Joseph's in intellectual disability service is one senior psychologist and one basic grade psychologist. These posts are currently vacant due to the two post holders taking up appointments elsewhere in the public services. The posts have been advertised and interviews have been held under the auspices of the Local Appointments Commission, and the recommendation of the commission is awaited.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority's Provider Plan, 2001 identifies an additional basic grade psychologist for St. Joseph's service and arrangements are in train to advertise this post also through the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapist &ndash; ongoing efforts to recruit a physiotherapist for St. Joseph's Service even on a part-time or sessional basis have been unsuccessful to date and these efforts are continuing. In the meantime urgent physiotherapy treatments for residents of St. Joseph's Services are provided in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>The authority's Provider Plan, 2001 provides for recruitment of an additional post of physiotherapist for St. Joseph's services.</P>
      <P>Speech therapist &ndash; St. Joseph's service currently has the services of a speech therapist on a half time basis. The authority's Provider Plan, 2001 provides for the appointment of a senior speech and language therapist in the current year.</P>
      <P>Social worker &ndash; there is currently no social worker attached to St. Joseph's service. Up to now the authority's community psychiatric nurses have been providing a similar service. The authority's Provider Plan, 2001 provides for the recruitment of a senior social worker for St. Joseph's service in the current year.</P>
      <P>In relation to staff recruitment generally, St. Joseph's service are experiencing ongoing difficulties in the recruitment of para-medical staff including occupational therapists in addition to the grades mentioned above. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tara, unit H, is a unit in St. Joseph's services accommodating up to 18 residents with a profound disability. Over the past several months this unit has been extensively refurbished and re-equipped at a total cost of £120,000. The refurbishments have been carried out to a high standard. The frosted glass on the lower section of the windows in the day room was provided sev<Col N="916" /> eral years ago at the request of unit nursing staff to protect the privacy and dignity of the residents in Tara. The dayroom fronts on to a public access area with passers-by including delivery and other transport vehicles. While curtains are provided on the windows they are liable to be pulled down frequently due to the challenging behaviour of some of the residents. Accordingly it is felt that the continuing use of the frosted glass in these particular windows is necessary for the residents' privacy. The residents are due to return to the unit later this week, having been relocated to alternative accommodation to facilitate the refurbishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Charges can be made under two sets of regulations in respect of long-stay or extended care. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.</P>
      <P>The practice has been that persons in health board long stay care have not usually held medical cards as the board meets the cost of all of the person's health needs and, thus, the person ceases to qualify for a medical card in accordance with criteria laid down in section 45 of the Health Act, 1970. With regard to the extension of medical cards to over 70s my Department is examining the implications of this with a view to ensuring an equitable situation is in place in relation to the application of charges in respect of long stay or extended care.</P>
      <P>Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965 where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individ<Col N="917" /> ual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>
    <P>In addition, the whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department and is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients was introduced in August 1992. It provides guidelines for good standards of practice in acute hospitals, including maternity hospitals. Although the charter has no statutory basis, its objective is to ensure that the health service is responsive to the needs of the individual patient and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the scheduling of appointments, section 2 of the charter states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have the right, when your family doctor refers you to hospital for an out-patient appointment, to: receive confirmation within a <Col N="918" /> reasonable time of the date of your first appointment; be given an individual appointment time; be seen by a consultant or senior doctor on your first appointment.</P>
    <P>You have the right, should your appointment at an out-patient department be cancelled by the hospital, to receive adequate and timely notice of such cancellation and to be given a new appointment on a priority basis.</P>
    <P>The patients' charter was an important step in developing awareness of patients' rights and I intend to develop a comprehensive policy which will build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides. I acknowledge that there is a need to develop a more people centred service across the health system and it is my intention that this will be a central theme in the new health strategy. Finally, I am aware that there are capacity issues surrounding the provision of gynaecology services and I am committed to addressing this issue in the context of decisions to be taken in relation to bed capacity in the acute hospital sector.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give an outline of his comments at the SIPTU Nursing Conference on 21 May 2001.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19340/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the pleasure of addressing the SIPTU Nursing Conference in Galway on 21 May 2001. I am making arrangements to have a copy of my speech sent directly to the Deputy. In the meantime, I am happy to have this opportunity to summarise its contents; implementation of the report of the commission on nursing; the first section of the speech referred to progress in implementing the report of the commission on nursing and drew attention to the first annual report of the monitoring committee overseeing the implementation of the recommendations which was circulated in January 2001. As proof of its commitment to the implementation of the commission on nursing report, this Government has provided £22 million to fund initiatives under the action plan for 2000 and 2001. The monitoring committee has agreed a new action plan for 2002 and 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then outlined developments since the very important report of the nursing education forum was launched by me on 24 January 2001; an interdepartmental steering committee was set up to deal with all policy and funding issues and has met on a number of occasions since its first meeting on the 15 March 2001; direct discussions between representatives of third level institutions and the nursing unions in relation to the assimilation of nurse teachers into the third level sector were facilitated by my Department. I was directly involved in leading these discussions to a successful conclusion. I indicated that a very good deal had been brokered for nurse teachers and that I was hopeful that it would be accepted. This deal was accepted subsequently; a national implemen<Col N="921" /> tation committee to monitor progress in the implementation of the proposed nursing degree programme across the country met for the first time on 11 April 2001 and is proceeding with its work.</P>
    <P>I referred to the major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, which I launched in November 2000. As part of the overall recruitment-retention strategy the following financial supports for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses have been introduced; payment of fees to nurses/midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>I referred to the increase in the number of nursing training places to 1,500 until at least 2003. Since 1999 there have been record intakes to nursing training, particularly in the psychiatric and mental handicap programmes. This record increase is the direct result of a concerted recruitment campaign, both at national and local level, which was funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>Details were given of the improved the package of financial and other supports available to nursing students from 1 June 2001. The full year cost of these enhancements is in the region of £1 million.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Mental Health Bill, 1999, was outlined and an update on progress was given. I referred to the enormous strides which continue to be made in developing a service which is comprehensive, community-based and integrated with other health services. I then outlined the additional funding provided this year, £18.64 million, for improvements in mental health services and the priority areas for development.</P>
    <P>I also outlined proposals for substantial capital funding under the national development plan. Approximately £150 million in capital will be provided over the lifetime of the plan for the mental health services. At the end of the period of the national development plan in 2006, it is my intention to have made substantial progress on completing the programme of acute psychiatric units. I will also provide funding under the national development plan for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences, thus further accelerating the phasing out of the old mental institutions.</P>
    <P>I informed the delegates about two important strategy documents being developed by the nursing policy division in my Department: (i) strategy document on nursing in the community, (ii) a research strategy for nursing and midwifery in Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the review of the Nurses' Act, <Col N="922" /> 1985, I indicated that I expected to be in a position to seek Government approval for the heads of a Bill by the autumn. I informed the delegates that a working group is being established to review the practice of patient escorts in the context of the future development of mental health services and, in particular, the provisions of the mental health Bill and to make recommendations in relation to future practice.</P>
    <P>I outlined my thoughts on the development of the new health strategy under the headings of consultation, principles, key themes, and existing initiatives-service developments. Following my address, I accepted an invitation to participate in a question and answer session which covered a wide range of issues.</P>

      <P>A national review of bed capacity, in both the acute and non-acute sectors is being conducted on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is primarily focused on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms to meet the needs of the population. The review is nearing completion and the findings will be submitted to Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>When I launched the Saint Vincent de Paul's report on health inequalities and poverty, recently, I acknowledged the important role which they have played in our society for many years in drawing to the attention of the public and the administrators and politicians some of the inequities which persist in our society. I welcome the report for its contribution to the complex area of health and social exclusion, an area that this Government has particularly focused on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As commented on by the society in its report, the 1999 annual report of the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Chil<Col N="923" /> dren drew attention to the fact that &ldquo;inequalities in health status between socio-economic groups in this country have been demonstrated and are persisting&rdquo; and that the factors involved in the relationship between ill health and socio-economic background are complex and hard to unravel. However, we know that poverty can lead to ill health and in turn ill health can lead to poverty.</P>
    <P>In 1998, my Department commissioned the first national representative survey of lifestyle practices, the national health and lifestyle surveys, to provide baseline data to plan future interventions. This research reached similar conclusions as the health strategy. The data forms the basis of my Department's new health promotion strategy for the years 2000 to 2005. This has specific strategic aims and objectives that will contribute to reducing health inequalities.</P>
    <P>Many of the causal factors of health inequalities, such as poverty and unemployment, are outside the direct control of the health services. Inter-sectoral collaboration is required to tackle these problems. The Cabinet committee on social inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach, includes Ministers from eight relevant Departments who meet regularly. Also, the NAPS interdepartmental group provides the principal strategic focus for the national anti poverty strategy, NAPS. This strategy was published in 1997 and set out a programme to reduce poverty and social exclusion both in general and in a number of key policy areas. Substantial progress has been made in achieving the original targets.</P>
    <P>As part of its commitment to tackling social exclusion, the Government gave a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review the national anti-poverty strategy across all relevant Government Departments, and to develop NAPS targets in the health area with an associated monitoring and implementation framework. That exercise is now being carried out by the Institute of Public Health in consultation with the social partners under the auspices of a working group on NAPS and health established by my Department. A final report is expected this summer.</P>
    <P>With the assistance of the Institute of Public Health, the working group is trying to ensure that the consultation process is as inclusive as possible so that people who are poor or socially excluded have a genuine opportunity to tell us what they think would improve their health situation. To avoid duplication, this consultation is being co-ordinated with that for the national health strategy, with the same liaison officers co-ordinating both processes at health board level. The results of the NAPS and health consultation will be one of the important elements feeding into the new national health strategy.</P>
    <P>The new national health strategy is now being prepared to address the major issues still facing the health system. Building on the previous strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, the new strat<Col N="924" /> egy will outline the proposed development in the health system for the next five to seven years in regard to improving our nation's health status. The overall objective of the strategy will be to provide a timely, safe and quality patient centred service on the basis of need.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that in keeping with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operations of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>
    <P>A sustained and strategic programme of public investment, coupled with appropriate and effective programmes of care, are essential building blocks for a high quality health system. For this reason, the dual approach of significant funding backed by a series of reforming strategies has been the hallmark of this Government's commitment to the health services. The overall budget for health services for 2001 is now over £5 billion, representing a doubling of exchequer input since 1997. On 1 January 2001 there were 1,560 consultant posts in the public sector in Ireland as compared to 1,292 posts in 1997, a net increase of 268 posts. There have been significant advances in many programmes. Last year over 70,000 more day cases and almost 12,500 more in-patient cases were dealt with in our hospitals than were dealt with in 1997. These 82,500 extra cases were dealt with as a result of increased funding and a series of effective initiatives in the health system.</P>
    <P>A further example of substantial investment is the allocation of over £60 million under the national cancer strategy since 1997. In addition, significant increases in revenue funding for services for older people from £10 million in 1997 to £57.5 million in 2001 have resulted so far in approximately 880 new staff, 400 additional beds and 1000 new day care places.</P>
    <P>In addition, a total of £2 billion was made available to the Department of Health and Children at the launch of the national development plan in January 2000 for the period 2000-06. The plan will bring positive benefits to all sections of the health services. It will, for example, enable substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure and equipping of acute hospitals, and in facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, older persons, mental health and child care. The plan also provides for much needed investment in other areas such as new health centres and in the important area of information technology. The thrust of the plan is to create an infrastructure on a regional basis, that will bring significant advances in delivering a more patient-centred and accessible service.</P>
    <P>Much work has already been done in Ireland on a multi-sectoral approach to poverty and social inclusion. It is essential that we continue to build and improve on the framework in place in <Col N="925" /> the context of revised NAPS targets, NDP funding, and the commitments contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in the provision of orthodontic services. These difficulties are being addressed and progress is being made on a number of fronts to increase the numbers in treatment.</P>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran Report, review of orthodontic services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. One of the review group's recommendations was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. An accord has been reached between the Dental Council, the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork and the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry to establish specialist dental training in this country on a sound footing. The Dublin Dental Hospital, Trinity College, and health boards have advertised a specialist training programme in orthodontics. The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics and the issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is currently being negotiated under the auspices of the health services employer's agency.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the setting up of a specialist register and the creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health board service will result in a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service.</P>
      <P>I have also approached the Dental Council concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics &ndash; this grade will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling greater caseloads to be achieved.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> The Eastern Regional Health Authority has appointed two additional consultant orthodontists and the recruitment of a fourth consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is in train.</P>
    <P>A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed. The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is developing new orthodontic units in Tralee and north Cork and the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists for the board is in train.</P>
    <P>Based on the health board's own submissions, I expect this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The health boards have advised that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>

      <P>Medical experience suggests that persons suffering from personality disorder are at the extreme end of normal human variation. These extreme traits of personality disorder are not symptoms of an illness which can be treated and cured. It is therefore considered that personality disorder may not be legitimately viewed as an illness.</P>
      <P>There is no clear evidence to indicate that the most appropriate method of providing services to persons with personality disorder or with anti-social behaviour is through the provision of a dedicated service.

      <P>The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991, provide that, employees in continuous service with the same employer for at least 13 weeks and who are normally expected to work at least eight hours a week are entitled to a minimum period of notice before the employer may dismiss them. In this context, a person with ten months service would be entitled to one week's notice.</P>
      <P>In general, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 1993, protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs and provide redress for employees who have been found to be unfairly dismissed. To qualify under these Acts, an employee is normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and have at least one year's continuous service.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the details supplied in this case, as the length of service is ten months, that the person concerned would not qualify under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. However, if she feels that she has been unfairly dismissed, she may refer the matter to a rights commissioner of the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. A rights commissioner investigation is, however, voluntary and requires the consent of both parties.</P>

      <P>Proposals with regard to the mainstreaming of community employment, schools services are being finalised and I intend to begin the mainstreaming process and to transfer CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to the Department of Education and Science in time for the new school year in September next.</P>
      <P>A limited number of supervisors are engaged solely in schools related projects and may become redundant over time as a direct result of the mainstreaming of schools services. In general, the number of supervisors required on the CE programme will reduce in line with the reductions in participation levels on the programme.</P>
      <P>Where possible, supervisors who may be affected by the mainstreaming of schools services will be accommodated on other projects as vacancies arise. In addition, some social economy projects are likely to be in a position to offer employment when they are fully operational. It is also important to note that supervisors are continually leaving the programme to avail of the opportunities that present themselves in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>My Department has met groups of supervisors and their tradesunion representatives to discuss their concerns around the mainstreaming of CE services and we will continue to update key stakeholders on developments.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the purpose of mobility management plans, which aims to encourage and support more sustainable travel patterns among staff, clients and other visitors to organisations. The employer's guide to mobility management plans produced by the Dublin Transportation Office in conjunction with Kirklees Metropolitan Council and the Irish <Col N="929" /> Energy Centre provides a useful template for all employers. The guide acknowledges that a mobility management plan may take the form of a formally published document or may simply evolve over time as different initiatives are piloted and that either approach is appropriate. A number of initiatives have been put in place or are planned in my Department which support sustainable travel patterns among staff. Well located cycle parking facilities are provided as are changing and shower facilities for cyclists, flexible working hours are available to most staff which promotes a staggered pattern of staff arrivals and departures and thus contributes to reducing congestion, it is proposed to extend flexible working time bands with the introduction of new management software. Arrangements are in train for the introduction of teleworking to be run initially on a pilot basis. The use of public transport and a Department taxi account for business travel in Dublin reduces the need for staff to travel to work by car and thus contributes to reducing congestion. The approved norm for domestic business travel for staff is public transport where available. Use of private cars is permitted only where it can be justified in the public interest.</P>

The Shannon board is of the opinion that the river has excellent potential for tourism and recreational angling and recognises that the various public and private sector stakeholders all have a role to play in achieving the potential of the river. I would ask any local stakeholders with proposals for the catchment area of the river to contact the chief executive officer of the Shannon board.</P>

This US-based company, Evergreen Resources, intends to submit an application for an onshore exploration licence <Col N="932" /> over an area in the Northwest Carboniferous Basin comprising lands in counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo.

      <P>There is no differentiation between the terms for offshore and onshore petroleum exploration licences. Offshore petroleum exploration licences are granted in accordance with the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development, 1992, and the same terms would also apply, where appropriate, in the case of any onshore petroleum exploration licences granted. The fiscal terms dealing with taxation, royalties and write-offs are covered by the provisions of the Finance Act, 1992, as amended, introduced by the Minister for Finance. As such they are part of taxation legislation and apply to all licensees, and are not negotiated on a case by case basis.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the provision of a new airport at Oranamore, County Galway; the progress in moving the project forward; the financial assistance which was provided by her Department towards the development of Carnmore Airport in the past three years and in 2001; if there is a plan for the future development of air transport to Galway; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding any proposal to develop a new airport for Galway is a matter for the promoters and sponsors of any such proposal. I have received no proposal regarding a new airport at Oranmore, Co. Galway.</P>
      <P>The long standing policy of my Department as regards the development of aviation facilities is that private interests may provide and develop airports in whatever location they wish, provided the requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority are met and planning permission is secured. It is a matter for the promoters of any such development to satisfy themselves that an airport can function as a viable commercial entity.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 1998 I allocated a grant of £3.1 million to Galway Airport for a project to extend and widen the existing runway. This project has experienced a number of delays in connection with the planning process and in acquiring all of the necessary lands required for the runway extension. However, the airport authorities secured planning permission from An Bord Pleanála in April of this year and I understand the process of acquiring two remaining parcels of land is currently in train. All going well, it is anticipated that this project should be completed in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, over the four years of the 1996-99 marketing scheme, Galway Airport received a sum of £40,000 per annum to support their marketing and promotional activities. A substantially <Col N="935" /> increased sum of £125,000 was made available to Galway Airport under this scheme last year.</P>
    <P>A further provision of £1.5 million has been made available for the regional airports in my Department's Estimates this year for marketing, safety and security measures at the regional airports. The precise extent of the funding to be allocated to the airports individually is currently under consideration in my Department and I expect to be in a position to decide on the allocations in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government has also provided a significant sum of £11 million under the national development plan for the regional airports under the seaports-airports sub-programme. Prior to Easter this year, my Department invited proposals from the regional airports and these proposals, including those from the Galway Airport authorities, are now being considered with a view to prioritising investment needs over the plan period.</P>
    <P>As regards air transport to Galway, I increased substantially the frequency of the Galway-Dublin PSO service under the new contract with Aer Arann Express, which began in January of this year. The new frequency is 28 return flights per week compared with 21 previously, and the route is operated with a 50 seater pressurised aircraft. This increased frequency will further facilitate tourists and business people alike to access Galway and Dublin rapidly. Also, when the runway extension project is complete, the airport authorities at Galway hope to attract direct air services to other destinations.</P>

However, after comparing both rail and bus options for commuter services the consultants recommended that the public transport strategy for the study area should be bus-based.</P>
      <P>The study, which was completed in 1999, is currently under review and my Department is represented on the review group. The issue of a commuter rail service from Athenry to Galway may arise in the course of the review and if it does my Department will examine the case on its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 111, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Railway Safety Programme 1999 to 2003, was agreed by Government in March 1999. It provides for an investment totalling £430.6 million over the five years of the programme, comprising £379.4 million for infrastructural safety works and £51.2 million for improvements to the safety management systems of Iarnród Éireann. The investment on infrastructural works includes £32.2 million for the renewal of some 110 bridges and the repainting of 500 bridges across the network over the life of the programme. In relation to the arch at Islandeady, the safety of this arch is the responsibility of Iarnród Éireann and not one in which I have a function. However, I understand from Iarnród Éireann that, although the arch has a very low clearance, it is not considered to pose a risk to the railway and was not therefore included by them in the bridge renewal element of the railway safety programme. However, the company has advised me that in the light of local concerns about the access restrictions imposed by height restriction of the arch discussions are ongoing at present between Iarnród Éireann and Mayo County Council to try and resolve these concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety programme includes provision for the completion of other improvement works on the Castlebar to Westport railway line by the end of 2003, in particular, the renewal of the track, the upgrading of some bridges and level cross<Col N="938" /> ings, and other ancillary work such as fencing and embankments. The total cost of the works on the Castlebar to Westport line under the safety programme is estimated to be in the region of £10 million.</P>
    <P>The chief railway inspecting officer of my Department monitors matters relating to railway safety and is in constant communication with Iarnród Éireann regarding specific issues. He has advised me that he has not inspected the arch at Islandeady but that he has visited the Castlebar to Westport line to inspect a number of level crossings.</P>
    <P>I have conveyed the concerns of the Deputy regarding the arch at Islandeady to the chief railway inspecting officer and I have asked that an inspection of the arch be conducted.</P>

      <P>The function of the Dublin Transportation Office, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Environment and Local Government, is to advise the Government on transport strategic planning and to monitor and co-ordinate implementation of those plans in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>As I stated in a recent Parliamentary Question, No. 68 of 20 June, 2001, copy attached, individual decisions about particular rail stops on existing suburban lines are a matter for Iarnród Éireann who is required to operate its services as efficiently as possible within the annual subvention provided by the Exchequer. The Dublin Transportation Office's Strategy, A Platform for Change, includes a rail stop at Ballyfermot. The Luas line between Tallaght and the city centre planned for 2003 will service part of Ballyfermot. Furthermore, the DTO Strategy recommends a Luas line from Lucan to Docklands via Ballyfermot to be constructed in the period between 2006 and 2010. This would interchange with the suburban rail line at Ballyfermot.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid his full entitlement of £2,800.41 under the 2000 suckler cow scheme, on 27 June 2001. No applications under the 2000 sheep headage scheme, equine headage scheme and goat headage scheme were received from the person named. He was paid £297.28 under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 7 March 2001, after overpayments under the 1999 extensification scheme and the 2000 ewe premium scheme amounting to £1,661.72 were offset from the total due.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium on 15 animals in November 2000. Payment was delayed due to an area aid over-declaration issue that has recently been resolved. Payment of £1345.12 has issued today in respect of special beef premium for 14 animals. Premium was not paid in respect of the one remaining animal as it did not meet the age criteria at the time of application.</P>
      <P>Eligibility under the slaughter premium 2000 scheme, has been established in respect of six animals, three of which were beef breed heifers entitled to the national envelope top-up. After overpayment amounts have been offset from the total due, £122.67 for slaughter premium and £56.23 for national envelope, payments of £20.63 slaughter premium and £13.03 national envelope have issued.</P>
      <P>The person named cannot be considered for payment of 2000 extensification premium as he failed to return form CEN.2 relating to the fourth and fifth census dates of Sunday, 24 September and Sunday, 19 November 2000.</P>

      <P>I understand that the mobility management plans referred to in the Deputy's question were the subject of letters to a wide range of individuals and organisations around the end of May. Mobility management plans form part of the DTO's strategy to promote measures aimed at managing transport demand. These plans cover a range of approaches and they will vary in detail from organisation to organisation. Fundamentally, however, mobility management plans aim to assist staff to change their approach to travel in a way that reduces overall transport pressures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Areas that can feature in mobility management <Col N="943" /> plans include car pooling, cycle parking-shower facilities, walk-links to public transport nodes, flexitime arrangements and teleworking schemes for employees. My Department has already acted in a number of these areas in the context of improving conditions generally for employees and consideration will be given to the feasibility of further initiatives in the context of the DTO's initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provide for notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where deficiencies in services are identified <Col N="944" /> during inspection, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The timescale for making improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months, exceptionally, a longer period may be allowed. The Deputy will appreciate that, having regard to my responsibilities, the health, safety and welfare of children must be my primary consideration.</P>
    <P>The progress of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's equal opportunities child care programme is confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care supply in Ireland. Since the announcement of the availability of funding in April 2000, in excess of £40 million has been provided to over 470 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sector. To date, over 14,000 child care places will be supported by this funding which will ensure both the continuation of existing places and the creation of almost 6,000 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. In addition funding of over £10 million has been approved for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, innovative projects, local child care training models, the &ldquo;childminders initiative&rdquo; and supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. This brings the total amount allocated under the equal opportunities child care programme to over £50 million to date.</P>
    <P>The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda and show that this Government is delivering on its commitment to treat child care as a priority area for investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the funding of services at Beaumont and the Mater Hospitals rests with Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to outline for the Deputy the considerable capital investment which this Government is making at Beaumont and the Mater Hospitals. Capital projects approved and at various stages of implementation at both sites are as follows; in March 2000 I announced my approval for major replacement equipment and refurbishment works at Beaumont Hospital. This is the first time that Beaumont Hospital has had such a programme since it opened in 1987. The total amount of investment will be £26.469 million over four years and is being funded by the national development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding for major equipment will be in excess of £9 million while over £17 million will be <Col N="946" /> available for extensive refurbishment work. The equipment replacement programme will cover; theatres, diagnostic imaging, laboratory, CSSD, accident and emergency, endoscopy, out-patients', ophthalmology, neurology, general wards, mortuary, medical records and health and safety. These departments were identified by the hospital as requiring priority equipping investment. The refurbishment programme will include: equipment replacement, upgrading of clinics, recladding and reroofing of hospital and major upgrading of the reception area.</P>
    <P>Planning is also under way to upgrade the renal dialysis unit at the hospital. The hospital has recently advertised for a design team to advance the project.</P>
    <P>Funding in the region of £180 million, October 1999 prices, has been identified in the national development plan for the redevelopment of the Mater campus to include expanded and improved facilities for the existing Mater Hospital and the building of a new children's hospital, replacing the Children's Hospital at Temple Street. The development provides for an additional 80 beds over the existing bed complement.</P>
    <P>The design brief has been completed and approved by my Department and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The main clinical areas to be provided in the development are; accident and emergency department, out-patient day care and ambulatory care facilities, operating theatres, including day surgery, sterile supplies, heart-lung transplant facilities, ITU-HDU pathology, diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, a new children's hospital and physical medicine.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that these extensive projects outlined above will contribute significantly to improved patient care for the population of Dublin's northside.</P>

    <P>Practice support allowances in the form of grants for secretarial or practice nurses are also based on the number of GMS patients on a doctor's panel. They range from £18,000 for a practice nurse with one year's experience to £22,000 for a practice nurse with three year's practice nurse experience. In the case of the practice secretary, the allowance varies from £12,000 for a secretary with one year's relevant experience to £14,000 for a person with three year's relevant experience. These rates are not intended to be the basis of the salary paid to the individuals involved. Their salaries are a matter of contract between the doctor, as the employer, and his or her employee and are, therefore, not within my remit. On average, each GMS general practitioner receives a payment of £74,700 from the GMS Payments Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support for people with a severe disability who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings &ndash; for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance has been increased to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April 2001. People benefiting from both the mobility allowance and the disabled driver's and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme can retain the mobility allowance at the former rate of up to a maximum of £45.60 per month. To be eligible to receive mobility allowance, applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years, be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution, be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous, inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year, moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons, be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether <Col N="949" /> the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility. Further information about mobility allowance, including an application form, can be obtained from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Community Care Area 4, Old County Road, Dublin 12.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax concessions) Regulations, 1994, which were drawn up by the Minister for Finance and come under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. Persons with a severe and permanent disability who use a specially adapted motor vehicle as drivers or passengers, and who meet the prescribed conditions, are entitled to claim the following; exemptions from motor tax and refund-exemption from vehicle registration tax, refund of VAT, refund of duty paid on petrol-diesel, subject to a maximum of 600 gallons per year.</P>
    <P>To qualify, a person must meet the medical criteria specified in the above regulations. The senior area medical officer for the relevant health board area will issue a primary medical certificate if he or she is satisfied that the applicant fulfils the medical criteria set out in the Department of Finance's Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations.</P>
    <P>Further information about the scheme can be obtained from the Disabled Drivers Section, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Coolshanagh, Monaghan, County Monaghan, telephone No: 047-82800.</P>

      <P>Infectious diseases are notifiable to the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, under the provisions of the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, and subsequent amendments. As asbestosis is not an infectious disease the question of making it statutorily notifiable does not arise. I am not aware of any EU regulations in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>Food complaints which are reported to the health boards are investigated as a matter of routine. The resulting investigation can often include a laboratory analysis of the food sample by a public analyst or microbiologist. Complainants are informed of the results of the investigation, including the results of any laboratory test. Should a complainant require a copy of the certificate of analysis, an administrative charge of £75 is imposed.</P>
      <P>In 1989 my Department conducted a review of the procedures operated by health boards when dealing with food complaints and found that procedures varied from area to area, giving rise to difficulties. In the circumstances it was decided to introduce a uniform procedure for dealing with complaints from the public about unfit food and £75 was deemed to be an appropriate fee for the laboratory report. The fee has not been revised since 1989 and I think that it would be reasonable to expect given inflation since that date, and considering the charges imposed by private sector laboratories, that any review of the current £75 fee would result in an increase.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the imposition of this charge does not act as a disincentive to prospective complainants as the fee only arises when a copy of the certificate of analysis is required. In such circumstances the person generally intends to take a civil action in respect of the purchase of unfit food and in this regard a fee of £75 for a laboratory analysis and certificate is not considered excessive.</P>

It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report and the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily. I am advised by the six health boards concerned that the amounts repaid are as follows:</P>

    <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, the issue of making payments will be a complex exercise involving <i>inter alia</i> difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34.5 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

      <P>The Deputy requested that I consult with the VHI as to the reason members are not covered for bone density scans. Inquiries have been made of the VHI regarding its determination in relation to this matter and it has provided the following information.</P>
      <P>The VHI considered the issue of insurance cover for bone densitometry in August of 1995. At that time, as is still the case, bone densitometry was used both in screening for osteoporosis and in the management of patients with established osteoporosis. With regard to use for screening, coverage was, and is excluded under the VHI's rules. A review of the literature at that time also identified that the cost effectiveness of bone densitometry as a diagnostic procedure and for the management of patients with established osteoporosis had not been established.</P>
      <P>The VHI has further advised that the issue has been reviewed in 1998, 1999 and again in 2000. On each occasion an updated review of the literature was carried out and the VHI's conclusion was that the cost effectiveness of bone densitometry had not been clearly proven. The VHI's conclusion is that, as there is insufficient and unclear evidence as to the cost effectiveness of bone densitometry for particular population groups, it has not included the charges associated with it as eligible benefits. If further evidence becomes available to support the overall cost effectiveness of bone densitometry the VHI would consider in future its inclusion in any proposed new product for primary care.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>Services for eligible patients at Naas General Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Naas has a 95 bed acute general hospital which also has 13 observation beds attached to its accident and emergency department. Capital funding of £45 million is being provided under the national development plan to meet the cost of phase 2 of the major redevelopment of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On completion of phase 2, the hospital bed <Col N="956" /> complement will increase to 189 beds, including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the acute psychiatric unit provided under phase 1.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the authority that the development works are approximately 19 weeks behind schedule. I understand that this delay has arisen due to inclement weather over the winter period, staff resourcing difficulties and industrial action by building workers. The precise number of man days lost due to the latter has not yet been quantified. I would like to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to bring the project back on schedule. I would also like to assure him that substantial high quality interim temporary accommodation has been put in place, following consultation with staff, to facilitate the development works.</P>
    <P>I am aware that staff at the hospital recently engaged in an unofficial protest to highlight overcrowding conditions at Naas General Hospital. I am confident that hospital management and staff will continue to work together to respond to any difficulties presenting and to ensure that a high quality service continues to be provided to patients in the best working conditions possible, pending the completion of the major development works which I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in the provision of orthodontic services. These difficulties are being addressed and progress is being made on a number of fronts in order to increase the numbers in treatment.</P>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. One of the review group's recommendations was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. An accord has been reached between the Dental Council, the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork and the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry to establish specialist dental training in this country on a sound footing. The Dublin Dental Hospital, Trinity College and health boards have advertised a specialist training programme in orthodontics. The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics and the issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is currently being negotiated under the auspices of the Health Services Employers Agency.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the setting up of a specialist register and the creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health board service will result in a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service. I have also approached the Dental Council concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics &ndash; this grade will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling greater caseloads to be achieved.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has appointed two additional consultant orthodontists and the recruitment of a fourth consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is in train. A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed. The Northern Area Health Board is <Col N="958" /> currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. The Southern Health Board is developing new orthodontic units in Tralee and North Cork and the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists for the board is in train.</P>
    <P>Based on the health boards own submissions, I expect that this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The health boards have advised that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority has informed me that there are 1,594 children in County Kildare currently on the waiting list for orthodontic assessment-treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>Age-standardised mortality rates for EU countries are provided by the World Health Organisation and the last year for which an EU average rate is available is 1997. Table 1 below sets out the rates per 100,000 population for Ischaemic heart disease. Despite significant declines in recent years, mortality rates for heart disease remain high in Ireland compared to the EU average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts, was launched in July 1999. That report, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to implement the strategy in a planned and structured manner over a five year period. As a measure of the Government's commitment to the implementation of this report, structures were put in place at national, regional and local level to <Col N="959" /> drive the implementation process. The Department of Health and Children has set a medium term objective to bring our levels of premature <Col N="960" /> deaths from heart disease in line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide information on the incidence of cancer in Ireland over the past 12 months as requested. The nature of the cancer registration process is such that statistics cannot be issued in respect of any given year until adequate time is given to allow all cases diagnosed in that year to be registered. This information is made available by the National Cancer Registry Ireland in its report entitled Cancer in Ireland, Incidence and Mortality. The most recent year of such a report is 1997 and it is hoped that the 1998 report will be published in the near future.</P>
      <P>As I have previously explained to the Deputy on foot of his previous parliamentary question dated 4 April 2001 on this matter, comparisons between this country and other European countries are mainly based on the EUCAN database of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a branch of the WHO, which gives estimates of cancer for all EU countries. The most recent year for which European age standardised incidence rates are available for all EU member states is 1995 and detailed analyses of these figures are given in annual reports of the National Cancer Registry.</P>
      <P>I have already sent the Deputy tables giving the total number of estimated cases for each EU country for 1995, the number of cases per 100,000 population, the number of cases per 100,000 population, adjusted for age, the rank of each EU country within the EU and the national rate as a percentage of the EU average. The data show that cancer incidence in Ireland for the major cancers is 3% above the EU average, is highest in Europe for colorectal cancer &ndash; large bowel, 24% above average for breast cancer, 15% above average for prostate cancer and close to the average for lung cancer. Variations in the occurrence of cancers between member states may relate to variations in health behaviours such as cigarette smoking, dietary factors, alcohol consumption, as well as genetic and racial factors. It is vital that our focus is both on the prevention of cancer where possible and on early and appropriate intervention for those who develop cancer. My Department, through the implementation of the health promotion strategy, is attempting to reduce the impact of adverse health behaviours. My Department is also implementing the national cancer strategy and other strategies which have arisen from it such as the symptomatic breast disease services report which provides for high quality services through centres of excellence for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</P>

This leaves 45 &ndash; 1.4% &ndash; of NCHD posts remaining to be filled. There is no evidence to indicate that certain specialties are experiencing particular difficulties. I am not aware of any particular difficulties in filling hospital consultant posts.</P>
      <P>The Medical Manpower Forum was established to examine and address medical staffing difficulties. The Government has noted the recommendations of the report of this forum in relation to a consultant-delivered public hospital service and will consider these proposals again in the light of the results obtained from a costing study on the matter which is to be undertaken by a national task force on medical manpower, the establishment of which has been approved by the Government. The Government has also approved the commencement of negotiations with the relevant parties on core issues arising from the report, including flexibility-cover arrangements, teamworking etc.</P>
      <P>The report of the Forum on Medical Manpower sets out proposals for the re-structuring of the medical workforce both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service. The next stage is to quantify the costs, following which the Government will reconsider the proposals. A detailed quantification of the resource implications will now be undertaken. This assessment will form part of the functions of the national task force.</P>
      <P>With regard to nursing vacancies the Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; undertook a survey on 31 January 2001. The survey found that shortages are largely a difficulty in the greater Dublin area. The total number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,315. When account is taken of the service of agency nurses &ndash; 423 per day &ndash; and overtime working, equivalent to 592 nurses per day, the net vacancy situation pertaining at 31 January 2001 stands at 300. The number of nursing vacancies existing nationally on 30 September 2000 had fallen by 5% by 31 January 2001. The HSEA is finalising a survey in respect of the position at the end of April 2001. This survey is expected to show a further improvement in the position. Particular difficulty is being experienced in certain specialist areas including midwifery. I took this into account when announcing a major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million on 29 November 2000.</P>
      <P>A new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment-retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial <Col N="964" /> support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses: payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses/midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>In response to the current shortage of nurses, I increased the number of training places last year by 300, from 1,200 to 1,500. This year a further 40 additional places have been created, bringing to 1,540 the total available nationally. It is intended to maintain the annual intakes of nursing students at this level to ensure an adequate supply of nurses for our health service into the future.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing identified a need to strengthen the workforce planning functions in my Department. In response, my Department set up a study of the nursing and midwifery resource in December 1998. The aim of the project is to analyse the present position with regard to the nursing and midwifery workforce, to devise a system for the projection of future needs and to plan how these needs may be met. The steering group published an interim report in September 2000, and the £5 million recruitment-retention initiative announced by me on 29 November last was my immediate response to recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>The steering group has identified as an urgent priority the refinement of systems and processes used to supply essential information to ensure that forecasts for future nursing and midwifery requirement are feasible and improve over time. Highlighted in the interim report are the inadequacies of existing databases to yield reliable information on which to base forecasts. To address this, work is progressing on the development of a new personnel, payroll, attendance recruitment system &ndash; PPARS &ndash; that will capture essential data on each individual and post within the health service. The PPARS project is a fundamental building block in developing dependable, reliable and robust quality information to forecast human resource requirements for the health service in the future.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the steps he is taking to address the issues which arise from an increase in insurance cover limits from £68,665 to £393,000 for obstetricians.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very concerned recently to hear that the Medical Defence Union proposed to increase the subscription rate for its consultant obstetrician members in Ireland from £68,665 to £393,000 per annum. I obviously regret that the MDU should have felt it necessary to impose an increase of this magnitude on a relatively small group of its members. I have met the MDU on several occasions in the past year and I am aware of the circumstances which they feel has left them with no alternative but to implement this increase.</P>
      <P>While I am conscious of the anxiety which an increase of this magnitude must have caused to individual MDU members I must emphasise that I did not see it having any impact on obstetricians' capacity to continue in practice. The other provider of medical indemnity cover to Irish doctors, the Medical Protection Society, does not share the pessimistic view taken by the MDU on this issue and is confident that it can offer full cover to obstetricians at a cost of £51,600 per annum. The Medical Protection Society has expressed a willingness to accept applications from obstetrician members of the MDU who wish to transfer.</P>
      <P>To tackle the longer-term issues in this area a group has been established to look at alternative ways of providing cover for infants who suffer brain damage at birth, including a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme. The group is to hold its first meeting in July and I look forward to receiving its conclusions and recommendations in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is planned to change the existing arrangements for the provision of medical indemnity in July 2002 so that individual consultants who work in the public hospital system will not have to provide their own indemnity cover for their public work. This will remove the need for consultants to pay the amounts now being charged for indemnity cover even though the bulk of this cost is <Col N="966" /> borne by the Exchequer by way of an 80%/ 90% reimbursement for those who work in the public sector.</P>

The main outcome of the research project was the publication by the Dublin Transportation Office in March this year of The Route to Sustainable Commuting: An Employers' Guide to Mobility Management Plans. I am arranging to have a copy of the guide placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The employers' guide is intended to assist organisations to identify and implement measures to reduce demands on the car for staff commuting and other work related journeys. The guide, together with the information accumulated as a result of participation in the research project, is under consideration in my Department with a view to the development of a mobility management plan as part of a formal environmental management system for the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The students summer jobs scheme is in operation this year until 30 September. The scheme is targeted at students from low income families who are participating in third level courses and who, under existing legislation, cannot apply for unemployment assistance during the summer months.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the scheme students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to the means test applied to unemployment assistance payments. This ensures that access to the scheme is available only to students who come from low income families. For the purpose of assessing the weekly means of a student, the gross income of the student's parents is taken into consideration. Allowances are made for Income Tax, PRSI contributions, superannuation, health Insurance and union contributions, mortgage/rent and travel to employment.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to alter the means limit for the scheme as this would contravene the primary aim which is to help those students who need support most. In keeping with this objective and to give extra help to less well off students, I have decided that this year an additional £1 per hour will be paid to those students whose parents are dependent on social welfare payments. This will allow them to earn an extra £200 if they work the maximum number of hours allowed under the scheme giving them a total payment of £800 for 200 hours work.</P>
      <P>In addition, and in recognition of the special difficulties such students may experience when looking for summer work, I have also extended the scope of this years scheme to approved students who are in receipt of disability allowance or blind persons pension.</P>

      <P>I would like to emphasise that designation of a site does not necessarily require the curtailment of traditional maritime or agricultural activities. Indeed, the survival of these vulnerable habitats is testament to the sustainable nature of the activities traditionally conducted there. On that basis I have no hesitation in supporting their continuance. I would, however, ask that anyone who wishes to engage in the harvesting of seaweed in special areas of conservation (SACs) should first consult with their local Dúchas office. This is particularly important where equipment such as tractor-borne machinery is used as damage may arise in some cases. Each case needs to be assessed individually but in most cases there should be no difficulty <Col N="971" /> in approving particular activities that are part of traditional seaweed harvesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. A sum of £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over <Col N="973" /> the course of the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. This, as I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge, represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>The funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is being promoted as the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-06 and is targeted at services which offer daycare facilities and services for pre-school children and school-going children out of school hours. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>On 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for community based-not for profit child care organisations. Capital grants for small scale self-employed/private providers catering for no more than 20 children were also made available for the first time. In October 2000, I was pleased to announce that capital grants are now available to private providers who cater for more than 20 children. Grants are also available for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, child care training and innovative projects. Applications for funding under these and other measures can be made by submitting the relevant application form to my Department's equal opportunities child care section.</P>
      <P>Applications are assessed according to the following five criteria: the socio economic profile of the area relating to the application; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant/s to implement the project; the level of integration-co-ordination; the costings-value for money of the proposal.</P>
      <P>The progress of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme is confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care supply in Ireland. Since the announcement of the availability of funding in April 2000, I have committed funding in excess of £40 million to over 470 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sector. To date, over 14,000 child care places will be supported by this funding which will ensure both the continuation of existing places and the creation of almost 6,000 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. In addition, I have approved funding of over £10 million for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, innovative projects, local child care training models, the childminders Initiative and supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. This brings the total amount allocated under the equal opportunities child care programme to over £50 million to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures in place reaffirm this Govern<Col N="974" /> ment's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda and show that this Government is delivering on its commitment to treat child care as a priority area for investment. I am satisfied that my Department is making this vital investment in an effective and strategic manner and that the equal opportunities child care programme of my Department is making a real difference to the families of Ireland. The funding measures of the equal opportunities child care programme build on existing structures and will be further developed over the course of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will I am sure understand that I can only grant aid eligible projects that submit completed application forms and that the speed upon which new places can be created depends on the date of the submission of the completed form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is open to self-employed/private providers to apply for a capital grant under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 which is operated by my Department. A sum of £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital grants currently available under the equal opportunities childcare programme were developed in line with the recommendations of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000. Under the programme, capital grants of up to £40,000 were made available in April 2000 for the first time for self-employed / private child care providers who cater for no more than 20 children at any one time for the purchase, building, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities and for the purchase of child care equipment. The schemes in place are kept under constant review. For <Col N="975" /> example, I announced in October, 2000 that capital grants of up to £40,000 would be provided for larger private child care providers for the purchase, building or renovation of child care facilities and for the purchase of child care equipment. Budget 2000 also provided for improvements to the capital allowances in relation to the costs of construction, refurbishment or extension of premises.</P>
    <P>To date, I have allocated funding of £2,549,699 to 113 self employed child care providers catering for no more than 20 children at any one time at an average grant rate of £22,564 per applicant. In addition, I have allocated funding of £607,030 to 21 larger private providers at an average grant rate of £28,906 per applicant. I am satisfied that the current grant level is meeting the requirements of self-employed/private child care providers.</P>
    <P>While there is no staffing grants scheme for private child care providers under the equal opportunities child care programme operated by my Department, employment grants of up to a maximum of £5,000 are available through the city and county enterprise boards, to private child care providers who take on new child care workers. In October 2000, I announced details of the Government's £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care which included a £1 million allocation to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for this purpose. I have been advised by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that information to hand indicates that £540,183 in grant aid has been approved for 97 such applications throughout the country. These grants have the potential to create 163 full-time and 30 part-time jobs.</P>
    <P>The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

With regard to the Deputy's second question, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda is aware of one instance where a former resident of an institution was advised that it would be necessary to allege sexual misconduct to secure compensation. The matter was investigated and a file was submitted to the DPP, arising from the fact that an alleged malicious complaint had been made.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the purpose of mobility management plans, which is to encourage and support more sustainable travel patterns among staff, clients and other visitors to organisations. The employer's guide to mobility management plans produced by the Dublin Transportation Office in conjunction with Kirkless Metropolitan Council and the Irish Energy Centre provides a useful template for all employers. The guide acknowledges that a mobility management plan may take the form of a formally published document or may simply evolve over time as different initiatives are piloted and that either approach is appropriate. A number of initiatives are in place in my Department which support sustainable travel patterns among staff as follows: well located cycle parking facilities and changing and shower facilities for cyclists are available; flexible working hours are available to most staff which promote a staggered pattern of staff arrivals and departures; use of public transport and a Departmental taxi account for business travel in Dublin reduces the need for staff to travel to work by car. The approved norm for local business travel for staff is public transport where available. Use of private cars is permitted only where it can be justified in the public interest, eg. where no suitable public transport is available.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
    <P>Under the criteria, tuition fees will be paid in respect of EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to a third level course.

    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> While teachers in the vocational sector are not currently required to have a general teaching qualification, in practice, the majority of teachers now entering the sector have a professional qualification.</P>
    <P>The question of standardising the requirements for appointment as a teacher in the second level sector generally is one which should appropriately be considered by the Teaching Council when it is established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue described by the Deputy arises out of situations where two schools, one of which is a voluntary secondary school established by a <Col N="981" /> religious order, agree to merge and come under the auspices of their local VEC. In such situations, a memorandum of agreement is prepared, whereby both the VEC and religious order agree the terms for the future operation of the school. This normally involves representatives of the religious order concerned taking a position on the board of management of the school.</P>
      <P>There has to date been no explicit provision made for such religious orders to have representatives on the full VEC. The members of each VEC &ndash; typically 14, with provision for increased membership where the vocational area concerned includes urban district councils &ndash; are currently appointed by the appropriate local authority. At least five and not more than eight such members must be drawn from the local authority. The remaining members are selected by the local authority on the basis of their interest and experience in education and on any recommendations made by local employers. It is therefore at the discretion of the relevant local authority, in constituting the VEC, to invite a representative of the religious order to become a member of the VEC. Such an appointment can be made under the terms of section 8 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
      <P>During the course of the recent Committee Stage debate on the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000, in this House, I undertook to examine the issue of the representation of religious trustees of community colleges on vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>I have now proposed a change to this position. The Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000, as passed by this House, proposes a revised structure for the formation of vocational education committees, maintaining a right of representation for local authorities, but also including representation for parents and staff of the VEC. In addition, the local authority will now, following consultation with the parents and staff representatives, also select a further four members to be represented on the VEC. These members will be selected from among representatives of the wider community served by the VEC. In making such appointments, the local authority must consider the position of trustees of community colleges maintained by that VEC.</P>
      <P>I consider this to be an important enhancement of the existing VEC structures. Where local communities consider it desirable that there be a reorganisation of local education provision, legislation should, where possible, support them in that goal. In recognising the role of trustees of community colleges and the contribution they can make to VEC, this amendment will help to facilitate any existing or future plans for such reorganisations.</P>
      <P>The Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000 is currently being considered in the other House. I expect the Bill will be enacted before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>My Department's inspectorate, in October 2000, assessed this pupil's need for resource teaching support following an application from the school in which she is enrolled. Following consideration of this application, the school authorities were notified that the pupil in question did not meet with my Department's criteria for resource teaching under circular 8/99 but that she should continue to receive support from the remedial teacher who serves the school.</P>
      <P>The school authorities requested a review of my Department's decision in May 2001. This review has now been completed and the school authorities were recently notified that the initial decision has been upheld. I have been informed that the pupil in question continues to receive support from the remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The school may re-apply for support for this pupil in the event of additional professional reports concerning her educational needs being made available to my Department's inspectorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 to 203, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The procedure envisaged under the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, is that an applicant for an award will be required either orally or in writing to inform the Redress Board of the nature and extent of the abuse which he or she allegedly suffered in an institution. Unless the board has reason to believe that the account is untrue, the applicant will be referred for medical and-or psychiatric assessment. It is on the basis of that assessment and confirmation from the professionals concerned that the injury which an applicant displays is consistent with his or her account of abuse that an award will be made. It is not proposed to inquire in detail into the facts of abuse as alleged, other than to establish the identity of the applicant and the fact that he or she was resident in the institution claimed at the time claimed. The board will make a preliminary decision on the basis of the evidence of the claimant as to whether or not to refer him or her for assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this approach is to provide for an informal, non-adversarial and speedy resolution of an application as an alternative to the formal procedures of a court. The carrying out of the kind of detailed inquiries, which would be <Col N="984" /> necessary to reach a definitive conclusion on the facts of an allegation, would be very time consuming, costly and in many cases because of the passage of time ultimately inconclusive. The approach proposed focuses on objectively and professionally establishing the extent to which a person suffers from injury which is consistent with abuse in childhood. It is an approach which could be described as victim friendly and which avoids the very threatening and, for some, traumatic process of detailed inquiry into the facts of the abuse.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is scope within this approach for false or exaggerated claims. There is such scope in any process, even the criminal process. The approach which the Bill adopts is, I believe, a reasonable balance between the need to establish with reasonable certainty that a person is entitled to an award and avoiding a rigorous inquiry process which would prove unnecessarily traumatic for many former victims of abuse.</P>
    <P>While addressing the issue of exaggerated claims, it is worth noting that there is also scope within the process for the making of exaggerated expenses claims by legal representatives of applicants. This is so because effectively three sets of proceedings arise from the same facts proceedings in court, before the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Redress Board. In devising provisions for the payment of legal expenses of applicants, I will ensure that there can be no duplication of claims.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the instances which the Deputy refers to, although my Department is aware of some anecdotal evidence to that effect. I have asked my Department, on foot of the Deputy's questions, to make formal inquiries with the Garda on this matter. If indeed it is the case that such activities are occurring then it will ultimately be a matter for the gardai to make inquiries and conduct prosecutions if there is sufficient evidence. As regards the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, it provides for penalties for people who make false statements to the board.</P>
