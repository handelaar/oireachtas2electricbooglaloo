      <P>Will the Taoiseach offer any explanation or justification for the Department of Health and Children spending £600,000 to sponsor the Irish Masters Snooker Tournament at a time when people are waiting for months and years for operations? That money alone could pay for 350 cataract operations and take people out of suffering and near total blindness. Will the Taoiseach indicate what understanding his Government has of the needs of people when it can spend this money on something like this? If money is to be spent on snooker it could be distributed to small clubs throughout the country to provide people with recreational activity in their leisure time. Instead of seeking an independent sponsor for a tournament of this kind the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, wants to secure soft publicity. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, must be cross that his Department is not getting it. Will the Taoiseach explain where £600,000 can be found to sponsor this tournament when so many people are waiting for life saving operations, yet the health services cannot deliver that kind of service?</P>

      <P>For many years the Irish Masters Snooker Tournament has been sponsored by <Col N="786" /> a cigarette company. This has been strongly objected to by members of the public who are anti-smoking and wish to promote healthy living. Minister Owen knows&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement by the Minister for Health and Children will involve health expenditure of £200,000 per year over the next three years. This money is being provided from existing funds earmarked for health promotion and anti-tobacco initiatives by the Department. The money is part of the initiatives already in place for anti-tobacco promotion in the health promotion unit and the Office of Tobacco Control. The other sponsor, Citywest, will host the tournament next March.</P>
      <P>Health sponsorship of this prestigious international event, which has an enormous audience, will heighten the public profile of the health agencies involved and will strengthen the anti-smoking message we have been trying to follow for a long time. The extensive television coverage of this major sports tournament involves many snooker stars who are well known throughout the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The message is consistent with Government approved policy on tobacco and health which was launched in the report, Towards a Tobacco Free Society. I understand Deputy Allen was especially in favour of the report, yet he does not want to do anything about implementing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to implementing the policy. I make no apologies for it. Rather than talking about trying to do something to deal with the number of people smoking, the enormous numbers dying from smoking related illnesses and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds on trying to save their health when they have already got cancer, we are now spending £600,000 over the next three years to do something positive. Thank God we have reached the day where we have done something positive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what efforts were made to have this prestigious event sponsored by a private company not associated with smoking? I would have no problem with that. The Taoiseach is trying to hide behind the excuse that action was taken because a tobacco company sponsored the tournament on previous occasions. That is the weakest defence he could give. If he spent this money to develop recreational services for young people throughout the country to prevent them from taking up smoking there might be some justification for it. This is not an anti-smoking sponsorship. It represents a PR spin doctoring opportunity for the great master of spin, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. There is no justification for it.</P>

      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will have as much to say in response to the question I now wish to ask. On 4 January, the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, wrote to the Taoiseach outlining the serious concerns over the conflict of interest that arises with the joint treasurer of the Fianna Fáil Party, the current Minister for the Environment and Local Government, having promulgated a Bill to substantially increase the allowable spend in the next election. Since that letter was written, it has emerged that the Minister concerned had given directions in this matter to his civil servants early last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in a written briefing to the spokesperson of the Labour Party, on the contents of the electoral Bill, omitted any reference to this essential part? Has the Taoiseach reflected on the points made in the letter of 4 January? When will he respond in writing to those points and does he now believe one of the two jobs currently held by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and Joint Treasurer of Fianna Fáil should be taken from him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received private correspondence to which I will respond. I do not see a conflict of interest in relation to anyone in this House, either in Government or Opposition, holding either a ministerial role or spokespersonship and being an officer for a political party. That has always been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked this question yesterday and the Deputy asked if I reflected on it. Deputy Gilmore <Col N="789" /> yesterday asserted that I misled the House and that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, misled Deputy Gilmore in relation to the electoral amendments. Both these statements are without foundation.</P>

      <P>The Bill comprises 57 sections. The electronic voting provisions account for 14 sections, while six sections deal with photographs, logos and ballot papers. The remainder of the Bill is comprised of a wide range of miscellaneous amendments on electoral law, including 31 amendments of the 1992 Electoral Act and other amendments of nine further Bills. On the Order of Business of 5 October, Deputy Gilmore, referring to the Government's legislative programme for the autumn session&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined clearly the concept of the Bill. I am not required to delve into the detail of promised legislation on the Order of Business. I gave an outline of the main areas covered by the Bill to be helpful to Deputy Gilmore at the time. In doing so, I indicated the Bill would include various amendments to electoral legislation, including providing for photographs, party logos, ballot papers and electronic voting. The Deputy knows my reply was neither required nor intended to be an exhaustive citation of every aspect of the Bill. Similarly, in providing Deputy Gilmore with a note on the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, provided an outline of the Bill's provisions. It is not the practice to provide exhaustive details of individual Bills.</P>

Does he accept that the person with a direct involvement in fundraising for Fianna Fáil should be the person to set the limits of expenditure for the next election? Will he also accept that an additional spend given to the Labour Party is totally pointless when we do not accept corporate donations and do not have the war chest that the Taoiseach is now gathering for the next election?</P>

        <b>:</b> A recent report by Gunne estate agents shows extortionate rises in the rents charged by private landlords during the past three years, particularly in Dublin, and illustrates the fact that young people and tenants in general are now at the mercy of these people to an extent that the great Michael Davitt, the champion of tenants, would find absolutely appalling. I understand that the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill is listed at the very end of the legislative programme and is not expected to be published until the summer of 2002, a date which lies beyond the lifetime of this Parliament. In view of that fact and in light of the report to which I refer, will the Taoiseach bring forward the introduction of the Bill and expedite relief for long suffering tenants as expeditiously as the Government yesterday approved massive pay <Col N="795" /> rises for Ministers, himself, politicians and high flyers in the public service?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 December last year the trustees of TSB requested me to authorise the reorganisation of TSB in accordance with the terms of a contract agreed by the trustees with Irish Life and Permanent plc. Having agreed, I have decided to propose the amendment of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, to provide explicitly for the sale <Col N="799" /> mechanism as proposed. The amendments are included in the restated and amended section 57 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, which makes up the bulk of this Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000.</P>
    <P>The proposal from the trustees, which they proposed following a full competitive sale process, involves selling the assets and transferring the liabilities of the bank to the Irish Life and Permanent group. The employees of TSB are to benefit from an employee share ownership trust agreed along the lines of ESOTs in Eircom and ICC Bank. The offer from Irish Life and Permanent values the bank at £339 million.</P>
    <P>The request and accompanying documentation from the trustees was examined by my financial advisers, Arthur Andersen, which advised me it was its belief that the sale process had been carried out by the trustees and their advisers in an open, transparent and fair manner. Arthur Andersen also advised me that the bid from Irish Life and Permanent plc represents full value for the bank and recommended that I authorise the reorganisation. I have also benefited from the legal advice of Arthur Cox. On 13 December I made a public statement of my intention to authorise the reorganisation and published the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the trustees' proposal.</P>
    <P>TSB was created by the amalgamation of TSB Dublin and the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank in 1992. Prior to the 1989 Act, and in accordance with their original purpose, the TSBs had been severely restricted in their range of activities. They were required to maintain at least 80% of their customers' deposits with the Exchequer and in terms of lending, they could only deal with personal customers.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the Dáil provided for a broadening of the range of activities of Trustee Savings Banks. This was provided for in response to the changing situation in the financial sector and to deal with the fact that the original purpose of TSBs was no longer widely relevant. Since 1989 the TSB has grown significantly. Customer deposits have increased from about £760 million in 1989 to over £1,775 million at the end of 1999. The number of employees has also increased from about 800 to more than 1,200.</P>
    <P>The trustees have, with the agreement of staff, reached the conclusion that the best interests of all the stakeholders in the bank will be best served by moving to the next stage of the process by changing the status of the bank and merging with the Irish Life and Permanent group. This change will give the bank access to the capital markets, a wider product range and a broader set of delivery and distribution channels, all of which are necessary if the bank is to continue to grow and prosper. Most importantly, it will provide continuity for staff and customers so they can benefit from ongoing developments in the banking market. This merger will also result in a very strong third competitor in the retail banking mar<Col N="800" /> ket and is to be welcomed in terms of competition.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, provided for the reorganisation of TSBs into companies. This section was incorporated in that Act because it was already clear from developments in the Irish financial markets and from the experience in countries such as Britain, France and Denmark that Trustee Savings Banks would need to become companies in order to adapt.</P>
    <P>The provision for the reorganisation of Trustee Savings Banks was broadly drawn in the hope that it could cover any likely scenario. It was anticipated it would only be necessary for the Minister for Finance to bring a draft of any order authorising the reorganisation of a TSB before both Houses of the Oireachtas and to secure a motion of approval before proceeding.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the 1989 Act provided for the reorganisation of Trustee Savings Banks into either companies controlled by the Minister for Finance or not controlled by the Minister. The latter option is being adopted for the current process. However, under section 57 as it currently stands, it is not possible to establish an ESOP in TSB as it does not have any shares. It is also impossible to establish the ESOP following the merger of TSB's operations with Irish Life and Permanent because it is not possible to establish an ESOT for a particular group of employees within one company. Therefore, it has proved necessary to have an intermediate step. The assets and liabilities are being transferred to Kencarol Limited, a subsidiary of Irish Life and Permanent, at which point the ESOT will be established and then immediately transferred on, with the ESOT in place, to Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation does not permit the establishment of an ESOP by a company while it is controlled by another company. Accordingly, section 2 of the Bill is required to allow for the establishment of the ESOT in Kencarol Limited while it is controlled by another company.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the employees are in favour of the transaction. Their employee rights, including conditions of employment, are protected by employee rights legislation, particularly the EU Directive on the transfer of undertakings. In addition to this, the business sale agreement specifically provides for the protection of the employees' rights including their pension entitlements. The employees will benefit from an employment share ownership trust under which 5% of the shares in Kencarol Limited will be transferred by the trustees to the ESOT in return for agreement to the transformation agreement and the ESOT is purchasing a further 9.9% stake in Kencarol Limited for £19.8 million. On completion of the reorganisation, the ESOT's Kencarol shares will be swapped for shares in Irish Life and Permanent plc., worth £50.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> As with all other ESOTs, the ESOT must hold the shares for a period of three years before it can allocate shares to employees through an approved profit sharing scheme. The maximum tax efficient allocation by an APSS is £10,000 per annum per employee. Deputies should note that while the transformation agreement envisages redundancies, it is a requirement of the agreement that all redundancies arising from the transaction must be on a voluntary basis only.</P>
    <P>Separately from this Bill, provision is being made in the Finance Bill to ensure that the benefits of the ESOP due to the employees of TSB will be maintained after the merger with Irish Permanent. Specific exemptions are being created for TSB and also for ICC Bank, where the same issue arises.</P>
    <P>As amendments were required in any event, the operation of section 57 in its entirety was examined and further amendments were proposed in order to provide certainty, in legal terms, in its operation. The net effect is that the existing section 57 is being restated in this Bill in its entirety but in an amended form. The main amendments are additions to provide for the ESOP, the structure of the transaction and certainty in relation to the transfer of assets and liabilities, including property and customer accounts, from the TSB to the Irish Life and Permanent Group. The other amendments are of a minor nature.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detail of the Bill, I want to deal with two issues which may concern Deputies &ndash; the use of the proceeds of the reorganisation and the possibility of branch closures. The present TSB is the result of the amalgamation of many trustee savings banks over the years. These trustee savings banks were founded to provide a service to small savers. The legal advice from the Attorney General has always been that the Oireachtas has the power to dispose of the assets of trustee savings banks. This was reflected in the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, which consolidated the legislation and provided for the regulation of TSBs by the Central Bank and also empowered them to trade on a fully commercial basis. The power of the Oireachtas is subject to the condition that the rights of depositors are fully protected in relation to their deposits and the interest thereon. The net proceeds from this process will be paid into the Central Fund for the benefit of all citizens. I am satisfied that this is the correct course of action.</P>
    <P>Another issue of concern to Deputies and customers of TSB and Irish Permanent is that of branch restructuring. While there are more than 40 branches that overlap between the two institutions, I have been advised that the merged bank will not close both their branches in any single location and that they will continue to serve all the communities now served by either of them.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the sections of the Bill. Section 1 substitutes a new section 57 for the existing section 57 of the 1989 Act. As there are numerous additions to the section, the advice of <Col N="802" /> the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government was that section 57 should be restated in its entirety for ease of use. I will go through each subsection, explain its purpose and indicate whether it is an existing subsection or an addition. I will point out any amendments made to existing subsections.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is an existing subsection which defines certain terms used in the section. It has been expanded to include such new definitions as are necessary for the operation of the section. Subsection (2) is an existing subsection which provides that I can make orders for the purposes of this section and that I can also make orders amending or rescinding orders made previously. Subsection (3) is an existing subsection which provides that an order may authorise the reorganisation of one or more trustee savings banks into either a company controlled by the State, referred to as a State company, or a company not controlled by the State. In the current transaction this is Kencarol Limited.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is a new subsection which confirms that the trustees have the power to enter into contracts to effect a reorganisation subject to an order. It also empowers them to sell or otherwise transfer shares received by them in any reorganisation to an ESOT subject to an order. The subsection also provides that the trustees are carrying out their duties as trustees in exercising the powers conferred on them and complying with the obligations imposed on them by this section. As such, the personal liabilities of trustees in relation to a sale process are limited as set out in section 22 of the 1989 Act, as is the case with their other duties.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) is a restatement of the existing subsection (4) which provided for the reorganisation of TSB into a State company. It stipulated the matters that the order should take into account. There is one amendment to the subsection in paragraph (<i>g</i>) which prohibits the transfer of the Minister's shares other than to a director of the company. The amendment allows for the transfer of shares to an ESOT. This subsection is not being used in the current transaction but the amendment is being made for the sake of completeness as the 1989 Act is not being repealed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) is a restatement of the existing subsection (6). Paragraph (<i>b</i>), which provides for the payment to me of the proceeds arising from the reorganisation into Kencarol Limited, has been amended to take into account the fact that the trustees will have proceeds arising from the transfer of shares to the ESOT. Subsection (7) is the existing subsection (5) which provides that an order may provide for the transfer of specified assets to me. It is not being used in the current transaction.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) includes the existing subsection (7) but there have been additions. It provides that the 1989 Act will not apply to a company not controlled by the State and that it will be subject to the Central Bank Act, 1971. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) has been added to provide that the order may make <Col N="803" /> provision for the regulation of Kencarol Limited in the period during which it has the assets and liabilities of TSB Bank. This is to avoid a gap in the regulation by the Central Bank of the operations of TSB Bank. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) is a new paragraph which provides that from the transfer date the trustees will cease to act as trustees in the business of the bank. Paragraph (<i>e</i>) provides that the trustees shall continue in office to comply with their obligations in relation to the final accounts of TSB Bank prior to the transfer date. Paragraph (<i>f</i>) provides that any trustee who becomes an employee or officer of either Kencarol or Irish Life and Permanent shall cease to be a trustee.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) is a restatement of the existing subsection (8). It provides that the order may provide for the conditions of the staff. It is not being used in the current transaction because staff's entitlement and conditions of employment are protected by employment rights legislation and provision has also been made for the staff in the business sale agreement between the trustees and Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) is a new subsection which makes certain provisions in respect of the period after the transfer of the bank's operations to the Irish Life and Permanent group. It provides for the dissolution of the TSB, the distribution of the proceeds of the reorganisation to me, the preparation of accounts by the trustees for this period and vacation of office by the trustees.</P>
    <P>Subsection (11) provides that Irish Life and Permanent will be able to use &ldquo;TSB&rdquo; in its name subject to conditions that will be set out in the order. This is required because section 14 of the 1989 Act prohibits anyone other than a trustee savings bank using the name or its derivatives. I consider this is a reasonable, commercially sensible approach and I am satisfied that, subject to the conditions I will place in the order on the use of the name, it will not cause any confusion.</P>
    <P>Subsection (12) is a new subsection that provides for the technical aspects of the transfer of operations from TSB Bank to Kencarol Limited and on to Irish Life and Permanent. It has been modelled on provisions in the Central Bank Acts and similar legislation that provide for the transfer of the operations of one financial institution to another. Subsection (13) is a new subsection that provides for the transfer of TSB's properties to Kencarol Limited and on to Irish Life and Permanent plc. Subsection (14) is a restatement of the existing subsection (10). It is not being used in the current transaction.</P>
    <P>Subsection (15) is the existing subsection (11). It requires me to obtain a motion of approval from each House of the Oireachtas for the draft of any order I propose to make under this section. I will lay the draft order before each House as soon as possible after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (16) is a new subsection that disapplies section 60 of the Companies Act, 1963, to the provision of assistance by Kencarol Limited <Col N="804" /> or Irish Life and Permanent or the ESOT company in the acquisition of shares by the ESOT. Similar provisions have been made in legislation dealing with Telecom Éireann and ICC Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 2 extends the original provisions of section 64 of the 1989 Act. That section provided an exemption from stamp duty arising from a reorganisation. This exemption is being extended to the second step of the current transaction, the onward transfer from Kencarol Limited to Irish Life and Permanent. This is being done because the only reason Irish Life and Permanent is going through Kencarol Limited is to facilitate the establishment of the ESOT in accordance with ESOP legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends Schedule 12 to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to allow Kencarol Limited to establish an ESOT even though it will be controlled by Irish Life and Permanent plc., at the time. This is necessary because it is not possible to establish the ESOT prior to the transfer to Kencarol Limited because the TSB in its current structure does not have any shares.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a standard section setting out the short title and collective citation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is the end of a saga in which the three banks, ACC, ICC and TSB, were supposed to have amalgamated into a third lending institution. Fortunately or unfortunately that did not occur. Whatever went wrong with the original idea for the amalgamation of all three, this is the final episode in the sale of these banks.</P>
      <P>Rationalisation means there is a possibility problems may arise. The most obvious problem is one the Minister mentioned &ndash; rationalisation of the branch network and its consequences for employees. I cannot accept that rationalisation will occur in an easy transition, as the Minister outlined. It is inevitable that despite the guarantees given at this stage, there will be some job losses as a result.</P>
      <P>The front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> property supplement makes it obvious that this rationalisation is even hitting the property market. No less than six major banking institutions' buildings, such as administrative centres and headquarters, are being offered for sale. At that rate, is it not an appropriate deduction that this rationalisation will cause problems for staff and for customer access? Most commentators have indicated that this was a good sale and the price was right. The Minister and the Government have been major benefactors and Irish Life and Irish Permanent have also been winners. The employees' share options mean they are also winners here but someone has been left out &ndash; the loyal customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the changes to mutual societies, either through amalgamation or privatisation, all of them have, at one stage or other, acknowledged the customer with some sort of benefit. I do not know why the customer has been left out <Col N="805" /> in this case. Of all the sales of building societies &ndash; which were mutual societies beforehand &ndash; this is the only one in which the customer has been omitted. I call on the Minister to rectify this by way of an amendment which allows him to make an <i>ex gratia </i>payment to all the loyal customers of the TSB, as they seem to have been forgotten. Irish Life and Irish Permanent have acknowledged that it was good for them and at some stage the Minister should make provision for an <i>ex gratia </i>payment to customers. The employees have accepted their share options but there is a downside for them in terms of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>It is reckoned that by the end of this decade 50% of the current banking facilities here and in Europe will have been rationalised, which will have serious consequences. The Minister cannot guarantee long-term job security for bank employees, nor can he guarantee access for customers. The Minister said competition will be enhanced but it will be the opposite now we have the third largest banking institution in the country being created by this sale. It is obvious that the TSB's small customers will find normal conditions of banking will apply now they are part of a larger bank. The Bill refers to liabilities and depositors but what protection exists for the ethos these customers once enjoyed in the TSB? Will those customers be as important to the new bank? Will they have the same access, facilities and conditions as customers with the TSB? I doubt it. Members who deal with other banking institutions know those banks have become more centralised and that the traditional importance of the local branch network has gone. If one receives a letter from one's bank about an account it comes from College Green. Banking has become faceless and this sale of TSB will mean a loss of the kind of personal banking we are used to.</P>
    <P>On-line banking has a definite downside. It caters for big business and wealthy customers but we are talking here about account holders who will be swallowed up and forgotten, which concerns me. TSB, ACC and ICC have branch networks in small towns throughout the country and rationalisation will mean that the choice offered by those institutions will be reduced. An additional difficulty is presented by the fact that AIB and Bank of Ireland are looking carefully at their network of outlets and are threatening to close them down unless there is pressure from the public, town development companies or chambers of commerce to retain the branch. Such local bodies have to tell these institutions to stop as they are going too far.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people with small pay cheques. Last November the Bank of Ireland hoped to be in a position to stop cashing cheques over the counter for customers. This meant that many people with social welfare cheques or local authority or health board employees could no longer walk into the bank on a Thursday or Friday and cash their cheques over the counter. If this is the <Col N="806" /> end result, it is time somebody somewhere asked if this is the right way to conduct banking. The Celtic tiger is bouncing along and the banks are responding quickly to the major opportunities that exist with regard to large customers at the expense of small savers who are loyal customers of the TSB. It will be regrettable if the ethos changes.</P>
    <P>In one of his last reports in December 1999, the chairman of the TSB indicated the vibrancy of the bank. There was growth in all areas of the business, lending, saving and mortgages. However, this has reduced in the past 12 months or so because of uncertainty about the bank's future. There is an idea that there is no place in the economy for small lending institutions. This is the reason for the current developments and it is regrettable. The chairman said the TSB's pre-tax profits of 40.3% were the result of an extremely satisfactory period for the bank. He said the loan book continued to show impressive growth, that advances grew by 24% and that the deposit side of the business grew by 16%. This is a good record for any financial institution and its vibrant growth is reflected in the bank's sale price to Irish Life and Permanent.</P>
    <P>However, the original concept was to amalgamate the ACC and TSB. Traditionally, the ACC was good to rural Ireland and the farming community. In many cases it provided facilities that the other major commercial institutions would not provide. If a farmer brought a development plan to the Bank of Ireland or AIB in the 1970s, as most farmers did, he had to sign away his soul to get access to development funds. However, the ACC provided support and services and, much to its credit, it acknowledged difficulties. During times of difficulty in farming in the past, the ACC was always willing to acknowledge the fluctuation in market prices that occasionally meant farmers could not meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>The ICC operated in a similar way with regard to business and industry. They gave many small businesses and entrepreneurs the opportunity to make proposals. Their plans were supported and encouraged by the ICC. The other major commercial banks rejected such plans because of a lack of sufficient capital, backing, property or collateral. The TSB deals in the main with small savers. If a person has money to invest today and goes into a bank, the only thing he or she will get is an assurance that the money will be safe. There are no offers of a return on the investment. In the past, the Trustee Savings Bank gave a reasonable return to its customers on investments.</P>
    <P>I hope amendments will be tabled to the Bill. Regarding rationalisation, the sale of property is not of concern to most people. However, the safety of employees' positions is a matter of concern. This aspect must be dealt with in stronger terms in the Bill. I am not convinced by the undertaking given by Irish Life and Permanent regarding the security of employees' jobs. We are aware of what happened in the past when another banking enterprise came to Ireland. It gave plenty <Col N="807" /> of assurances but, within months, due to reasons of which it said it was not aware initially, there was a change of policy and employees felt threatened. They had to fight to secure the long-term security of their jobs. In this case, the purchasers will benefit; the only people who will lose are the customers. I ask the Minister to rectify this during the later Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000, until such time as the Government publishes an appropriate financial scheme to recognise the loyalty of long-term depositors with the Bank.</P>
      <P>I was surprised and bemused by the Minister's contribution. He effectively introduced a set of technical amendments and made entirely technical arguments. However, the Bill is worth more than technical arguments and amendments to one section of an Act passed 12 years ago. This is important legislation because it privatises an asset that has been, more or less, in public ownership for 200 years. It seeks, in effect, to create a third banking force and it deserves more than the Minister gave it earlier. The Minister is capable of giving it much more than he gave it earlier.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on the Government and the Minister to make the argument for privatising the TSB. There is an onus on the Minister to make the argument for disposing of a State banking sector. It is not sufficient or adequate to propose an amendment to section 57 of the 1989 Act as if the matter was only technical because it is anything but technical. People want to hear the argument and engage with it and they are entitled to do so.</P>
      <P>I confess that I have mixed feelings about the Bill. I recognise that the creation of TSB-Permanent represents a good deal for the bank and, most likely, its customers in the current circumstances. I support the Bill in that sense. However, I would have preferred if matters had developed differently over the past ten years. For me and my party there is a feeling of missed opportunity. As the Minister is aware and Deputy Burke noted, we argued ten years ago for the creation of a third banking force from the three State banks in co-operation with An Post, but for various reasons, that did not happen.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is passed and the deal that underpins it goes through, a third banking force will be created &ndash; albeit a third banking force in the private sector &ndash; I will refer to that aspect later. Ten years ago I and the Labour Party thought the TSB could have been the core of a genuinely progressive and competitive third banking force in the State sector. Unfortunately in 1989, before I came into this House, we cut the TSB loose and the possibility of consolidating with other State banks ceased to exist some time in the mid-1990s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> As the Minister stated, savings banks were set up in the early part of the 19th century to enable small savers to save. Over the decades a great deal of amalgamation and consolidation took place. Having started out as a local savings bank, the TSB effectively became and is a national bank. It then got into additional services such as providing mortgages and lending. It started out providing services to individual customers, whereas now it also deals with business, particularly in the SME sector. It is true that the focus of the TSB is still the small saver and small business, but nonetheless there has been a gradual and significant shift in the focus and ethos of the bank, particularly since we passed the amending legislation in 1989. Effectively, the bank is just another small bank, and I do not mean this in any sense pejoratively. That being so, it was always inevitable, and certainly increasingly so in the past few years, that it would get caught up in the wave of amalgamation which is currently going on in the banking sector.</P>
    <P>I want to briefly state my attitude to privatisation. It would be stupid and dishonest to suggest that there is not an element of ideology here; clearly there is. The Labour Party has always supported the semi-State sector. We supported and still support the great public utilities which have given considerable service over many decades. We supported the creation of the commercial semi-State companies and we also supported and still support direct State intervention where the market fails to provide. Having said all of that, State intervention or privatisation must always be driven and decided by a detailed and practical assessment of the needs of any particular sector, utility or industry. Above all, those decisions must be driven by the public interest and the needs of consumers.</P>
    <P>For me, there are two broad tests which I apply to decisions of this kind regarding privatisation. First, is it a good thing to privatise? Second, is there a good reason to retain the utility within the State sector? Both tests must be answered satisfactorily before we make a decision and this marks a significant difference between the Minister, me and my party. The Minister believes that privatisation should be the norm unless there is a very good reason for not implementing it. I suggest he believes there are very few reasons to retain it within the State sector whereas I believe we should only sell if there is a strategic reason to sell.</P>
    <P>This difference reflects itself only too well in our approach to the State banking sector. The Minister has not ever made any secret of the fact that he has believed for quite some time that we should sell off all of the State banks, possibly including An Post, although I am not quite sure about that. He has not attempted to justify or explain that view in any real way other than to repeat the mantra that &ldquo;The current position is not an option&rdquo;. It is an approach born totally out of the Minister's ideological position on the public sector. It has little to do with the needs of the <Col N="809" /> sector and much less with the interests of the customers.</P>
    <P>Our approach is quite different. Only a few weeks ago, as the Minister will be aware, I opposed the sale of ICC Bank. I did so because I believed and still believe that ICC Bank had an important strategic role to play in supporting small business. My view was supported by other Deputies &ndash; Deputy Burke has made similar comments here this morning &ndash;  who believed that ICC Bank had a role in supporting small business. Many of those Deputies had a background in small business and experience of dealing with the bank. ICC Bank gave the State useful leverage in an important sector and it was a mistake to forgo that leverage.</P>
    <P>To return to the TSB and the two tests I mentioned earlier, is there any persuasive reason to retain the TSB in the ownership of the State? I suppose that is the critical question and I suppose the honest answer is, &ldquo;Not really&rdquo;. The truth is that unlike ICC Bank, TSB does not have a strategic role. As I said earlier, it has developed into another small bank. It is true that it evokes important local loyalties, particularly in Limerick and Cork. It continues to focus on small savers and small business, but in truth this is more of a reflection on the bank's origins than anything else. Even in the few short years since the 1989 Act was passed, the bank has become more commercial and more business oriented and clearly this trend will continue, whoever owns the bank. In brief, the defining characteristics of TSB are nothing like as clear cut as they once were.</P>
    <P>As an aside, the credit unions are beginning to fill the gap which TSB at least in part has left behind. They now fill that niche in the market in dealing with the small customer. Equally, it is interesting to observe that the credit unions have also started down the road TSB has followed, starting off with a form of automation and using improving technology and then dealing with parts of the market other than purely lending and saving. It will be interesting to see just how far down that road the credit unions will be in ten years.</P>
    <P>We also must question whether the State in any real sense owned TSB in any event. The structure of the bank evolved over the years into something which is obviously completely different to just about any other State-owned body or utility. Certainly for many years the bank enjoyed State indemnity. The State effectively underwrote the deposits so that if the bank were in any sense to fold or default on a particular deposit, the State would step in, although to the best of my knowledge it never had to do so.</P>
    <P>Currently the bank is run by trustees and since 1989 it is under the supervision of the Central Bank. The trustees perpetuate themselves in a fashion which is certainly not democratic and certainly not in any sense accountable to the Minister. The Minister or the State may well own the bank at least in theory but it is only in the very narrow sense that the Minister is entitled to the proceeds of any sale. TSB is not now and really <Col N="810" /> never has been a serious instrument of public policy. I doubt whether any Minister has ever attempted to tell TSB what to do in terms of what market they should look to enter or anything of that kind. Certainly it is true to say that had any Minister attempted to do so in recent years, he or she would have got a pretty frosty reception. I remember that 18 months ago when the new bank proposal was first floated, it was made quite clear by TSB that it did not really want to be told what to do and wanted to maintain its operating independence for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>The second question I pose is this: is there any good reason to sell TSB? I do not suppose we can seriously answer that question without looking at the proposal being put before us. On the face of it, TSB seems to make a good match with Irish Life and Permanent. It combines the expertise of Irish Life in life assurance and pensions, Irish Permanent in mortgages and TSB in money transmission products. The figures given in the briefing to the press by the two joint chief executives when they announced this proposed deal a few months ago are interesting. They tell us that on completion of the deal the group, TSB Permanent, will have a 25% share in the mortgages market, 12% in savings, 20% in life and pensions, 20% in new car finance and 10% in current accounts. This market share puts the new bank comfortably in third place in Irish banking and puts it in a position to compete with the big two banks over a fairly broad spectrum of business. Needless to say, we all hope the new bank will do just that, that it will genuinely compete with the other two banks and other banks in the sector rather than simply slot comfortably into the cartel which has been Irish banking over many years, as is clearly a danger.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Labour Party has argued in the recent past for a third banking force based on the State sector and we looked to do this by combining ACC Bank, ICC Bank and TSB, in co-operation with An Post. The concept was a very solid one but for a variety reasons, into which we do not need to go now, it did not come to pass as we hoped. However I emphasise that in passing this Bill, we are creating a third banking force. The new bank is privately owned and run, but it is made up of two financial institutions which were owned by the State in the very recent past and one former mutual society, namely Irish Permanent. We have our third force, albeit in the private sector, but there is good reason to hope and believe that the new force will perform much the role which we envisaged for the State third banking force ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The primary role of any third force has to be to provide customer choice and competition. Ultimately, ownership does not matter if there is genuine competition in the sector. The State can and should have provided a buffer against cartelisation by having a presence in the marketplace based on ownership. There is no reason, however, rigorous enforcement of competition law cannot do the same job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> Looking at the synergies in the new alliance and at the initial market share it will enjoy, it is clear there is genuine potential for the new bank. Undoubtedly, the amalgamation will be good for the banks but it should also be good for customers in that the new bank will be able to offer a full range of financial services, something which, at the moment, neither of the two parts can do as individual entities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the details of the deal or, specifically, the amount of money the State is getting as part of this deal, the State is receiving 430 million in total in exchange for TSB Bank. What is most striking about this figure is that it is significantly higher than the evaluation given to the bank only a year ago by Arthur Anderson. When that company valued the bank for the purposes of deciding on the ESOP and subsequently agreeing it, it was valued at 254 million or £200 million. There has been an increase, therefore, in the value of the bank of nearly 70% during a period of less than one year.</P>
    <P>There have been changes in the financial markets and in the value of financial stocks over the past year, but it is difficult to see how anyone could justify such an enormous increase in price. Thankfully, it is not a reduction but an increase in price. Nonetheless, a change from 254 million to 430 million in less than one year seems staggering and requires explanation to this House.</P>
    <P>The primary beneficiaries of the increase in price are the State and, more specifically, the workforce. The ESOP was based at the lower evaluation so that they are getting 14.9% in exchange for a borrowing of only £3 million or £4 million. What they are getting now is valued at a great deal higher.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to say &ldquo;Fair play to you, lads&rdquo; to the unions that negotiated this ESOP deal and to the workforce in TSB. I will not gainsay that. It is, by any standards, a good deal. I have said before in this House that we have to look at the way these things work.</P>
    <P>The ESOPs in various State companies have yielded different benefits, cash in most cases, to individual workers. This one will be worth in the region of £40,000, or 50,000, to each individual over a period of time. One wonders whether this is not entirely arbitrary or, in some cases, unfair.</P>
    <P>There is an additional aspect in this particular ESOP in that TSB is being amalgamated with another entity and, as the Minister has said, people who previously worked for TSB will be working alongside people who previously worked for Irish Permanent. The TSB employees will have significant share options, which will be of considerable value to them over a period of time, whereas the Irish Permanent employees will not. The Irish Life employees have some arrangement but not the generous arrangement that will apply to TSB employees. It is not difficult to imagine that that will lead to certain tensions in the workforce over a period of time, when two people are <Col N="812" /> standing side by side doing the same job and one has considerable additional fringe benefits.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of financial participation by the workforce in enterprise, whether in the private or the public sector. The way in which this has worked in the public sector, however, is, to say the least, disorganised. We need to look at this matter carefully in the future in relation to the State sector. We should extend share ownership and financial participation to all companies in the State sector as soon as possible, and it should not be done as a bribe to smooth the path to privatisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke raised the important issue, covered in our amendment today, of what happens to the proceeds. I met Mr. Went and Mr. Lorton a few weeks ago and they made the point, powerfully and correctly, that what happens to the proceeds is not a matter for the individual banks or the management of either bank. It is purely, solely and totally a matter of political decision by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke pointed out, correctly, that when the building societies were demutualised, an effort was made to recognise the loyalty of long-term customers in those mutual societies. That was the right thing to do. No doubt the Minister will come back to me and say that the legal structure of building societies is different, that the individual members of mutual societies had to vote on whether to demutualise and that this was caught up in that different legal structure.</P>
    <P>My mother is a customer in Irish Permanent and TSB, both in Artane. As I said to Mr. Went a few weeks ago &ndash; she would not thank me for repeating it, but it is true &ndash; she got a few extra shares, free shares, from the Irish Permanent when it was demutualised. I do not fancy going to her to try to explain why her loyalty to TSB is not similarly rewarded when TSB is privatised in a few weeks' time.</P>
    <P>There is a powerful, overwhelming, persuasive argument for recognising the long-term loyalty of customers of TSB, particularly deposit holders. I urge the Minister for Finance, even at this late stage, to reverse the decision he has taken not to recognise that loyalty.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly the case that customers of TSB have a greater sense of identification with the bank than do customers of, say, Bank of Ireland or AIB. That has a lot to do with the background of the bank. It is true, for example, in Cork and Limerick, where people have a sense of ownership which customers of the Bank of Ireland and AIB do not have. The State should recognise that loyalty and sense of ownership in a direct monetary fashion by giving some additional bonus.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when a new bank was on the cards about a year ago, indicated he would set aside certain shares for sale to customers. It is not of the same measure, I appreciate that, but some gesture will have to be and should be made to recognise the loyalty and sup<Col N="813" /> port of customers, in many cases going back over a long period. That decision is not a commercial one. It is a political decision, one which falls entirely to the Minister, and I hope he will reverse the position he announced heretofore.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister for Finance and Deputy Burke mentioned the issues of employee conditions and branch reorganisation. I have had the benefit of a briefing from the Minister's officials and am grateful for that. They have given me details of the carry-over conditions that have been agreed. The Minister should take the opportunity to spell those out for the record of the House in more detail than he has done before, as it is useful.</P>
    <P>Employees will want to have confirmed that their pension conditions, for example, will be fully met and will not be adversely affected by the amalgamation with TSB and Irish Permanent. They will also want it to be expressed clearly that there will be no compulsory redundancies as a result of the amalgamation that is due to take place.</P>
    <P>The issue of branch reorganisation is a greater issue. I accept the assurance being given that where there are two branches in a particular town, the town will not be deserted and that, at most, one of the branches will be closed down. That is fair enough. This is happening within all the major financial institutions. It is happening within Bank of Ireland where, for example, the branch in Clontarf, in my constituency, was closed. It is also happening in AIB.</P>
    <P>There is a case for giving the Central Bank or the Director of Consumer Affairs, or, if we ever see it, the single regulatory authority, whose role it will be to decide whether an adequate service is being provided in a particular town, a say in this matter. Before a small community, for example, is left without the direct presence of a branch of one of the banks, the bank would have to apply for permission to the regulatory authority to be allowed to withdraw its services from that community. We need to focus on that issue as it is something which has crept up on us in the past two or three years but which will clearly continue into the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Minister made clear that the Bill is very much a technical Bill. The strange legal structure of TSB is the reason behind that. We will need to examine that in detail on Committee Stage and I intend to contribute at that stage.</P>
    <P>To return to the major point I made at the start, I am not happy with this proposal. I would prefer that we were not privatising a bank that has been in the State sector or in public ownership of one kind or other for 200 years. The primary point is that we are creating an opportunity not just for the bank, of which I am sure they will take advantage, but also for the customers. That will require vigilance and enforcement of competition law.</P>
    <P>Members will want to express their appreciation of the work done over the years by the staff and management of TSB. I hope in their new <Col N="814" /> entity they will continue to give the good service to the community that they have given heretofore.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill, which I am glad is being introduced so early in the year.

I have since received another ten and now own 310 shares.<b></b></P>

      <P>I will not get into that. Any time I have been questioned on that topic I have been able to acquit myself and will continue to do so. Since my current accounts and other banking arrangements are with TSB, I have a direct interest in both financial institutions that are merging.</P>
      <P>In Portlaoise, each has a branch a few doors from the other and when they merge one will have to close. I hope all the employees can be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>That is life in this age of openness. I have very little to hide. It is all in the public arena. I will come to the issue of the TSB and myself regarding a point raised earlier.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the sale of the TSB to Irish Life and Permanent and set up the employee share option scheme, a standard feature of these transactions. There was recognition of the need for a third force in banking and the merger of ICC, ACC, TSB, and An Post Savings Bank was suggested to create a third savings bank under State control. I understand Deputy McDowell's concerns when he speaks in favour of that but the reality is that with economic changes we have moved in a different direction in relation to merging and reorganising State banking institutions.</P>
      <P>The sale of ICC to Bank of Scotland went ahead. This morning we have the new Bill to facilitate the sale of ACC and establish an employee share option scheme there. All of this is being done in different ways. If it had been a valid option these banks would have come together. Their businesses were so small that they needed a strategic partner to increase their range of business and to make themselves secure in the increasing banking sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other option should be considered by the Minister for Finance. An Post Savings Bank has large deposits and a network of nearly 2,000 branches. People can save in but not borrow through the local post office. The credit unions do a lot of work at local level but there is scope for An Post Savings Bank to advance loans like <Col N="815" /> the Royal Mail's savings bank in the UK. It would strengthen the post office network, especially in rural areas where less business is going through.</P>
    <P>This merger will create a third force in banking. As Deputy McDowell said, ultimately the sector needs to be well regulated and there must be competition for customers. The essential issue is that the public have a choice. Who owns it is not the primary issue. It is about customers having a range of services.</P>
    <P>The relevant banks said that the new institution will have 25% of the mortgages, 12% of savings, 20% of car finance, 10% of current accounts and 20% of pensions. It will be a major organisation with 4,000 staff and assets of over 30 billion euros.</P>
    <P>This new group will have over one million customers. The credit unions have 2.3 million. This leads to the assumption that there must be 15 or 20 million bank accounts for a population of 3.5 million. I do not know how active those accounts are. Under other legislation dormant accounts will be brought into the public arena rather than left in financial institutions earning money for them to which they should not be entitled. There is a package of legislative measures that I support.</P>
    <P>The new branch network will be important. In Portlaoise, Irish Life and Permanent is two doors away from the TSB. I know the management and staff in both and they recognise that only one branch can survive. I hope all the staff will remain in the employment of Irish Life and Permanent. There is a similar situation in Tullamore. This is an issue affecting every county.</P>
    <P>I expect good negotiations with the staff. I urge them to drive a hard bargain because if they do not they will be walked on. I always support employees in these cases. They are dealing with people whose purpose is to make a profit for the shareholders. Employees should seek to protect their own interests. I encourage them to get the guarantees they require.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to expect the Minister to give guarantees in respect of future employment in a bank or company anywhere. It would be wrong to do it and would mean that the company would not be independent. It will all come down to the quality of service the company provides, the number of customers they satisfy and whether their business can grow. I hope this merger will enable them to increase their business and secure the employment of people already working in these institutions.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies know of the recent trouble in Ulster Bank. There the employees had a hard fight but that is how things are. The staff are paying their dues to the unions for this and expect nothing less. In these situations employees have to be vigilant.</P>
    <P>This reorganisation of the financial sector does not just affect the banks mentioned but also the AIB, Bank of Ireland and others. In Laois recently two major banks closed branches in two towns. This was a major setback for these towns. <Col N="816" /> Where a bank is closing a branch in a rural town, as a minimum they should establish an ATM to ensure some banking facility remains. People should not have to drive 20 or 30 miles to get cash. Many towns like Durrow have no ATM. When young people get their pay cheques or the money is lodged in their banks they cannot access those funds. They have no option but to go to Portlaoise or the neighbouring town for cash. Then they do all their shopping in the supermarkets in the bigger towns thereby taking business from the smaller towns. It is essential that there be an ATM in every town so that the income earned by the people of the area can be accessed and spent locally if they choose rather than having to hike 10 or 20 miles to the nearest big town with an ATM.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that there will be further branch closures by the main banks because of the cost base. I could put my head in the sand and say that will not happen. Unfortunately it will continue to happen. Procedures to ameliorate this should be put in place for customers in those areas. Also people working in those institutions should be guaranteed their jobs. When a branch closes staff should have the option of transferring to a nearby branch. That is as much as we can achieve in this House because we cannot get into the detailed management of the companies. We will support the employees in any of the arguments they have with their employers in those situations.</P>
    <P>What is to happen the proceeds of the sale of this bank? TSB bank is now valued at 440 million. Over a year ago the Minister for Finance made a decision that the proceeds of the sale of all State assets would go into the new pension reserve fund. That was stated categorically by him in the House. It happened with the sale of all assets last year and it has given a great kick start to the pension reserve fund. That is in addition to the 1% of GMP that goes in on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify that by the end of the year when this transaction has gone through that this will actually take place? It is not referred to in his speech today but having spoken to him I understand it is stated Government policy. Initially he said it is going into the general State fund but before the end of the year a decision by Government will formally transfer the proceeds into the new national pension reserve fund, as happened with previous sales of State assets. I expect the matter to be clarified.</P>
    <P>The sale of State assets should not just fund current expenditure. In a booming economy we do not need extra income in the Exchequer current account. There are enough funds there already. The proceeds should be put away for the good of all in the years to come. I hope that will be clarified on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The employee share option scheme is also of concern. We considered this matter at the Finance and Public Services Committee when we were dealing with ICC Bank. Representatives from the bank gave us a copy of their financial statement last autumn. I did a quick run through <Col N="817" /> the statements and the value of the company. Employees were getting 15%. Based on the number of employees in ICC a rough calculation showed employees would get shares worth approximately £100,000. This is excessive. A person doing a job in a bank today who will continue doing the same work next month should not get a windfall of £100,000 when their colleague in another business or company or State service doing the same type of work has not the same opportunity. This type of bonus should not be given to people just because they happen to be in an institution where there is a change of ownership.</P>
    <P>There should be employee share option schemes. We have long left the old economic theory of labour and capital. The labour element in any business now includes the intelligence of the employees, not just the brawn. Ultimately the biggest asset of any company is its staff. When I worked in a professional chartered accountancy firm years ago it was always understood that the one asset of the firm was its staff. If the staff had a bad reputation so did the company.</P>
    <P>This 15% formula can create an outstanding windfall for some people, depending on the financial institution. Based on the figures mentioned by Deputy McDowell, if TSB is valued at 440 million then roughly 15% or 66 million will go to employees. If there are about 1,200 permanent employees that is about 50,000 per employee. That is a more realistic figure, probably about £40,000. Employees are entitled to some compensation when they move from State employment into the private sector where they do not have guarantees of their jobs as in the public service. Figures that can arise in these situations can give these procedures a bad name and cause jealousy and envy among those who cannot benefit also.</P>
    <P>Another concern is where senior management in the new companies can get share options. I have a bee in my bonnet about this. One of the biggest controversies in the eyes of the general public in relation to the Eircom privatisation was the share options that senior management managed to extract for themselves. It was wrong and obscene. They were not entitled to it and did nothing to earn the money but employ consultants to come forward with the proposals. The job of running any of these companies, be they privatised or in State ownership, remains the same before and after. There is no justification for people getting share options worth hundreds of thousands of pounds for no good reason. They have not earned it.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that when the Government relinquishes ownership and a company enters private hands the Government has no further say in the matter. There is nothing we can do about it because we no longer own the company. We all know these share options gave privatisation in England a very bad name. The water services executives were on share options worth a couple of million pounds while people had no water. The same happened with the train network. Although <Col N="818" /> I support the principle, it is on these issues that people take umbrage when they see people in organisations get millions of pounds worth of unearned share options just because they are in a privileged position where they can influence these things.</P>
    <P>It goes back to when the building societies were demutualised. One of the driving forces for demutualisation was the expectation of the senior executives that privatisation would give them share options. I guarantee that if there were no share options for senior management not one of them would have been demutualised. They would all continue to operate as they operate today. They were in a position to come to their board of directors and offer share options with privatisation. The deal was that the ordinary depositor like myself got a token 300 shares and that kept them happy. Demutualisation was then passed by the membership and the depositors in these institutions. We must watch the overuse of excessive share options.</P>
    <P>The change in banking structure is another concern. A new feature of banking in Ireland and around the world is direct or on-line banking. You get your loan over the phone and do not even have to see, meet or know where the bank is. All you need is an 1850 telephone number and you get your loan and have your money in your bank. It is brilliant and a great way of doing business for busy people. People might not like having to sit in front of a bank manager revealing personal details. It also frees up a lot of time and resources and overheads and makes the organisation more efficient. It is the way many banks are going. They are all developing that line of their business.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this I do so with a word of caution because I look at direct insurance. We are talking about the banking and financial industry. Last week, the Department of the Environment informed me that the motor insurance industry cancelled 32,000 valid policies last year. That figure has risen from under 10,000 four years ago. The figures have trebled in three years and this is due to the arrival of Quinn Direct into the insurance business. This company issues insurance policies by telephone. A quotation is given and the customer signs a direct debit form. Last year, Quinn Direct cancelled over 14,000 valid motor insurance policies. I received a complaint from a constituent and informed the company that its policy was out of step with other companies in the motor insurance industry, even though this is permitted under the legislation. I know the Minister will clarify on Committee Stage where the proceeds of the sale are to go. I support the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am totally opposed to another privatisation of a publicly owned asset by the Government. The Minister had a choice in regard to TSB. He could put the bank under State or semi-State ownership for the benefit of the people, or sell it to private interests. <Col N="819" /> There are no prizes for guessing what the Minister for Finance and the coalition Government will do.</P>
      <P>This is another example of the privatisation of public assets. Legislation to privatise ICC Bank has recently been before the Dail and the ACC Bank will also receive the same treatment. The Government attempts to justify the privatisation of these valuable public assets just as the politically late and unlamented Margaret Thatcher did in Britain. The argument is that it will bring about a share-owning democracy, that more people will share in the wealth of society and the lot of the working person will be enhanced. The opposite has been the case in Britain where a huge programme of privatisation has been vigorously implemented. There is now a higher concentration of wealth in fewer hands. The Tory government came into power in the late 1970s and began the programme that this Government is now following so slavishly.</P>
      <P>There has been a relentless campaign by Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, aided and abetted by Fine Gael which shares Fianna Fail's philosophy. Many Fine Gael members have been looking in the wrong direction for the source of the party's problems. They should not just look at personalities&mdash;</P>

      <P>There has been a relentless campaign for privatisation. The Labour Party has not offered any practical or philosophical opposition to the privatisation of public assets. The Dublin bus strike last year caused a clamour for the privatisation of Dublin Bus. There was a Pavlovian response by the right wing parties to a crisis within a publicly owned company which was starved of investment for decades and underdeveloped. The policy of subvention of public transport by low wages was ignored by the Government and Fine Gael and there were strident cries for privatisation.</P>
      <P>The sale of TSB will create a major new force in retail banking, to be called Permanent TSB. There will be a concentration of important sectors of the economy in fewer hands and there will be less competition. This new bank will have 25% of the new mortgage market, on a par with the Bank of Ireland. It will have 12% of the savings market and one million customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of more competition is given as the reason for the privatisation of public assets. What plans has this new entity for developing the assets which have been acquired? There will be a <Col N="820" /> reduction in bank branches from 155 to 110. This is an astonishing programme of savage cuts. There will be loud disapproval from the Deputies supporting this Bill at the effects of closures on provincial towns and rural areas. There will be job losses but what thought will be given to the workers involved? </P>
    <P>TSB was not operating at a loss. Pre-tax profits last year were £30.8 million. That is a substantial profit. Total assets of over £2 billion compare with Irish Life and Permanent assets of £7.8 billion. That is half the profit level of Irish Life and Permanent. I have taken these figures from the media. This was an enterprise which could potentially have been developed as a public asset in the interests of the people but the Government took the privatisation route. Privatisation is always and on each occasion a rip off both of the assets which properly belong to the people and of the people themselves. The infamous example of Eircom has hit home with the public although that has not been allowed to happen with many other privatisations. What we have now is a conspiracy of collusion between the privately owned media which support privatisation and the main political parties whose philosophy supports privatisation. Privatisation is not subjected to any real critical analysis because the private interests which dominate the media want to see their sector and private enterprise and big business generally benefit from the privatisations.</P>
    <P>There have been infamous examples which should be publicly denounced on an ongoing basis. In 1996 the Labour Party and Fine Gael gave the licence for the mobile phone network to a private individual for a song. It was sold for about £14 million or around that figure. Everyone knew it was like giving a gold mine that properly belonged to the people to a private individual. Four years later, what loyalty was shown to the people or gratitude shown to the Dáil that made this decision to sell the licence for a song? The company was sold to a multinational and the individual in question walked away with a personal gain of about £230 million. He was greeted in the main part in the media by the most obsequious articles lauding the entrepreneurship and business acumen of this individual and the company he founded despite the fact that everyone knew that one could not possibly lose money on the licence under the terms laid down for it.</P>
    <P>It is no surprise that, a few weeks back, that individual rewarded the parties who facilitated him so generously with an asset of the people by donating £50,000 to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party, which, I am happy to say, has had a change of view regarding corporate funding and has sent it back.</P>

      <P>The gas wealth of the west in the Corrib field has also been shamelessly sold out by the Government.

It is sad to hear the Labour Party attempting to say with soft soap and suds that what is happening with this merger and sale is akin to the idea the Labour Party had previously of a publicly owned third banking force. Deputy McDowell said ownership is not really important. He should read again some of the simple maxims of James Connolly, who founded the Labour Party which has become unrecognisably different from that time. One cannot control what one does not own. That will be the case once this entity is privatised and a new banking force is set up which will not be amenable to public or political control in any real sense towards obliging it to work towards social ends in the interests of a majority of the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In a debate on the Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill last year, I mentioned some figures which I found astounding and which showed the rip-off of the public sector by the main banking concerns. Not a word was heard from the main political parties or the media about it. I will repeat them briefly. The debt of £164 million was taken into the control of NET by the banks in 1987. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment told me last year that, up to 1999, NET had paid an incredible £188 million in interest alone on a debt of £164 million. NET borrowed during the 1980s and 1990s from the same banks simply to pay the interest back to them. This is a scandal <Col N="822" /> by any proportion. A State owned bank should have been given responsibility for that debt to manage it in a way that would not be a rip-off of the people and that certainly would not have robbed us to the extent that was done legally and with the oversight of successive Governments and the main political parties.</P>
    <P>As with all privatisations, the current measure is extremely short sighted. Growth rates of 10% in the economy have intoxicated the Government which thinks they will last forever. It is blind to the inevitable cycles of international capitalism but the warning signs are already on the way. One has only to read the financial press at present to see the prognosis coming from the United States of America regarding an imminent recession in that economy. We have a Government which has turned this island into an aircraft carrier for US multinationals to launch economic offences within Europe which, in turn, has created a massive dependency on the United States economy. When that recession strikes, which is predicted all over now, what will the multinationals and major companies do? They will retrench and cut the Irish workforce ruthlessly when it suits their profits, they will relocate to eastern Europe where they will find more easily exploitable labour and they will leave our people again at the mercy of recession and economic crisis.</P>
    <P>What then about our people who have invested so much in the obscenely priced homes they have been forced to buy? Will these private banking concerns allow them to stay in their homes when they run into trouble with their mortgages? It is precisely in this context in the next few years that we need publicly owned banking and other financial enterprises in this country which can deal with ordinary people in a humane and compassionate way rather than the brutal treatment they will receive from the main players in the market at present who will put profits above everything. We will see widescale attempts to repossess homes and small enterprises, bankrupt small businesses and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, is náireach an lá é nuair a thagann an Rialtas isteach sa Dáil ag príomháidiú comhlachta a bhaineann anois leis an gcóras poiblí agus a fhéadfaí a thógaint faoi úinéireacht cheart an Stáit agus a fhorbairt don Stát.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the preaching of the last speaker of doom and gloom, that the end is nigh and that we should prepare for the end of the world. While some of what he said might be valid, I do not agree with most of it. There is a notion that in times of recession or trouble, somehow or other one could expect a State-owned bank such as the TSB to be a soft touch and more generous than a commercial bank in dealing with its customers. That is an attitude we have been trying to kill for many years. In the case of local authority rents, for example, some take the view, &ldquo;I will pay the Corpo when I have a few bob&rdquo;. Like everybody else, State and semi-State bodies have to be efficient. Paying Dublin Corporation, therefore, should be at the top of one's list. The attitude should not be bred that because a body is State-owned, it has to be inefficient and can be ignored and that one can let one's arrears go through the roof. I do not agree with this philosophy, which was reflected in what Deputy Higgins had to say.</P>
      <P>For years there was talk that something would happen to the TSB. Various proposals were made. In some respects, I welcome the Bill because, at least, it shows that the matter has been resolved and that decisions have been made. There have been too many false starts and proposals which did not seem to be going anywhere.</P>
      <P>For good or bad, the TSB, certainly in Dublin, is looked upon very differently by individual depositors and ordinary constituents. The bank has many loyal customers who have been banking with it for a long time and who speak very fondly of it and in totally different terms than the other commercial banks. I do not know how it has managed to do this successfully, but it, obviously, goes back to its origins. Many of its customers speak highly of it and perceive it to be on the same level as the credit union and even more friendly than the building society. Many depositors have this perception and attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the Minister may say and what the legal advice may be, many equate the TSB with the credit union and building society and cannot understand why it is being sold. It is not that they are against this; because it is their perception that the bank is the equal of the credit union and building society they thought and expected that they would be treated in a special way and receive free shares or some of the proceeds. While I accept that the position has been explained to them and that the legal case does not stand up, we have failed miserably to convince them of this. I hope the TSB, its owners or the Minister will conduct an advertising campaign <Col N="824" /> or send a personal letter to all depositors because it is their perception that the bank which was created and fostered by them is somehow or other being swiped and that their special position and years of loyal service are not being recognised by way of free shares, as happened in the case of many of the building societies. That is how they see it, for good or bad. I hope something will be done to get the message across, even if nothing can be done in monetary terms.</P>
    <P>On the employees, I am concerned about the ESOP schemes, in which I fully believe. They are a great idea. I worked in a semi-State body for most of my life and wish I had had the opportunity to avail of such a scheme. The position is that because the social partners are now on board the trade unions will sit down with management and negotiate a share option scheme for employees, but what about pensioners? I have met pensioners who are of the view that they gave 35 to 40 years loyal service to the TSB and the ICC during which time they made many sacrifices. There was always a great attitude and motivation in the TSB and the ICC. The staff could always see the effects of their sacrifices and the benefits that accrued to the body concerned. The pensioners whom I have met are of the view, however, that those who are only in the job for two or three years are being bought off with a shareholding and are happy as a consequence. The social partners are also happy. While the trade unions bring retired members along to the Christmas dinner each year and smile at them, retired members do not seem to have any real influence. There is no one shouting on their behalf. Because of this, I am not happy with the way in which the ESOP scheme is being operated, although I accept that if one takes the shilling, the employees will be affected by any branch closures or rationalisation in years to come while pensioners will be safe. The official line is that the share offering is to secure efficiencies in the future rather than loyal service in the past. That is fair enough from one point of view but nobody is shouting for the pensioner who feels that his or her loyal contribution to TSB is not being recognised.</P>
    <P>The real movement on this must come not from the Minister but from the unions who are the central figures in this body. They are probably just looking at the subs they are getting, who is paying and who is paying today. This is one of the problems &ndash; everybody is looking at who is paying today and nobody is looking at the loyal service in the past. They are my two concerns. The second relates to all privatisations. I am not opposed to them in theory; I recognise how the world is progressing. I wish, however, that when we carry out privatisations we would look after the people who have given loyal service over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about competition. It is fine in theory but I do not see much of it in practice. Generally, the commercial banks, as far as the ordinary customer is concerned, are more <Col N="825" /> involved in big business and capital markets. That is probably where the money is but I see no improvement in the service and competition offered to the ordinary account holder. In fact, there is even more, rather than less, red tape involved in lodging and withdrawing money and I do not know if this legislation will affect that. There is a general movement in that direction in the sector and it is outside the remit of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister still talks about a question mark over the proceeds. I wish an effort were made to explain this issue to the people who have been depositors and clients of the TSB for many years. The legal jargon they have been confronted with thus far has not got through to them or if it has, they are not convinced. Somehow they have convinced themselves that they are special and are similar to credit union or building society investors. Cold technical legislation and statements do not get through to them. I hope something can be done about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. A number of Deputies raised the issue of ownership of TSB and suggested that the customers should receive all or part of the proceeds from the sale. Deputy McDowell is seeking an appropriate financial scheme to recognise the loyalty of long-term depositors with the bank. There are two issues in this regard. The first, which is a legal issue, concerns the ownership of TSB. The second issue is whether the customers should receive some or all the proceeds as a reward for being customers.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the ownership issue first. This has been the subject of legal advice from the Attorney General. The conclusion of this advice is that trustee savings banks do not have members and that they are not owned by their depositors. The relationship between TSB and its customers is the same as the relationship between any bank and its customers. The advice at the time of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, was that the Oireachtas had the power to dispose of the assets. Incidentally, a review of the debate in 1989 shows that all sides of the House agreed with this view.</P>
      <P>That Act copperfastened the legal position. Deputies will also be aware that in other State companies, customers are not shareholders either. Public assets such as these are held by the State on behalf of all citizens of the country. It is not open to me arbitrarily to allocate public owned assets to a small group of citizens. The only way I can discharge my overall duty in this regard is to take the proceeds of disposals into general public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies also compared the TSB to building societies where the customers got shares on demutualisation. There are fundamental differences between TSBs and building societies. Customers opening a share account in a building society are told that they become an owner of the society with the right to vote at annual general <Col N="826" /> meetings. It is the customers of a building society who actually run the society, elect the board of directors, decide to wind up the business or decide to demutualise. In the case of the TSB, the customers have no ownership stake, there are no annual general meetings of depositors, the customers do not elect the trustees and they have no role in the running of the bank or deciding to sell it. It is the trustees who have taken the decision to request a reorganisation. Finally, customers opening accounts in the TSB do so in accordance with the rules of the TSB which clearly state that they have the right to their deposit and the interest thereon. They are not given any indication or impression that their account confers any ownership interest on them.</P>
    <P>The second issue is whether customers in the TSB should receive some payment from the proceeds anyway. The argument put forward by Deputies is that they have been loyal customers for many years and that they built up the bank. Deputies also point to the unique status of the bank and say that unlike State companies, the State has not put in capital or given any assistance to the bank or its predecessors.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the latter point first. Until 1989, the TSBs kept at least 80% of their funds from customers on deposit with the Exchequer. Prior to 1979 almost all the TSBs' funds were deposited with the Exchequer. The customers received a rate of interest on their accounts which was funded by the Exchequer and the banks were paid a margin of 1.65% above this to cover their administration costs. The TSBs have throughout their history been funded by the Exchequer and customers effectively benefited from State support of their deposits. The customers had a choice about where to place their deposits which meant that the rate of interest payable always had to be attractive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The bank also funded the State's borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the 1989 Act, the TSB has been allowed to operate on the same terms as any other bank but, until 1992, it was exempted from corporation tax in recognition, <i>inter alia</i>, of the fact that the reserves of the TSB effectively belonged to the public generally. In fact, it was only in 1993 that the TSB started to pay corporation tax at a reduced rate and only since 1996 that it has paid corporation tax at the full rate.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, unable to support the amendment proposed by Deputy McDowell. The customers have no ownership stake in TSB Bank and this is also the situation in all State companies. I have to discharge my responsibilities to all citizens by taking the proceeds into State funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of branch closures was also raised. The Minister for Finance has no role in the day to day operations of Trustee Savings Bank or Irish Life and Permanent. I have been advised that the merged bank will not close both its branches in any single location and that it will <Col N="827" /> continue to serve all the communities now being served by either of them. I will quote from a public statement made last December by Mr. David Went, group chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent plc, on this matter. He said:</P>
    <P>Let me start by stating quite emphatically that &ndash; as a group &ndash; Irish Life and Permanent is committed to maintaining a strong branch network. And Permanent TSB will have that. Our plans envisage a combined branch network of approximately 110 branches. In a simple combination of the existing networks of TSB and Irish Permanent, there is clearly an overlap of as many as 45 branches.</P>
    <P>To deal with this, Permanent TSB will initiate a comprehensive and objective evaluation of all the branches of the combined entity. This will identify those which, in terms of design, size and location &ndash; will be best suited to offering the combined customer base full breadth of products in the most convenient and comfortable locations possible.</P>
    <P>And let me add, there will be no town which currently enjoys the services of either Irish Permanent or TSB Bank which will be left without banking services as a result of this exercise. And indeed we'll continue to review opportunities to open new branches.</P>
    <P>The issue of redundancies was also raised. I have been advised that there will be no compulsory redundancies as a result of the merger. In the memorandum forming part of the sale there are sections relating to the employees' rights and interests and I will quote from a memorandum concerning employees of the Trustee Savings Bank. On employee rights and interests, the memo states:</P>
    <P>(a) As the sale of TSB Bank is taking the form of an asset and business sale, the provisions of the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on a Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 1980 (S.I. No. 306 of 1980) apply to protect the rights of employees. This means that the employment of all employees of TSB Bank immediately prior to the sale is automatically transferred to the purchaser and that the same terms and conditions as they enjoyed with TSB will apply. This is expressly acknowledged in the Business <Col N="828" /> Sale Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) between TSB Bank, Irish Life and Permanent plc and Kencarol Limited (a subsidiary of IL&amp;P).</P>
    <P>(b) Pension arrangements fall outside the scope of S.I. No. 306 of 1980. Accordingly, the Business Sale Agreement expressly provides for Irish Life and Permanent to continue the pensions schemes which are in place immediately prior to the completion of the sale. In the Agreement, IL&amp;P have accepted a contractual obligation to ensure that such schemes continue to provide pension benefits for the TSB Banks employees which are broadly comparable to and no worse overall than the pension benefits provided to them in TSB Bank.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked why there was a 70% increase in the value of the bank between the ESOT valuation and the sale price. The TSB's financial advisers, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, valued the bank's operations at £200 million when the ESOT negotiations commenced in the early part of last year. This valuation was accepted by the trustees because it was consistent with the net assets and price earning &ndash; pe &ndash; multiples which prevailed for similar financial institutions at that time. The 70% premium paid to Irish Life and Permanent plc comprises three elements &ndash; the strategic pe premium typically paid by acquirers which is often in the range of 40% to 50% of the most recently quoted price of the company; the recovery incentives towards financial stocks during the sale process as investment is moved away from new economy stocks; and the competitive auction process in which IL&amp;P was engaged. My advisers, Arthur Andersen, agree with this view. The ICC sale was quite similar.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also referred to my attitude towards privatisation. I have outlined my views on the State banks in the form of parliamentary replies and during the debate on the ICC Bank Bill and I do not see the need to elaborate on those. I have clearly stated that I am in favour of disposing of the three State banks &ndash; ICC, ACC and TSB &ndash; and that the <i>status quo</i> cannot be maintained. The ICC deal has practically been finalised and the TSB deal will, hopefully, be completed in the coming months. We await developments in regard to the ACC. I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an Bhille tábhachtach seo &ndash; Bille na dTithe Gaeltachta (Leasú) 2000. Bille tráthúil é mar go dtuigimid uilig cé chomh tábhachtach is atá tithíocht sa Ghaeltacht agus ar fud na tíre. Cé go bhfuil cúrsaí eacnamaíochta ag dul i bhfeabhas, ceann de na deacrachtaí móra atá sa tír faoi láthair ná an tithíocht. Tá sé an-deacair ar dhaoine óga tithe a chur ar fáil dóibh féin agus is cinnte agus is amhlaidh atá sé sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Seo é an tríú Bille Tithíochta a tugadh isteach, chomh fada agus is eol dom, ó bunaíodh an Stát. Tugadh an chéad Bhille isteach i 1929 agus an dara ceann i 1979. Is cinnte go bhfuil feidhm agus gá leis an mBille seo mar tá athruithe móra tar éis teacht ar shaol na Gaeltachta ó ritheadh an dá Bhille eile. Ní hionann anois na coinníollacha atá ag gabháil le deontais do thithe Gaeltachta agus a bhí i bhfeidhm i 1929 nó fiú i 1979. Tá athrú mór tagtha ar shaol agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus fiú ar an dteanga féin idir an dá linn.</P>
      <P>Nuair a tugadh isteach Billí Tithíochta ar dtús i 1929, bhí an Ghaeltacht aon-teangach agus an Ghaeilge i réim ar fud an cheantair. Tá a fhios ag achan duine anois go bhfuil athrú tagtha fiú ar an dteanga atá á labhairt sna Gaeltachtaí: tá siad uilig dátheangach. Is minic a bhíonn teaghlaigh aonaracha dátheangach sa chás gur phós duine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta duine ón taobh amuigh agus cruthaíonn sé sin an-deacrachtaí teanga.</P>
      <P>Lena cheart a thabhairt don Aire Stáit, aithníonn sé na deacrachtaí sin, go háirithe ó thaobh na bunscolaíochta de. Aontaím go mór leis an scéim atá aige chun cúntóirí teanga a thabhairt isteach sna bunscoileanna ar fud na Gaeltachta fá choinne na deacrachtaí teanga a fhuascailt, nó ar a laghad tabhairt futhu.</P>
      <P>Tá rudaí deimhneacha sa Bhille seo ach ní théann sé fada go leor leis na deacrachtaí teanga a réiteach nó chun staid reatha teangan na Gaeltachta a aithint. Tá a fhios agam gurb eol don Aire Stáit agus dá chuid oifigigh na deacrachtaí a chruthaítear nuair a chuireann teaghlach iarratas isteach ar theach nua sa Ghaeltacht. Muna bhfuil Gaeilge ag an mbeirt acu is minic a dhiúltaítear an deontas dóibh. Nuair a phósann cainteoir dúchais as Alba nó ón mBreatain Bheag cainteoir dúchais Gaeilge agus nuair a thagann siad chun cónaí sa tír seo, níl siad i dteideal deontas a fháil mar nach cainteoirí dúchais Gaeilge an bheirt. Má dhiúltaítear do theaghlach mar sin, caidé an meas a bheas acu ar an nGaeilge sna blianta amach romhainn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ceist an-deacair agus an-chasta í seo agus níl a fhios agam cá bhfuil a fuascailt. Ach ní mór don scéim deontais atá i bhfeidhm sa Ghaeltacht aitheantas a thabhairt do staid reatha na teanga ann. Tá daoine ann a déarfadh go mba chóir deontais a thabhairt do gach duine a thógann teach sa Ghaeltacht. Ní rachainn féin chomh fada <Col N="832" /> leis sin. Ach níl fuascailt na ceiste le fáil sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Mar atá an scéim i láthair na huaire, tá sé ag déanamh dochar don teanga i gcásanna áirithe sa Ghaeltacht. Cad é an prionsabal a bhéas againn? An bhfuilimid chun daoine a spreagadh chun an teanga a úsáid nó an bhfuilimid chun an bata a úsáid? Ón méid atá foghlamtha againn go dtí seo faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge, is léir gur fearr i bhfad an spreagadh ná an bata.</P>
    <P>Tá an príomhleasú sa Bhille le fáil in Alt 4 agus tá lúcháir orm go dtugann an tAire faoin gceist seo a fhuascailt. Ábhar é seo a tógadh go minic sa teach seo. Nuair atá teach úr á thógáil, go dtí seo bhí sé de cheangal ar an iarrthóir agus a bhunadh a bheith ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Ní léiríonn sé sin saol na Gaeltachta mar atá sé i láthair na huaire. Ach is iomaí duine atá ar aithne agam atá tar éis teacht abhaile ón iasacht, teach a thógáil anseo  &ndash; agus tá an Ghaeilge chomh maith acu is a bhí riamh  &ndash; agus ní éiríonn leo mar nach raibh siad ina gcónaí anseo fad a bhí an teach á thógáil. Diúltaíodh do dhaoine anuraidh ar an ábhar sin agus tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil sé sin á athrú sa Bhille. Níl a fhios agam an féidir é a chur siar tamall agus deontais a cheadú do na daoine sin a diúltaíodh le cúig nó le deich mbliana. Ní thógfainn ar na daoine sin é dá mbeidís diúltach linn  &ndash; chuireamar amach as an tír iad agus nuair a d'fhill siad ní raibh muid ábalta an deontas a thabhairt dóibh ar an ábhar nach raibh siad ina gcónaí anseo fad a bhí an teach á thógáil.</P>
    <P>Athrú eile sa Bhille ná na deontais fheabhsúcháin atá á ardú ó £2,300 go dtí £4,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 30, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The visit of President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton to Ireland on 12 December was extremely successful. I was delighted that the President, the First Lady and Chelsea, their daughter, were able to pay a further visit here. Their visit helped to put the focus on all that had been achieved in relation to Northern Ireland during President Clinton's term of office and also, of course, on what remains to be done in order to overcome the present difficulties. It was at the same time an opportunity to celebrate the important economic relationship between Ireland and the US.</P>
      <P>My discussions with President Clinton on the morning of his visit focused primarily on Northern Ireland and, in particular, on the further implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. I took the opportunity to thank the President for his invaluable contribution to the process.</P>
      <P>Following our meeting, President Clinton and I attended a reception at the Guinness Storehouse celebrating Ireland-US Partnership in the Information Age, which was attended by a large number of guests including Members of the Oireachtas, a delegation of US Congressional representatives and persons, including from the local community, involved in the integrated area plan for the Liberties and its promotion as a digital district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> In the evening the President and I visited Dundalk, where I was very happy to introduce him to a large and very enthusiastic gathering at the Courthouse Square. The visit provided an excellent opportunity to highlight all the developments that have taken place in recent years in Dundalk and to bring out the difference that peace has made to the Border region. In a major address, the President made clear the importance of peace in regenerating the Border region and realising its full potential.</P>
    <P>I sent letters of congratulations to President George Bush on his election and on his inauguration as President of the United States. In his response, President Bush conveyed his strong support for the Good Friday Agreement, as he had done already in a letter he sent to me some months ago. I very much welcome and value this expression of support and commitment at the highest level of the new Administration in the United States which continues to be shared fully in the United States Congress, as clearly signalled by the visit to Dublin on Monday last by a cross-party congressional delegation headed by Congressman Ben Gilman of the House Committee for International Affairs, the letter released to the press by the delegation and the statements by members thereof after the meeting, including Congressmen Gilman and Peter King. I intend to travel to Washington in March for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. The specific arrangements for the trip have, understandably, not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>Since I reported to the House on matters relating to Northern Ireland on 13 December last, Deputies will be aware of the intensive discussions and negotiations that have been, and are, taking place between the two Governments and the pro-Agreement parties, and these will continue over the coming days. I will be meeting the British Prime Minister this evening in London to review all aspects of the current discussions and to decide how best to take them to a successful conclusion. Given the sensitive state of the talks, I ask for the House's understanding if I do not go into detail at this time. All my meetings and discussions with the Prime Minister and with the parties have been focused on overcoming the remaining difficulties in the full implementation of the Agreement. These difficulties centre around the issues of demilitarisation, decommissioning, policing and participation in meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>The plenary meeting of the British-Irish Council, which had been scheduled to take place on 23 January, was postponed to allow both Governments and the Northern parties to maintain their full focus on resolving these issues. The meeting is being rescheduled, subject to the availability of participants from all of the Administrations involved.</P>
    <P>I have not raised the matter of exilings by paramilitary groups with the parties in the current discussions. I have, however, made my position on this, and on the issue of punishment attacks by all <Col N="837" /> paramilitary groups, clear on many occasions and I will continue to do so. I am very concerned about sectarian attacks in Larne. The local Catholic community is living in fear, and this is unacceptable. Gun and pipe bomb attacks must not be allowed to continue. We have made the strongest representations on this matter through the British-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and called for immediate and effective action by the security forces. Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs have also travelled to Larne to speak directly to community leaders.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the work of the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Mandelson. During his period of office he worked tirelessly to advance the political process, and this is widely appreciated and valued. I wish him well for the future. I would also like to welcome his successor Dr. John Reid to his new portfolio. I spoke with Dr. Reid on the day after his appointment and, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister O'Donnell, I look forward to meeting him in Downing Street this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone when I say to the Taoiseach that he carries with him at his meeting tonight with the British Prime Minister our best wishes for a successful discussion on a number of outstanding issues which have yet to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Given the ongoing commitment to the cease-fire by the IRA and its supporters in Sinn Féin, will the Taoiseach comment on the incident earlier this week in Mitchelstown involving an IRA outfit which was armed to the teeth with baseball bats and other paramilitary weapons? Will he agree that the interception by the Garda Síochána was most necessary to stop this sinister development? Will he outline how it is possible for an organisation which claims to have called a ceasefire to engage in this kind of paramilitarism and roam the country and seemingly be a law unto themselves? How is this compatible with its commitment to a ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say I join Deputy Hayes in condemning whatever this group was about. It was armed with revolvers, pistols and baseball bats and I suppose we could all conclude that whatever it was about it was up to no good. I am aware of this incident and it is a matter of great concern. The four men concerned were arrested following the discovery of arms in the car in which they were travelling. I understand that all four men remain in Garda custody. The investigation is ongoing and it is not for me to comment on it while the Garda is dealing with it. However, I understand that it is likely to come to an assessment some time today. I assume it will take whatever action is necessary at that stage. The position of the Government on these subversive activities is very clear and unambiguous and there is no harm at the start of the Dáil year in me saying that. It could not be otherwise and I <Col N="838" /> have consistently and trenchantly condemned all subversive activity. I have also continually called on all concerned to enter fully into the democratic process and I do so again today. Until the Garda or the courts move on this matter, if that is what it takes, we cannot be certain. However, we can be certain that subversive activity in some form or another seems to be part of their mission.</P>
      <P>Today and for some time to come we will continue to try to move people from the belief that they can act in this fashion, to move away from subversive activity and we will try to deal with the issues at the centre of it. However, in the meantime, we will allow the Garda and, if necessary, the courts to deal with these individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the act of paramilitarism in Mitchelstown earlier this week puts a question mark over the commitment of the republican movement to exclusively peaceful methods, undermines the Mitchell Principles and repudiates the Good Friday Agreement? Will he commit himself to a much stronger statement of rejection of these people? Does he feel he has a responsibility to tell the political leadership of that movement that such a methodology and such a clear objection on the part of this paramilitary organisation to the democratic mandate in this State and to our security forces cannot and will not be tolerated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I can say all those things but the Deputy will understand that in relation to the four individuals the Garda investigation will be completed later today and then the decision on how their cases will be processed will become known. If the Garda believe they have sufficient evidence &ndash; and it sounds as if they do &ndash; it is an operational matter for them and it will then be a matter for the DPP. I cannot comment on the case but in general anybody going around with guns and baseball bats in a threatening matter, or engaging in paramilitary activity of any kind has to be totally condemned. We are all involved in trying to make sure these activities cease and that the people who have been involved in them move, as most of them have, into the democratic process or away from these activities. We must continue to do our utmost to deal with that. I hope that is the way in which most of these individuals are moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach in his discussions with former President Clinton take the opportunity not just to thank him for his work on Northern Ireland, which I was happy to be able to do, but to raise with him America's poor record in terms of providing aid to developing countries, its status as a primary contributor of greenhouse gases and its lukewarm backing for UN peacekeeping? Given that the former President took the opportunity in Warwick University after he left Ireland to refer to these issues, can the Taoiseach take any credit for reminding him about them? What else did he discuss with him, <Col N="839" /> apart from Northern Ireland, if he did not discuss some of those more global issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a number of our discussions over recent years we discussed some of those issues, perhaps not all of them. I do not claim to have had any influence on a speech that was probably written well before he met me. Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have continually raised the reform of the UN. Both of us, together with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, played a role at the UN Millennium Summit in the autumn. Everybody in this country is committed to Kofi Annan's UN reforms and the necessity for resources.</P>
      <P>The US has a significant role to play as it is a major contributor. There were some developments before President Clinton left office. He made sure that was the case and we have pushed this issue not on that occasion but on other occasions. There have also been discussions on what the US has been trying to do in terms of environmental policy and the Deputy will acknowledge that the previous US Administration &ndash; and I hope, the new one will as well &ndash; tried to change and address some of the criticisms which it received. Mr. Clinton tried to move on many environmental issues. I recall him arguing with me on one occasion about the economic effects and difficulties of doing so in a large country of 250 million people but he put in a considerable effort and made many speeches, not only last year but over the years, on this issue.</P>
      <P>On recent occasions when we met the former President, particularly in New York in early September at the Millennium Summit, we pressed strongly for support for Kofi Annan's reforms and the necessity to have them implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in the sensitive work in which he will be engaged this evening on behalf of all of us. I wish him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs success in that task with their British counterparts.</P>
      <P>In regard to the three significant outstanding issues, decommissioning, demilitarisation and policing, I will focus briefly on the policing issue so that Members can understand where the discussions are at. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government has urged the British authorities to meet what most of us in the House regard as the very reasonable requests made by the SDLP on the policing issue? What are the issues of contention between the Irish and British Governments in relation to policing? Will the Taoiseach indicate, since it is now the policy of the Northern Ireland Police Service to recruit members of the Garda, whether a similar gesture would enable the Garda to recruit from within the Northern Ireland Police Service? Demonstrating that level of interchangeability would be a welcome signal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="840" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The SDLP has indicated the areas in which it wants to make progress. It has been involved with the chief constable and the change management team to try to resolve the key outstanding issues for the party such as the special branch, the police reserve and the closure of Gough Barracks. Sinn Féin has a similar position although the SDLP and Sinn Féin positions are not precisely the same.</P>
      <P>There are seven key issues on which the SDLP has focused in the discussions since the first week of January. One flag with which everyone is familiar should fly over police buildings. The flag and emblem should be in accordance with the Patten report. There should be clarity on the name so that it is not a double barrelled name and it will be known as the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The special branch and crime branch should come under the same assistant constable and police officers should move in and out of the special branch so that they do not stay there for an inordinate time or for their entire careers, as happened in the past. The full-time reserve should be phased out before the current time scale of 2005 and the part-time reserve should be built up more quickly. Gough Barracks should be closed forthwith.</P>
      <P>Confidence building measures, including the public inquiries into the Nelson, Finucane and Hamill cases, have to be put in place to convince people that policing has fundamentally changed for the better. Arrangements for lateral entry from the Garda Síochána should be made quickly. There are also issues concerning the number of board members and voting mechanisms to be employed, which are important issues of a technical nature. Other issues include the district partnership boards and the numerical composition of the board itself. Those are the key issues and some of them can be undertaken without legislation or arguments about amending legislation. The SDLP believes that these issues can be undertaken without legislative changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the role of the Garda Síochána, as the Deputy knows, RUC personnel who took part in UN missions were partly trained in Templemore. There is a close working relationship on security matters, as never before, between the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne, and the RUC Chief Constable, Mr. Ronnie Flanagan. We have to approach any areas of police co-operation, in which we can help, with an open mind. While the matter has not been finalised, there is a view that if members of the Garda Síochána were to come in at certain levels it would provide a confidence boost for the new police service of Northern Ireland. We can learn much from the enormous amount of good policing expertise that has been built up by the excellent men and women who serve in those aspects of the RUC that have never been involved in any controversy. There are areas in which we can co-operate and I am sure they have been discussed by the Garda authorities. These matters have not been finalised but the Government is determined to have an <Col N="841" /> open mind on co-operation between both police forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for outlining the SDLP's position on policing issues that have yet to be resolved. Has the Government embraced these issues? The SDLP's line has always been against violence and its views on policing should have a strong resonance with all of us in the House. How are those views embraced in the discussions and how will they be advanced by the Government? As regards allowing a greater integration of different groups within the Garda Síochána, is the Taoiseach willing to examine the Irish language requirement with an open mind, to ensure that not only serving officers of the Northern Ireland police service but also minority groups within the Republic should not face any barriers to full involvement in policing in this jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever changes we succeed in making, our overriding aim is to keep as close as we can to the Patten Commission's report. We have adhered to its proposals since they were published in September 1999. Through all the discussions when the Bill was published last May, and in the first and second implementation plans, our mission was to make sure that we will have a fair, balanced and acceptable police service for everybody in Northern Ireland, regardless of what category, if any, they want to call themselves a part.</P>
      <P>Some other issues have been resolved in the course of discussions with the Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon. For as long as I have been in the political arena he has been talking about policing issues and has proposed many documents and made many presentations over the years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew he had been doing that since before I became a Member of this House. I am privileged to have spent hours on end listening to and sharing views with Mr. Mallon, long before I held this position, and no more so than in the six months leading up to the Good Friday Agreement. It is perhaps forgotten now that we could not fully resolve some issues in the agreement. Mr. Mallon had an enormous input to the chapters in the agreement, on pages 25 to 27, which set out the structures upon which we were to build. They moved on to form the Patten Commission, including a number of international figures, which formed the blueprint for where we are now. That was followed by legislation and the implementation plan which the Government supports. We have been endeavouring to do no more than what was in the Patten Commission report. As I have said here on a hundred occasions at Question Time, I never saw Patten as anything other than a balanced document bringing about &ndash; as the SDLP saw from the work it did &ndash; what <Col N="842" /> it was possible to do. Now we are trying to ensure we can make that work on the ground.</P>
      <P>No amount of legislation or implementation plans can detract from the experience people have. There are many personal views, based on much personal experience and knowledge, as to how this can work. Perhaps the devil is always in the detail but from that detail one has to make a balanced police service for Northern Ireland for the future that is fair to everybody, workable and that people can trust and join. Those are the important things and I have been endeavouring to do them in my work with the SDLP, Sinn Féin and any views we have picked up from any of the other parties. I have heard many views from the Ulster Unionist Party, which we have also tried to take account of. In the end, nobody will win or lose in this matter unless we have an acceptable police service in Northern Ireland with which everyone can feel happy. That has been the aim from day one and it continues to be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, in the High Court in Belfast, it was found that the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble, is acting unlawfully in refusing to nominate Sinn Féin Ministers to the All-Ireland Ministerial Council. Did the Taoiseach raise this matter in meetings with Mr. Trimble and Mr. Blair? Will he do so again in his meeting this evening with the British Prime Minister? Recognising that this is one of the pillars of the Good Friday Agreement dealing with issues of vital concern to people throughout this island, will the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister ensure that the All-Ireland Ministerial Council meetings that were cancelled will now go ahead with the full participation of all the relevant Ministers? </P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise with the British Prime Minister the activities of the British Army's force research unit? The latest revelations by a British soldier, carried on a television documentary last night, provide further evidence of the covert activities of the FRU and implicate that unit in six killings, including that of the human rights lawyer, Mr. Patrick Finucane, in which the RUC special branch is also implicated. Does the Taoiseach agree that truth and justice in these and many other cases involving British State killings and cover-ups, is absolutely essential, particularly in the context of the search for a new beginning in policing? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has noted yesterday's High Court decision by Mr. Justice Kerr which declared unlawful the First Minister's ban on Sinn Féin Ministers attending North-South Ministerial Council meetings. I can assure the Deputy that the judgment of the court will be studied carefully both by myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It clearly has implications for the operation of the North-South Ministerial Council and the wider political context. I understand that Mr. Trimble is likely to appeal the judgment and I do not want to make any detailed <Col N="843" /> comment on the matter until we see how that goes. The Government's view is that the present difficulties in the peace process are essentially political in nature and are best solved through political agreement and accommodation involving the pro-agreement parties. The Government will continue to work hard to try to bring that about.</P>
      <P>The second question raised by the Deputy related to the force research unit and the allegations about it and the &ldquo;Insight&rdquo; programme last evening. I am only too well aware of the serious allegations which have been reported over the past number of months regarding the collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces. This has been raised with us in many meetings by the CAJ and many other groups over the last number of years. These allegations emanate from the investigation of the murder of Pat Finucane in 1989, which deals with the role of the force research unit at that time. His murder is currently being investigated by the Stevens inquiry. That investigation is also dealing with the allegations of collusion. At a meeting this time last year with the Finucane family, I said it was our clear view that the case for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane was compelling and that a public inquiry needed to be established into all the circumstances surrounding the appalling murder. That remains the Government's position and I assure the Deputy and the House that we will continue to press the need for such an inquiry into the Finucane case and all the surrounding events. Of course, I have made similar cases regarding a number of other investigations over the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much agree with the Taoiseach's condemnation of the armed activities in County Cork and his request, or appeal, to other people to condemn such activities. Will he tell me what significance he reads into the fact that the Sinn Féin Member who has just spoken, Deputy Ó Caoláin, who represents the political wing of the republican movement, did not take that opportunity to condemn these armed activities even though they were not, or may not be, the responsibility of the Provisional IRA, although most people think they are? What significance is there in the fact he did not take up the offer to condemn such activities? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to policing, the Taoiseach is aware that I have always described that as the possible Achilles heel of a Northern settlement and that there will be no lasting solution to the Northern Ireland problem unless we have acceptable policing which young nationalists and young republicans can join. In those circumstances, does the Taoiseach agree that the SDLP, in particular, is being painted as being obdurate and intransigent? Does he agree it is worthwhile taking that risk in view of the importance of finding an acceptable solution to the policing problem and <Col N="844" /> in the recognition that if that is not found, the Good Friday Agreement could fall?</P>
    <P>In relation to Larne and Carrickfergus, does the Taoiseach agree it is absolutely appalling in 2001 that, not only are these sectarian activities going on in the area, but that they are allowed to go on? Will he explain what excuse has been made to him by the Northern authorities for the fact that in such a small area as Larne &ndash; we are not talking about remote isolated houses &ndash; where the RUC has the support of the majority of the community, these activities have not been brought to an end? What excuse have the security authorities in the North for that? If this is allowed to continue, extremist groups &ndash; there are, as we know, people on the republican side in that category &ndash; will say nothing has changed. What assurances has the Taoiseach received and what excuses have been made? </P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Currie about policing. It is vitally important and that was made very clear in the Good Friday Agreement. All I have said previously feeds into that. It is a key issue &ndash; to make sure we have an acceptable police service for the future which everyone can respect, look up to, support and join. It is not easy to achieve but that is a goal. Perhaps we will not change everything overnight but it is important, moving on from the Good Friday Agreement, Patten, the legislation and the implementation plan, to try to get everyone to help to develop this into the future. It is a key aspect and I think everyone in the House agrees with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Larne, Carrickfergus and other areas &ndash; although the focus recently has been on Larne and Carrickfergus &ndash; the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had meetings with the people involved. He had a meeting with Danny O'Connor and we have prepared, in conjunction with him, a detailed account, assessment and report on what has been happening on the ground. That has been, or is being, submitted to the authorities. Our staff have been on the ground and they have been to the homes of people who were attacked over the Christmas period. They have shown solidarity and have had meetings with the parish priest and the clergy involved. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has <Col N="845" /> secured a commitment that additional resources in terms of policing will be put into the area and that more attention will be paid to it. I am aware that the residents in the area are sceptical enough about that but we have to monitor that over a period of time and we will continue to do that.</P>

We all regard it as quite outrageous that citizens of any western democracy should live in the fear the people of Larne currently endure. They go to bed at night and do not know whether they will face fire bombs or pipe bombs. The net question asked by Deputy Currie was, what response has the Taosieach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs received in relation to the very direct net question, that is, how can that be tolerated or allowed to continue? </P>

      <P>Why is it beyond the ability of the security forces in Northern Ireland to give adequate protection to those citizens, which strikes all of us as bizarre and unacceptable?</P>
      <P>Earlier, in his comprehensive reply, the Taoiseach indicated that the next meeting of the British-Irish Council has been postponed. Has a date been fixed for the next meeting? How many meetings of the British-Irish Council have taken place to date? Why can the non-contentious political issues, originally envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement to be encompassed by the British-Irish Council such as issues of common concern at EU level like BSE and a range of other issues, not go ahead? Why is it necessary to postpone meetings of the British-Irish Council simply because there are political difficulties which can be addressed informally in the way they will be addressed tonight?</P>

      <P>I have already replied to the question on Larne but I would add that following the efforts by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State attended a meeting in Larne. To his credit, he met the local people and representatives in Larne and it was there he gave assurances of additional security for the area. I am sure he and the new Secretary of State, no more than ourselves, would be very concerned about what has happened there and in other places. We had a lot of this last summer in numerous places. There have been pipe bomb attacks, sectarian attacks and intimidation. I cannot recall the figure over the Christmas period but there was a high number of attacks on Nationalist and republican homes in these areas. That is a matter of grave concern. I think the Deputy heard the report himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent RTE programme showed the difficulties these people have had and that they are living in fear. It is good it is being focused here because the people in those areas did believe that if similar attacks were taking place elsewhere on <Col N="846" /> the island, there would be an enormous outcry. It will continue to be monitored and the Minister for Foreign Affairs is in close touch with the local people to continue to monitor that issue. The second question related to the British-Irish Council. A meeting was to take place on 23 January. We have few meetings though we have done quite an amount of work on the issues agreed early last year and the previous year. Both in the British-Irish Parliamentary Body and in these bodies there was some reluctance about people having meetings until we moved forward. We accepted that position but we are anxious to host these meetings. The next meeting here was to be on drugs which is not an unrelated issue for everybody in Northern Ireland or here.</P>

Given that the new Secretary of State, Dr. Reid, is of a Scottish background and we hope to see the North-South Ministerial Council up and running again <Col N="847" /> soon and given that the Taoiseach has voiced his support for the operation of strand three of the Agreement, using the acronym of IONA, islands of the North Atlantic, can he say whether he expects progress at an early stage on the Council of Isles idea?

        <b>:</b> I wish to express my extreme concern at the sectarian attacks directed, quite calculatedly at Catholic homes in Larne. Apart from the fear and terror it is only a matter of time, if this continues, when a pipe bomb will result in an atrocity of the scale of the Quinn children tragedy in previous times or something of that character? Will the Taoiseach acknowledge there have been some isolated attacks on Protestants as well and that all are to be equally condemned? Will the Taoiseach agree that these attacks would be deplored by the majority of ordinary people in both communities within Northern Ireland and have probably been carried out by isolated sectarian paramilitary groups or sections of certain paramilitaries? Will he agree they must be isolated? Like the Socialist Party will the Taoiseach urge the mobilisation on a cross-community basis of the two communities at ground level? Just as many trade unions have kept sectarianism out of the workplace, proactively so in the case of civil service unions, where thousands of workers mobilised against sectarian threats at the workplace and stopped them, will the Taoiseach agree that the trade unions, community organisations, youth clubs and so on, if mobilised, could isolate that small minority who are obviously attempting to stir up a sectarian conflagration? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Larne, will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs get an explanation from the British Government as to why in such a small area, irrespective of whether the attacks are on Catholics or Protestants &ndash; though a majority have been on Catholics &ndash; this situation is not containable? It is obvious the RUC have men whose commanders do not know how to use them. Why is that force not used to stop what is happening in Larne? What was the result of the Taoiseach's representations to the Republican movement in relation to the return to Northern Ireland of those who have been banished and how is that excusable in present circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Implementation Bodies, whatever about the full-time contracts all the Implementation Bodies are up and running. As Deputy Hayes will be aware, early last year there was a stop-start process which delayed some of the work. This should have moved on from Armagh in December 1999. In regard to the full-time positions there might be some delay. As far as the staffing and activities of the Bodies are concerned <Col N="848" /> they are up and running full time. Perhaps they have not been formalised but they were adequately staffed last year&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but the posts will have to be made full-time. To respond to Deputy Sargent's question, there was a successful meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Tier, attended by some Members, to move on the recommendations to bring in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. That will help. The co-ordinating group has already moved on those recommendations. Deputy Higgins raised the matter of sectarianism. We are talking about Larne but, as we found last year and every other year, sectarian attacks happened in both Catholic and Protestant areas. There were horrendous attacks on Protestants last year as well and we condemn all of them. As we move into springtime, summertime and the marching season, unfortunately it is clear from the statistics that these activities increase. All the work we can continue to do to help build cross-community co-operation is strongly supported by the Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has done that in terms of grant-aiding bodies on the Unionist and loyalist side. What we have done on some of the commemoration sites, including the site of the Battle of the Boyne, has helped build up co-operation. On Larne, to reiterate, we have received commitments from the Secretary of State and the previous Secretary of State. We will raise again tonight with the new Secretary of State the efforts to put more police in place. It is not for us to spell out here what they might do to stop this activity in some of these areas. It can apply in Nationalist areas at other times but in this case in Larne they would probably have some information on who is involved and why it has intensified. The RUC should be able to deal with these operational issues and that is what we have been pressing it to do.</P>

Responsibility for funding Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited transferred to my Department with effect from 1 January 2001. To date no moneys have been sought in respect of the project.

      <P>As I said last night, the cost of building Campus and Stadium Ireland is estimated at £550 million. In case I may have at any stage inadvertently misled the House, as has recently been pointed out, I may have said the cost of the stadium would be £281 million. If I have inadvertently misled the House I wish to correct that. The cost of the stadium is £51 million less than that figure. It will be £230 million. If the donation of £50 million by a private sector person is taken in to consideration, the cost of the stadium to the Exchequer will be £180 million. Over the last number of weeks others have speculated that the estimated cost will be much higher than this. I have heard figures bandied about like confetti at a wedding to the effect that the cost will be anything from £400 million to £500 million, £600 million, £750 million and £800 million. The figure of £900 million has been skipped for some reason and, conveniently, the figure of £1 billion has been mentioned and this week it has increased to £1.2 billion. I expect next week the suggested estimate will be in excess of that figure. The esti<Col N="850" /> mated cost to the Exchequer of the sports campus and stadium is £350 million.</P>

As in the debate last night, the Minister is full of wind and no substance. In arriving at an estimate of the cost is he factoring into the equation the £6.6 million spent on the development of the facilities at Abbotstown, the cost of relocating the facilities &ndash; will that be £150 million? &ndash; and the value of the land? Other developers must do this when developing a project. I ask the Minister to indicate the true cost of what is involved. Nobody is engaged in fabrication. The Minister is continuously misleading the House in the figures he is providing. He should now indicate the true figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen has little to do other than to elaborate on these types of questions. The State owns the 500 acres at Abbotstown. The Government is to proceed with its policy of decentralisation. There will be costs involved in this, no matter what aspects are considered. The Veterinary Research Laboratory is being transferred to County Kildare in conjunction with the required upgrading of its facilities, which are necessary in view of so much consumer concern over BSE, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the decentralisation programme has not yet been announced? The facilities at Abbotstown are being relocated purely for reasons of convenience to make way for the stadium. How can the Minister explain that this is part of the Government's decentralisation programme when it has been deferred until after the next election? For the third time will he answer the three specific statistical questions you, Sir, asked me to put?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct for any Opposition to ask questions about the cost of various projects. I have indicated the estimated cost to the Exchequer of Campus and Stadium Ireland. The Deputy would be surprised at the number of consortia that have submitted applications to build the complex. The number is in double figures. A large percentage wish to build the entire complex while others wish to build certain sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in trying to ensure that costs are kept at a minimum. The Government will ensure that. Over the last decades different Governments have paid lip service to sport. The estimated cost of the complex currently stands at £350 million. If it was to cost £0.5 billion or £1 <Col N="851" /> billion, the country needs such a sporting infrastructure. If £40 billion is to be spent on the national development plan then a cost of £0.5 billion will amount to 1.25% of the cost of the plan, which is a small percentage allocation to funding sport.</P>

      <P>Since the establishment of the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis on 1 July 1999, I have not issued any directive in relation to the withholding of grants from any specific sporting organisation. The structures of any particular body are a matter, of course, for that body and its constituent members. Responsibility for the provision of grant assistance to sporting bodies and persons now rests with the Sports Council. Consequently, the establishment of criteria, terms and conditions, including conditions relating to the structure of any grant aided organisation, for the awarding of financial assistance is a matter for the council in accordance with the terms of the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999.</P>

I do not ask the Minister to intervene in the ordinary day to day work of the Sports Council, but will he give a directive that grants will be paid only to organisations which are clearly and demonstrably democratic in their operations? Does he agree that the answer he gave to my question on 16 November 2000 indicated he would do that?</P>

      <P>I confirm that I have given such a directive to the Sports Council. I met with the Olympic Council of Ireland and put this point to its president, Mr. Pat Hickey. I pointed out to him that I had reservations about the democracy of that organisation. He responded with his own ideas. I have clearly indicated to the Sports Council that if it is not satisfied that there is no democratic process in these organisations it should be bound to withdraw and withhold funding from them.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. What he has done is an important step forward in terms of bringing order and harmony to the whole area of sport. However, where an organisation applies for a grant and it is not democratic at the time of applying, does the Minister con<Col N="852" /> sider that the Sports Council should give it the opportunity to introduce democratic structures so that it could avail of funding? I am not seeking that the Olympic Movement be penalised but, if there is a difficulty with the democracy element, it should be addressed.</P>

It was pointed out by the Olympic Council that some organisations have exactly the same structures as they do. I responded that they too have questions to answer regarding the democracy of how they are formed. I agree with everything the Deputy said. Making available grants is the only way the Minister has of ensuring the policies are carried out in a fair and meaningful manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, included a provision towards the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates. An open tender competition was launched by Bord Fáilte in September 1997 and the successful tender was from Spencer Dock Consortium Limited for its proposed conference centre at Spencer Dock in Dublin's Docklands. In November 1998, the European Commission gave its approval, in principle, for the offer of a grant of 33 million ECU, £26 million to the successful tenderer subject to a number of conditions, including the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State aids rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, having secured EU Commission confirmation on permissible time limits for the grant drawdown, contract documentation was agreed and signed by Bord Fáilte and the developer, Spencer Dock Consortium Limited by end December 1999. The deadline set for drawdown of the grant was 31 December 2002, with major construction work to be under way by January 2001. Planning permission for the development, issued by Dublin Corporation in August 1999, was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Last July, An Bord Pleanála issued its decision granting planning permission for the national conference centre element of the overall development but not for the bulk of the surrounding development. <Col N="853" /> Since then, the developers have been considering their options in light of this planning decision. Options, of which I have been made aware, would require the provision of substantial additional public funding over and above the terms of the original grant offer from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Following consultations with Bord Fáilte and advice from the Attorney General, I consider that I am precluded from introducing any amendments to the public procurement process through which the Spencer Dock proposal emerged and the grant offer of £26 million was made. I have informed the developers accordingly and asked them to continue to consider with Bord Fáilte how to proceed within the context of the terms and conditions of the existing grant offer. As we are now at the end of January 2001, I expect Bord Fáilte to be in contact with the developers to confirm their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On taking office, the first act of the Minister was to scrap the plans for the national conference centre in Ballsbridge. His second act was to give a commitment that one of his priorities during his term of office would be the building of a national conference centre for which tourism chiefs were crying out. In view of what the Minister said, when does he expect a conference centre to be built and operational in this city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already said, when I came into office the entire conference centre was already off the rails and we were in danger of losing the £26 million EU grant. That is the reason we had this current competition. There have been difficulties in relation to planning permission. However, An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission for the construction of the conference centre but, unfortunately, not for the development surrounding it.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, the Government is firmly committed to the conference centre. This is 31 January, the last day for dealing with this aspect of the contract. I have asked Bord Fáilte to draw up a report of the intended plans within seven days. As this is the last day for dealing with the contract, I am sure Deputies will understand that I do not wish to discuss what might be liabilities or entitlements to the two parties involved. I have asked Bord Fáilte to draw up a report within the next seven days as to what exactly is the situation between the two parties at this stage.</P>

      <P>In 2000, under my Department's sports capital programme, applications for grants amounting to £183,301,876 were received in respect of projects with a total value of £382,995,422. I allocated a total of £36 million under the programme to 679 projects throughout the country, which was an increase from £20 million in 1999 and £6 million in 1998. The allocation under the 2000 sports capital programme is double the total amount of £18 million given by the previous Government over three years from 1995-97.</P>
      <P>The allocations made under the 2000 sports capital programme includes almost £26 million to community and voluntary groups throughout the country towards the provision of local sport and recreational facilities, £7.5 million to local authorities towards the provision of major facilities, including a national indoor athletic training facility at Morton Stadium, Santry, to complement the existing outdoor athletics stadium and £2.35 million to a range of county GAA and FAI grounds throughout the country.</P>

Will he accept that my figure of £857 million was the value of projects that applied for grants last year, of which he allocated £36 million, and that the £745 million was the value of projects rejected to almost 1,000 clubs? Will he confirm these figures are correct? Given that they are correct, will he balance the needs of clubs and organisations throughout the country with the vast investment he will undertake for the national stadium? He conceded here today that the project could cost <Col N="855" /> up to £1 billion and that, if it does, what harm? Will the Minister accept this is the scale of demand throughout the country and will he confirm the figures I am producing are accurate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I want initially to correct Deputy Allen. I stated categorically that the estimated cost to the taxpayer of the Sports Campus and Stadium Ireland was £550 million, of which £350 million will be required from the Exchequer. I stand by that figure. I do not know from where the Deputy obtained a figure of £857 million. However, the total cost of projects in the year 2000 was approximately £383 million and 697 projects were allocated funding. I return to the point that the average grant given to any project is £53,000. The Deputy, when serving as a Minister of State, scattered grants around like snuff at a wake and the average grant given during his tenure was between £10,000 and £15,000. He should recognise that it would take an ordinary community a lengthy period to raise £53,000.</P>
      <P>In 2000 I allocated funding to 697 projects while 416 projects were given grants in the previous year. I was approached by representatives &ndash; many of them Members of this House &ndash; from each of these projects and we tried to prioritise matters to allow them to commence. All of those involved in the projects to which I refer promised that they would ensure that their work commenced and was duly completed. We had not done badly by the end of 1999, but we still managed to return between £4 million and £5 million. As we increase the number of projects to which we provide funding, the number of projects that fall by the wayside also increases because they are not able to employ the relevant developers or contractors to allow the work to proceed. In 2000, £36 million was allocated by the Department and, as already stated, all of this will not be used.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to fund local and small organisations, including GAA, rugby and soccer clubs, etc. However, that issue is separate to that which involves the funding of the national stadium. We are not diverting funding to the national stadium that would otherwise be given to these organisations. The smaller organisations to which I am giving the funding are unable to spend it. This is mainly due to the fact that there are not enough developers or contractors interested in doing jobs valued at £100,000, £200,000 or £300,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that most of the projects which cannot be commenced are not inhibited because those involved cannot find contractors, but because applicants who applied for £15,000 or £16,000 received an average of approximately £20,000 or £25,000 and the con<Col N="856" /> tracts cannot proceed because of the major shortfall between the cost of projects and the grant allocated?

We have given grants amounting to £27 million and £36 million and £117 million will be spent this year. It is not for lack of funding, it is because there is a statutory requirement that each organisation must obtain either 20% to 30% of the money, depending on whether they are located in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is taking to deal with the serious labour shortages in the hotel and catering industry.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The successful development of tourism in recent years has created new challenges for the industry, not only in terms of maintaining its competitive position internationally but as regards competition for staff in a labour market where skills and shortages have become a major issue for all economic sectors, including tourism. This situation requires new and innovative responses from the industry and from State institutions.</P>
      <P>For its part CERT, following extensive research and consultation with industry, launched a new strategic plan for the period 2000-06. This is designed to deliver the objectives and programmes set out in the national development plan and involves a shift in the focus of the organisation, with an enhanced emphasis on promoting human resource management capability in the industry, and researching and benchmarking best practice. The industry will need smarter recruitment and retention programmes and innovative ways of increasing productivity if it is to maintain its pool of highly motivated, productive and committed skilled labour to respond to market demand for quality service and value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has agreed to allocate £107 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to CERT to help industry secure and retain a professional and skilled work force to meet existing and emerging needs in the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of tourism product and service. In this context, more than £16 million has been provided in my Departmental Estimates for allocation to CERT in 2001 to enable the <Col N="857" /> organisation to commence the implementation of its new strategic plan.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that CERT has continued with its many initiatives designed to promote careers in the industry to the school leaving population generally. These include workshops for career guidance counsellors, a telephone careers information line, circulation of careers information to more than 1,400 schools, FÁS offices, libraries, and youth organisations, and the preparation of information packs for industry personnel giving career talks.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures outlined, two parallel initiatives are designed to further promote careers in the industry. The first of these, which was launched in October 2000, was CERT's annual careers roadshow, which visited 16 venues nationwide and held more than 70 sessions in various second level institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>It was targeted at second level students from transition year to leaving certificate level and was implemented in partnership with the major industry bodies, including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants' Association of Ireland, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners' Association. It was widely advertised through local radio stations and newspapers.</P>
    <P>The second initiative was the launch of the careers magazine <i>Get a Life in Tourism</i>. This magazine is a CERT joint venture with the industry bodies and highlights the variety of careers on offer in the sector. The numbers enrolling in tourism entry courses were maintained for the 2000-01 academic year, despite stiff competition from other industries and educational courses.</P>
    <P>CERT is currently undertaking a pilot programme targeted at long-term unemployment blackspots which has proved to be very popular and successful, with exceptionally good job prospects for participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses. The programme which is currently under way in Ballymun, Clondalkin and Merchant's Quay is to be extended to Waterford during 2001 and will be replicated in other parts of the country which have experienced particularly high levels of long-term unemployment. CERT's new nationwide programme to encourage people who have been out of the work force for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry has been running for nearly a year at this stage. It has proved extremely successful to date and it is projected that 6,000 adults will complete this programme by 2005.</P>
    <P>In a separate effort to boost recruitment levels, I understand tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Scotland and Wales which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland. Recruitment drives are currently being considered for other European locations. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS, who welcome employers to such recruitment drives. I understand the Irish Hotels Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual bodies are <Col N="858" /> also participating in EURES, the European employment service, to help satisfy labour shortages in the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>To help address concerns in the tourism and hospitality industry in relation to recruitment and staff retention, CERT launched the new RETAIN initiative in the latter part of 2000. Under this initiative, financial assistance of up to £15,000 over a three year period will be available, under certain conditions, to businesses for improvement in human resources management. Alongside the new scheme, CERT will run a series of courses for owners and general managers on modern human resource best practice.</P>
    <P>In a significant shift in the direction of support for the industry, CERT held a major conference on world class service in tourism and hospitality for general managers and senior executives in the industry in Dublin Castle in November, 2000. Featuring a panel of international speakers and the findings of the latest international research carried out during 2000, the conference focused on best practice in human resources and operations management. It was attended by 150 of the key decision-makers from among Ireland's leading tourism industry enterprises.</P>
    <P>One of the key findings to emerge from the report &ldquo;Hospitality Best Practice &ndash; A Benchmark Study&rdquo;, was the requirement for the tourism industry to improve its performance significantly. It emerged from the study that success will only come from focusing on customer needs, and fully engaging employees in meeting those needs. In response to these findings, CERT proposes to work more closely with the industry in a number of areas specifically designed to improve operational performance. CERT is planning a number of management development initiatives to assist this process and is working with Excellence Ireland to develop a business excellence recognition scheme to promote the attainment of excellence within the industry and to provide a necessary framework within which management and staff can work towards higher levels of performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed because we have heard all this before. I have raised the question of human resources and the reduction in the supply of people to this part of the work force on numerous occasions. The Government has failed dismally to increase the attraction of the workplace to people from overseas and at home. There is major potential for development in this area. What is the Minister doing with regard to the provision of a detailed, all-encompassing national immigration policy which will include the granting of work visas and business permissions through the medium of procedures that are simple, speedy and transparent? Nothing has been done in this regard. In addition, nothing has been done in respect of the granting of a low income subsidy to support those who will not benefit from the tax relief measures relating to child care. I am closely involved with the industry <Col N="859" /> and those involved in it are crying out for assistance.</P>
      <P>Due to the change in the nature of the skills required and the need to provide additional training, what action has been taken in respect of granting tax credits for approved or pre-defined employer-led training? The answer is nothing. The Minister has referred to the national development plant on numerous occasions when replying to my questions. He waves the plan around like a magic wand. Will I be in a position tomorrow to inform an employer who is seeking to employ additional staff that changes will be made? I met representatives of CERT last week and they informed me that they face an impossible task. The Minister is not dealing with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, as in other sectors, there are problems in this sector. Last year the Tánaiste's office issued 20,000 work permits. It is not the responsibility of Government to take the industry by the hand and spoon feed it grants. About 60% of hotels and 80% of restaurants have no in-house training budget. There owners do not want to do anything, they want the State to train their staff for them. Why are these hotels and restaurants not carrying out their own in-house training and why is the State obliged to continually take people by the hand and give them grants?</P>
      <P>There is no question that there is a labour shortage. CERT has been doing everything in its power to deal with this problem. For example, there has been a national tourism careers roadshow, we have launched <i>Get a Life in Tourism</i>, there have been school talks and exhibitions, guidance counsellor branch meetings have been held, information brochures and application forms have been published and we have advertised to try to attract people to enter the industry. The industry suffered from an image problem in the past, but, thankfully, we are overcoming that difficulty at present. We are trying to encourage increasing numbers of young people to become involved in the industry. The introduction of the minimum wage has created great potential for those entering this industry.</P>

      <P>The proposals brought to Government aim to address these concerns, particularly regarding the involvement of local partnership companies in the delivery structure, while also ensuring that those charged with expenditure and the provision of facilities and services have the scope to act quickly and deliver an accelerated programme of investment in these communities.

      <P>The Irish Sports Council, which is statutorily responsible for implementation of <Col N="862" /> actions to combat doping in sport, inaugurated the national sports anti-doping programme in November 1999. The programme has been designed with reference to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, which seeks a three-strand approach to the reduction of doping in sport, namely, testing, research and educational programmes and information campaigns. The convention is informed by the International Olympic Council's list of banned classes and methods of doping. This list, which is recognised by virtually all international sports federations, including non-Olympic sports, stems from sport itself but does not include creatine.</P>

      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy's comments on the use of creatine. On every possible occasion we in this House have pointed out that there has not been enough research on creatine. This substance is commonly used by young athletes in schools but is not on the international list of banned substances.</P>
      <P>I have stated that I intend to bring the research referred to by the Deputy to the attention of the sports council and I have no doubt it will strongly recommend that we add this substance to the list of banned substances. However, there is a difficulty. The Deputy is aware that I included anabolic steroids and a number of other drugs within the remit of the Misuse of Drugs Act so it is a criminal offence to be in possession of such drugs. However, creatine is causing problems.</P>
      <P>There is not enough research on this substance and I have stated that those using creatine will be the laboratory guinea pigs of tomorrow. The Deputy has pointed out a serious matter and we have to take into account the more recent research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the seriousness and <Col N="863" /> urgency of the situation, instead of seeking a recommendation from the Irish Sports Council, will the Minister immediately introduce, in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Children, a nationwide education programme? In conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will he also consider legislation or regulations to ban creatine? There is now a major question mark over this substance. It is being used in some of the major sporting schools but we are doing nothing about it. I raised this matter over 12 months ago and, if my memory is correct, I received the same response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points. Creatine has been mentioned on quite a number of occasions. I have always indicated it is a substance in respect of which we do not have research. No legislation is required to ban it, that could be done by way of a ministerial order. I have included five or six drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Creatine could be such a substance, if it were permissible to do that, but it is currently available over the counter. Unless adequate research is carried out into a substance, it cannot be removed from circulation &ndash; a legal case could be brought against us for doing that &ndash; unless we have the necessary back up research to support such a decision. Second, as regards an education programme, I could discuss that with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a major French agency has issued a warning statement on the use of creatine, will the Minister introduce a regulation to ban its use rather than let a situation develop where we would be sorry after the event, in view of the potential catastrophic effect it will have on young people in later life? We still do not know what the fallout from its use will be. We are only guessing, but the danger signs are there and they have been presented to us by the French agency. I ask the Minister to introduce a regulation to ban the use of that substance.</P>

      <P>I will see what I can do. As the Deputy is aware, an anti-doping committee was set up in September. It is chaired by Dr. Conor O'Brien and its membership comprises leading experts in the fields of medicine, law, pharmacology and administration. One of its members is Michele Verroken who is head of the UK's sports council anti-doping and education unit. I will raise this matter with the anti-doping committee and we will consider what can be done in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, the Government allocated £10 million to support the implementation of measures contained in the action plans prepared by the local drugs task forces. More than 200 projects were supported to deliver a range of interventions under the themes of prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation and supply reduction.</P>
      <P>In 1998, an independent evaluation of the drugs initiative commissioned by my Department found that the local drugs task forces had achieved a considerable degree of success in the short time since their establishment, not least in reducing the feelings of frustration and isolation previously felt by many communities in the affected areas.</P>
      <P>On foot of this evaluation and a subsequent review of the task forces by the national drugs strategy team, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion approved further funding of £15 million to enable the task forces to update their drug action plans. To date, seven plans have been submitted to the national drugs strategy team for assessment. It is expected that the remainder will be submitted over the next few months and that the new plans will commence operation during 2001.</P>
      <P>Over the course of last year, more than 140 task force projects were independently evaluated with a view to mainstreaming those considered to be achieving their aims and objectives. In this context, mainstreaming means the projects will continue to be funded through a relevant State agency, in line with agreed procedures that protect their ethos. More than 120 projects were recommended for mainstream funding at an annual cost of approximately £8.7 million</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that I am currently overseeing the finalisation of a major review of the overall national drugs strategy which will identify any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new structures through which to deliver them. It is expected the review, which includes the role of the local drugs task forces, will be ready for submission to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and subsequently to Cabinet within the coming month or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are dealing with questions on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I will confine my question to the task forces whose terms of reference provide for preventative programmes, in other words, those that use sport and recreation as preventative elements in the fight against drugs. Has the Minister gathered evidence from the evaluation reports he received that the use of sport and recreation in deprived areas has been successful in reducing the level of drugs in those areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question. Having regard to the local drugs task forces, the young people's facilities and services fund and grants given by my ministerial colleague, Deputy <Col N="865" /> McDaid, the answer to the Deputy's question is yes. One of the positive aspects of the new plans is that the emphasis in them seems to be more on prevention as opposed to the treatment of people, which was more the emphasis in the original plans. While we have only had sight of seven plans and agreed three, the plans from Cork, Ballymun and Dublin 12, at the Cabinet committee on social inclusion this afternoon, the emphasis in them seems to be on education and prevention elements. I am sure the national drugs strategy team would consider the committee is moving in the right direction. Sport and recreation activities are one way of keeping people in many of these communities away from the problem of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sports facilities and the young people's facilities and services fund, the drugs task forces would consider they are part of the way forward and without such diversions from the world of drugs matters would be disastrous for young people. Is the Minister of State aware that some of the task forces, specifically the task force in the Cabra area, have submitted proposals for funding for a major complex in John Paul Park to provide the community with a sporting complex that would provide training, education and sporting facilities for young people there? The Minister is aware of that proposal, as I have spoken to him on several occasions about it. The local community has been waiting two years for approval of adequate funding for that proposed complex. It have raised a great deal of money, the corporation has provided a site and plans are ready to start the work, yet the local community is still awaiting the additional funding required to get that project under way. That is the position in an area that has had a very serious drugs problem. Has the Minister of State any good news on this project for the young people of Cabra in Dublin 7? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister of State's reply to my supplementary, has he a breakdown of the expenditure to date in this area? If so, what percentage of the funding has been allocated to sport and recreation activities? While a good deal of money has been allocated to the statutory bodies dealing with the task forces, I am concerned that much of it has been absorbed into mainstream activities by the statutory bodies rather than allocated to the communities directly involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An evaluation has been carried out. I do not have a breakdown of the allocation of the moneys, but I could try to get that for the Deputy. In many cases the local communities want the projects to be mainstreamed as they consider that would mean they would be established on a more permanent footing. Local communities were anxious that we mainstreamed many of these projects and even if they are mainstreamed, they can still retain their ethos. It would be against the spirit of our objective if they <Col N="866" /> were to be financed by a Department and were then to revert to where they were originally. It was felt that Departments and State agencies were not responding to community needs on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>With regard to Deputy Gregory's question, which is slightly off the agenda of the question tabled, there is a major shortfall in the project he mentioned. His constituency colleague, the Taoiseach, is as anxious as the Deputy about this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The results of Bord Fáilte's surveys of overseas travellers indicate that perceptions of overall value for money in Ireland improved significantly among visitors from the British and US markets in 2000, and this appears to be due primarily to the strength of sterling and the dollar. Most forecasts suggest that the euro will strengthen over the next few years against both the dollar and sterling. The expected improvement in the value of the euro will mean that Ireland, together with the other euro zone countries, will appear to be more expensive as there will be an erosion of relative competitiveness for US and British visitors. However, I understand that Bord Fáilte considers it unlikely that the current exchange movements will impact significantly on the 2001 season. On the other hand, I understand from Bord Fáilte that a recent survey suggests that the Irish tourism industry and the hotel sector, in particular, have experienced price increases above the general levels of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a recent Irish Tourist Industry Confederation dinner, I referred to this worrying trend and underlined the importance of all economic operators taking appropriate measures to maintain and improve competitiveness. I referred to the constructive exchange of views which I had with <Col N="867" /> ITIC on this subject last summer during which I highlighted the need to keep prices as low as possible and to take other initiatives to improve marketing and human resource management to increase our international competitiveness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that despite the weakness of the euro and the punt versus sterling last year that our tourist figures from the UK were relatively stagnant when one sees the growth in numbers from elsewhere? Will the Minister explain how he can have confidence in UK tourist figures for this year when those figures were so weak last year in a favourable economic climate?</P>
      <P>In addition, will the Minister do something about tourists and Irish people being ripped off by the service industry? We have seen an increase of 10p to 12p in the price of drink recently and no matter where one goes in the restaurant sector there have been massive increases that are totally out of line with inflation. Is there any communication between the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, on this matter? We are pricing ourselves out of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of concern to us that we could be pricing ourselves out of the market. It is outrageous that the price of drink can be increased by 10p to 12p with a click of the fingers. I understand that this occurred mostly in Dublin and that only 6% of public houses elsewhere put up their prices.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned the price of food in restaurants in the past and all these matters will come back to haunt us one day if we are not careful. We should remember the adage about killing the goose that lays the golden egg. The Taoiseach asked each Minister to bring in industry representatives from his or her sector to talk to them about the dangers of inflation. The main reason we had to do so related to the high prices being charged. There is room for improvement but there was an increase of 5%.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in that the biggest problem I see is overcharging. I may be giving my age away but I worked in a bank when decimalisation was introduced and I saw that prices were levelled up, not down. Individuals will do so again. Will the Minister introduce regulations to penalise those who overcharge? This will have to be policed and the Minister's Department could do so in the tourism industry.</P>

      <P>Beidh sé ag dul ar aghaidh ar feadh tamaill. Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an leasú in alt 4, mar a bhí á rá agam roimh an sos. Sé sin nach gá do iarrthóirí a bheith in a gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht chun teach a thógáil ach go mbeadh siad in a gcónaí sa teach sula n-íocfaí an deontas. An dara rud ná an méadú atá ar an deontas feabhsúcháin ó £2, 300 go dtí £4,000. Cuirim fáilte roimhe sin mar tá costas oibre agus gach saghas costais ag dul in áirde. Sílim gur an-chuidiú é sin. Ar ndóigh, go fóill níl aon mholadh nó nil aon trácht sa Bhille ar an deontas a ardú. Tá sé £4,000 is dócha ar feadh &ndash; b'fheidir 12 bliana nó 15 bliana, agus tá fhios againn uilig, go bhfuil luach tithíochta ag dul in áirde. Bheadh sé ina chuidiú agus in a spreagadh mór do dhaoine óga sa Ghaeltacht dá mbeadh an deontas níos áirde ná £4,000. Má tá tú ag tógáil tí ar oileán anois tá sé sílim £12,000 agus is maith an rud é sin. Tá deacrachtaí speisialta ag na hoileánaigh le costais bunábhair a thabhairt isteach agus cuidíonn sé an costas sin a íoc. Mar sin féin, sílim gur mór an trua é nach bhfuil árdú ar bith ar dheontas do theach nua sa Ghaeltacht féin. Is cuimhin liom 20 nó 30 bliana ó shin go raghadh an deontas píosa fada chun teach a thógáil &ndash; sé sin, nuair a bhí cead ag na daoine féin an obair a dhéanamh. Má bhí tí ábalta tógáil a dhéanamh tú féin d'fhéadfá do chuid oibre féin a dhéanamh agus ní raibh le cheannach agat ach an t-ábhar. Go minic bhí an deontas ábalta 50% nó níos mó ná sin de chostas an tí a ghlanadh nuair a bhí do chuid oibre féin san áireamh. Anois caithfidh tú conraitheoirí cláraithe a fhostú. Tá an t-abhar i bhfad níos daoire ná mar a bhí agus is beag an céatadán de chostas iomlán an tí atá an £4,000 a chuirtear ar fáil. Sílim gur chóir breathnú ar sin agus árdú suntasach a chur ar an deontas sin.</P>
      <P>In alt 13 chím go bhfuiltear ag cur deireadh leis an deontas don dara theach. Tá sé sin curtha ar cheal ar fad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sílim gur mór an trua é sin. Bhí sé curtha ar cheal ar feadh roinnt blianta agus tugadh ar ais é ceithre nó cúig bliana ó shin ach tá sé á chur ar cheal arís anois. Tá ceantair Ghaeltachta go fóill agus níl caighdeán na tithíochta thar mholadh <Col N="870" /> beirte ionntu agus d'fhéadfadh tithe úra a bheith de dhíth ar theaghlaigh a bhfuil tithe acu cheana féin. Tá súil agam go mbreathnófar ar sin. Tá tithe sa Ghaeltacht atá céad bliain d'aois nó níos mó agus droch bhall orthu. Má tá daoine mar sin chun teach úr a thógáil bhéinn ag súil go mbeadh an deontas iníoctha leo sin i gcónaí. An mar sin a bheidh an scéal?</P>

Go minic bím féin agus Teachtaí eile i dteangbháil leis an Roinn faoi chinnithe maidir le hiarratais ar dheontais. Anois is arís bíonn sé deacair glacadh leis an gcinneadh a déantar. An bhfuil aon slí ann gur féidir athscrúdú a dhéanamh má déantar cinneadh gan an deontas a cheadú? Cé dhéanann an t-athscrúdú? Má chuireann tú iarratas isteach ar liúntas de chineál éigin go dtí an Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh agus má dhéantar tú a dhiúltiú tá cead agat athchomhairc a dhéanamh. Cuirtear oifigeach eile amach chun athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar an chás iomlán. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé sin ag Roinn na Gaeltachta chomh maith. Tá fhios agam go bhfuil fhios ag an Aire agus ag na hoifigigh goidé go díreach a bhfuil mé ag tagairt dó. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh deis ag daoine athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar iarratais ar dheontais a diúltaíodh agus go mbeadh duine neamhspleách ann chun an t-athscrúdú a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Ta roinnt cásanna a bhfuil eolas pearsanta agam féin orthu, daoine a thóg tithe sa Ghaeltacht, chuir siad isteach ar dheontas Gaeltachta agus diúltaíodh dóibh ar chúis amháin nó ar chúis eile. B'fhéidir de bharr teanga nó rud éigin mar sin. Ansin nuair a chuir siad isteach ar dheontas don Roinn Comhshaoil fuair siad amach go raibh an t-achar thar an rud atá ceadaithe &ndash; 125 méadar cearnach.  Mar sin tá daoine fágtha gan aon deontas chun teach a thógáil.  Níor cháiligh siad faoi cheann Roinn na Gaeltachta &ndash; an ceann a bhí ar intinn acu &ndash; mar bhí easnamh éigin ann, agus nuair a chuaigh siad go dtí an Roinn Comhshaoil bhí an teach ró-mhór agus níor éirigh leo deontas de chineál ar bith a fháil. Bhí cásanna mar sin sa Ghaeltacht san am atá caite agus is dóigh go bhfuil sé ag tarlú go fóill.  Níl fhios agam ar tháinig aon athrú ar an riail sin nó ar an deacracht sin a fhuascailt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí scéimeanna sa Ghaeltacht sna seascaidí seallaithe saoire a thógáil in aice leis an teach cónaithe. Bhíodh siad sin á n-úsáid ag cuairteoirí i rith an tsamhraidh. Le blianta anuas anois tá úsáid eile á bhaint as na seallaithe sin. Nuair a d'fhás an clann suas is minic a chuaigh duine acu chun cónaithe sa sealla agus teallach acu féin anois. Níl na seallaithe sin ró-mhór agus de réir mar a thuigim nuair a chuirtear feabhas ar shealla mar sin, díon nó dóirse nó fuinneoga nua, nó má <Col N="871" /> chuirtear píosa leis &ndash; agus is tithe teallaigh cuid de na seallaithe seo &ndash; ní cháilíonn siad fá choinne deontas feabhsaithe. Ba chóir go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú ar na cásanna sin, go mbeadh siad cáilithe le haghaidh deontais go speisialta más príomh theach don teallach atá sa sealla i láthair na huaire. Tógadh do chuairteoirí iad ach anois tá teallaigh Ghaeltachta in a gcónaí ionntu.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil sé ar intinn sa Bhille scéim deontais a cheadú do thithe ceann tuí. Is dóigh go dtagann sé sin faoin gnáth scéim feabhsúcháin. Chomh fada agus is eol dom tá scéim deontais den chineál céanna ag an Roinn Comhshaoil. Níl fhios agam cad é an comparáid atá idir é seo agus ceann Roinn na Gaeltachta nó ciacu is fearr.</P>

      <P>Tá lúcháir orm é sin a chloisint.</P>
      <P>Is minic a líon mé isteach foirm iarratais agus cuireadh in iúl nach deontas a bhí á lorg ach iasacht. Níor thuig mé riamh an scéim seo go bhfuair tú iasacht chomh maith le deontas le teach a thógáil nó teach a dheisiú sa Ghaeltacht. Níl fhios agam cad é an úsáid a bhí á bhaint as an scéim sin nó ar chuir mórán daoine isteach ar iasachtaí. Ach tugadh mórán iasachtaí agus sílim gur seo droch am le deireadh a chur leis an scéim. Mar tá níos mó feidhme le h-iasachtaí anois mar go bhfuil costas na dtithe, na hoibre agus an ábhair imithe suas níos aoirde ná mar a bhí riamh.</P>
      <P>Níl fhios agam an bhfuil mórán daoine ag baint úsáid as nó cad é uas-mhéid an iasachta a bhí ar fáil ach mar sin féin cuireann sé íontas orm go bhfuil an gné áirithe den scéim sin á chur ar cheal ag an am seo.</P>
      <P>Mar sin féin, ar a laghad is fiú fáilte a chur roimh an Bille. Bhíomar ag fanacht leis le tamall fada. Tá cúpla rud fiúntach ann. Tá go leor rudaí eile go bhféadfaí a chur ann agus is dóca gurb é an ceann is tábhachtaí ná méid an deontais a ardú. Tuigim gur féidir é a dhéanamh amach anseo gan reachtaíocht a thógaint isteach, sé sin go mbeadh sé de chead ag an Aire nó ag an Roinn é a ardú de réir mar is mian leo.</P>
      <P>Ach é sin ráite agam cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille agus is dóigh go rachaidh sé chun socair do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chomh fada agus a théann sé.</P>

Mar a deireann an meamram míniúcháin, is é an cuspóir ghinearálta atá leis an mBille ná leasú agus leathnú a dhéanamh ar achtanna na dtithe Gaeltachta cun iad a dhéanamh níos oiriúnaí don saol atá inniu ann. Cuireadh san áireamh chomh maith cinnithe a déanadh le gairid le cúnamh atá ar fáil faoi na hachtanna.</P>

    <P>Ag féachaint ar na figiúirí a chuir an tAire Stáit os comhair an Tí nuair a bhí an díospóireacht ar siúl ag tús an dara chéim, dúirt an tAire Stáit Hanafin gur caitheadh £1.55 milliún faoin scéim i 1999. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an figiúr ag an Aire Stáit ó Cuív anois don bhliain seo caite. Dúirt an tAire <Col N="872" /> Stáit Hanafin freisin go raibh méadú 14%ar an airgead a caitheadh i gcomparáid le 1998. Sa bhliain 1999 fuarathas 1,048 iarratas faoin scéim agus b'shin méadú 31% ar líon na n-iarratas i 1998. Figiúr a bhfuil mé roinnt sásta leis ná gur críochnaíodh 127 teach maraon le 707 cás a bhain le hoibreacha feabhsúcháin. Ba mhaith liom na figiúirí céanna don bhliain 2000 a fháil ón Aire Stáit má tá siad aige, agus líon na n-oibreacha feabhsúchfáin maraon leis sin. Rud eile a ba mhaith go dtabharfadh an tAire Stáit míniú air freisin ná an riail nua sa Bhille seo nach gcaithfidh duine a bheith ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht an fad is atá a theach á thógáil. An mbaineann sé sin le Gaeilgeoirí atá ag filleadh ar an nGaeltacht agus le Gaeilgeoirí nach raibh cónaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht cheana agus atá ag iarraidh cur futhu anois?</P>
    <P>Tagann an fhadhb mar gheall ar theorainneacha na Gaeltachta isteach i m'aigne maidir leis an riail nua seo. Tá sé á rá ag an Aire Stáit le fada go bhfuil scéim ar intinn aige chun cáilíocht teangan a cheapadh do na Gaeltachtaí éagsúla agus muna dtiocfadh ceantar áirithe suas go dtí an caighdeán go mbeadh roinnt ama acu an caighdeán a shroichint le go dtabharfaí Gaeltacht orthu arís. Ach tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh reachtaíocht den tsórt seo ann don Ghaeltacht. Luaigh an tAire Stáit ina óráid an reachtaíocht tithíochta go dtí seo, i 1929, 1979 agus anuraidh. Chonacthas bearnaí an-mhóra eatarthu. B'fhéidir gur fíor sin faoi an-chuid a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá coimisiún ar bun anois don Ghaeltacht ach nílim sásta nach eol dúinn cathain a bheidh críoch leis an obair seo agus na moltaí ar fáil le gur féidir leis an Aire cinneadh a ghlacadh ina dtaobh. Léiríonn na bearnaí móra an easpa spéise a bhí ag an Stáit i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta sa fichiú haois. Tá feabhas tagtha ar chúrsaí anois ach táimid le fada ag fanacht ar an bpíosa reachtaíochta seo chun leathnú agus leasú a dhéanamh ar an reachtaíocht go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist theorainneacha na Gaeltachta rí-thábhachtach. Baineann na scéimeanna seo leis an nGaeltacht mar atá leagtha síos faoi Acht na nAirí agus na Rúnaithe (Leasú) 1956. Tá a fhios ag an saol agus ag an Aire Stáit nach féidir Gaeltacht a thabhairt ar chuid de na ceantair Ghaeltachta a thuilleadh. Tá sé thar am rud a dhéanamh faoi seo agus ní fheicim go bhfuil an obair seo idir láimhe go fóill.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an deontas don teas lárnach agus mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit tá sé seo an-tábhachtach do sheandaoine. Fáiltím freisin roimh an athrú go bhfuil an tréimhse feithimh seacht mbliana idir dheontais á chur ar ceal sa chás seo. Cabhróidh sé freisin le tithe a chur in oiriúint do mhic léinn i rith an tsamhraidh.</P>
    <P>An bhfuil sé ceadaithe faoin reachtaíocht seo do Ghaeilgeoir lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht píosa talún a cheannach sa Ghaeltacht agus deontas a fháil má léiríonn sé gurb í an Ghaeilge a ghnáth-theanga teaghlaigh? </P>

      <P>Is féidir leo deontas a fháil don teach atá tógtha acu roimh theacht go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Fáiltím roimhe sin mar tá daoine ar fud na tíre atá lándáiríre i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Fáiltím freisin roimh an ardú sna deontais. An rud is tábhachtaí ná an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a húsáid a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht. An bhfuil cruthúnas ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil na scéimeanna seo ag cabhrú leis an bpríomhaidhm sin? Tá tuairim agam go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul i léig sna Gaeltachtaí agus tá sé riachtanach é sin a athrú le go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ag éirí láidir, mar gan sin, is deacair í a chur chun cinn taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Sa mhéid is go bhfuil an Bille seo ag cur eagar ar a bhfuil ann go dtí seo agus ag tabhairt rudaí nua isteach agus go mbeidh sé ar chumas an Aire as seo amach scéimeanna a fhógairt nó a athrú, is maith sin.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla bomaithe a thabhairt don Teachta Michael Kitt, má tá cead agam. Fáiltím roimh na leasuithe sa Bhille seo agus taobh amuigh de mo chomhleacaí, Pat The Cope Gallagher ní raibh Aire nó Aire Stáit againn riamh a rinne níos mó ar son na Gaeltachta ná an Teachta Ó Cuív. Ó toghadh ina Aire Stáit é, tá athrú mór tagtha ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta, i mo dháilcheantar féin, sna háiteacha beag agus mór. Tá straitéis beartaithe aige anois chun a gcuid féin a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus na galltacha araon. Failtím roimh na bóithre feabhsaithe atá curtha ar fáil aige agus roimh an straitéis aige go mbeidh bóthar maith amháin ar a laghad ag gach Gaeltacht, ar nós Cúl an Earagail agus Gleann Cholm Cille. Tugann sé aitheantas mór do na hoileáin agus ón bplean oibre atá aige is léir go mbeidh feabhsúcháin eile ag teacht.</P>
      <P>Tá rudaí praiticiúla sa Bhille seo le moladh. Acmhainn thábhachtach í an Ghaeltacht don tír uilig. Is mian soiléir é de chuid mhuintir na hÉireann go mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt go beo bríomhar agus sna glúnta atá romhainn. Le seo a chinntiú, tá orainn tacaíocht phraiticiúil mar seo a chur ar fáil do phobail agus do theaghlaigh na Gaeltachta. Díríonn na leasuithe sa Bhille seo ar na riachtanais thábhachtacha seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is fiú go mór an tacaíocht a bheas ar fáil do theaghlaigh le Gaeilge atá ag smaointiú ar filleadh abhaile go dtí na Gaeltachtaí agus na <Col N="874" /> hoileáin. Tabharfaidh an tacaíocht seo spreagadh dóibh teach nua a thógáil sa bhaile. Cé go mbeidh níos mó post ag teastáil sa Ghaeltacht do na daoine seo, tá a fhios agam go bhfuil fonn ar dhaoine filleadh abhaile ón iasacht agus is maith ann an deontas tithíochta seo.</P>
    <P>Tabharfaidh an Bille seo seans do dhaoine obair ar ardchaighdeán a dhéanamh ar a gcuid tithe. Tá an tacaíocht á cur ar fáil do fheabhsúcháin riachtanacha, obair shéarachais, seomraí folctha agus seirbhísí uisce méadaithe go mór agus cuirfear fáilte forleathan rompu sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Nuair a fheictear an t-ardú sna deontais, is léir go rachaidh an scéim chun leasa mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus an mhuintir nach bhfuil ina gcónaí ann. Tugann na méaduithe le fios do phobal na Gaeltachta go bhfuilimid i ndáiríre faoi chaomhnú na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuilimid ag cur gach deis ar fáil le cinntiú go mbeidh sé ar chumas na muintire sin gnáthriachtanais an lae inniu a bheith acu, mar is amhlaidh i ngach áit eile faoin dtír.</P>
    <P>Tá na hoileáin amach ón gcósta ina seod luachmhar agus tá orainn a chinntiú go mbeidh caighdeán sásúil maireachtála ag na daoine ar na hoileáin seo. Bíonn costais níos troime ar mhuintir na n-oileán agus is cúis áthais go n-aithníonn an tAire sin sa Bhille seo. Is maith go bhfuil na seirbhísí riachtanacha anois againn ar na hoileáin, ar Oileán Árainnmhór agus Thoraí, mar shampla, mar a bhfuil bunscoileanna agus meánscoil, agus tá sárobair déanta ag an mbord sláinte chun seirbhísí a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán. Is de bhuíochas an Aire Stáit agus an bhrú a chuir sé orthu go bhfuil na seirbhísí seo ann. Tá leictreachas ag na hoileáin bheaga agus tá mé ag súil le hathruithe móra i dTír Chonaill de dheasca an dul chun cinn seo.</P>
    <P>Tá dualgas orainn ár n-oidhreacht Gaeltachta a neartú agus a chaomhnú. Fáiltím roimh an fhoráil go dtabharfar cuidiú do úinéirí tithe ceann tuí na tithe sin a fheabhsú. Tá dúshlán mór romhainn a chinntiú go mairfidh pobail Ghaeltachta a labhrann an Ghaeilge go laethúil. Ceann de na deacrachtaí a chaithfear aghaidh a thabhairt uirthi ná nach raibh an deis ag gach duine a chuireann faoi sa Ghaeltacht an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. Ní mór go mbeadh an tacaíocht fhial a bheas ar fáil de thoradh na leasuithe seo ina bhuntáiste ag an uimhir is mó daoine is féidir. Caithfimid a chinntiú go mbeidh deiseanna foghlamtha Gaeilge ag daoine atá ag filleadh abhaile nó a thagann isteach sa Ghaeltacht chun cónaí le go mbeidh a saol fite fuaite go hiomlán le saibhreas cultúrtha na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bíonn daoine sa Ghaeltacht ag gearán nach féidir leo deontais tithíochta a fháil muna mbíonn an bheirt tuismitheoir ábalta Gaeilge a labhairt. Tá an tAire Stáit ag iarraidh orainn níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid chun í a choimeád beo sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh. Ar láimh amháin táimid ag cur brú ar dhaoine Gaeilge a labhairt agus ar an láimh eile táimid ag cur bac ar dhaoine filleadh abhaile ar an nGaeltacht. Tá sé in am dúinn tacaí<Col N="875" /> ocht a thabhairt do dhaoine chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a úsáid sa bhaile. Tá an-suim ag páistí agus ag a dtuismitheoirí sna gaelscoileanna ach ní úsaidtear an Ghaeilge nuair atá páistí ag súgradh lena chéile sa Ghaeltacht. Níl a fhios agam cad is féidir a dhéanamh faoi sin ach tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire in ann teacht ar réiteach éigin. Mar Theachta Dála do dáilcheantar ina bhfuil Gaeltacht, tá a fhios agam na fadhbanna atá acu. Táimid ag iarraidh orthu cónaí sa Ghaeltacht chun cabhair a thabhairt do na scoileanna agus ionas go mbeidh postanna agus seirbhísí ar fáil ann.</P>
    <P>Ag an am gcéanna, sílim féin go bhfuil an teanga ag sleamhnú agus nach bhfuil sé á úsáid mar ghnáth-theanga. Ba mhór an trua a bhéadh sé dá gcaillfimid ár teanga agus ár gcultúr. Tá go leor déanta ag go leor daoine sa Ghaeltacht chun chabhair a thabhairt don Ghaeilge agus don gcultúr a bheith beo. Ag an am gcéanna, sílim féin go bhfuil sé ag sleamhnú. Caithfimid dul ar ais arís agus b'fhéidir cabhair a thabhairt dóibh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim arís.</P>
    <P>Sílim féin go bhfuil an t-Aire Stáit ag tnúth ar Bille don teanga. Tá daoine ann a smaoiníonn nach bhfuil a gceartaí acu an Ghaeilge a úsáid nuair a théann siad go dtí an comhairle condae nó an Roinn nó áiteanna mar sin. B'fhéidir go gcuireann sin brú ar achan duine an Ghaeilge a úsáid níos mó, ar nós Stáit seirbhísí, Teachtaí Dála, Seanadóirí &ndash; achan duine atá ag obair ar son muintir na Gaeltachta ionas go mbeidh siad ábalta achan rud a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>É sin ráite, sílim féin go mbeidh athrú mór déanta ag an Aire Stáit ag éirí as an mBille. Sílim go bhfuil tacaíocht á thabhairt ó achan duine chun an Bille a bheith againn. Fáiltím go mórmhór an sárobair atá déanta ag an Aire Stáit ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus na n-oileán. Tá súil agam go mbeimid anseo ar feadh dhá bhlian nó níos mó b'fhéidir chun níos mó a dhéanamh ar son an Ghaeilge agus ar son muintir na Ghaeltachta agus a saol.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím an Bhille seo agus gabhaim comhghairdeachas leis an Aire, an Teachta de Valera, agus go h-áirithe leis an Aire Stáit, Éamon Ó Cuív. Mar is eol dom, cuireadh tús leis na deontasaí seo i 1926 agus bhí an dlí curtha i bhfeidhm i 1929. B'shin an chéad dlí chun deontasaí a chuir ar fáil. Sa Bhille seo, tá an t-Aire Stáit ag caint mar gheall ar an leathnú agus an leasú atá á dhéanamh aige ar Achtanna na tithe Gaeltachta. Tá a lán déanta ag an Aire Stáit, go h-áirithe don Ghaeltacht, ó thaobh tithíocht, bóithre agus scéimeanna uisce agus serbhísí.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte faoi leith roimh an bprionsabal atá aige sa Bhille chun rudaí a dhéanamh níos oiriunaí don lá atá inniu ann. Labhraíonn sé sa Bhille mar gheall ar níos mó airgead a chur ar fáil nuair atá teach á thógáil mar teach i gcomhair gnáth-chónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus is maith an rud é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> Labhair an t-Aire Stáit faoi na tithe sa Ghaeltacht. Tá daoine ina gcónaí i Mountbellew, baile in aice liom, agus deireann siad liom go bhfuil siad sa bhreac Ghaeltacht. Deireann an t-Aire Stáit nach bhfuil aon rud cosúil le breac Ghaeltacht i nGaillimh Thoir. Tá na daoine seo ag iarraidh deontas a fháil mar is í Gaeilge an gnáth-theanga sa teaghlach. B'fhéidir gurb é sin an fáth a labhraíonn an t-Aire Stáit sa Bhille mar gheall ar savings. Labhraíonn sé faoi caiteachas breise a mhoilliú de réir an riail sin. Tá sé ar intinn ag na daoine i gceist deontasaí a fháil ach, de réir an Bhille seo, ní bheidh siad in ann deontasaí mar sin a fháil.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tá a lán gaelscoileanna ann anois sna bailtí, mór agus beag. Tá suim ag cuid mhaith daoine san iarthar, i nGaillimh ach go h-áirithe, sa Ghaeilge. Cuirim fáilte roimh an deontas le h-aghaidh díon tí a dheisiú. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tá sé deacair duine a fháil chun an obair sin a dhéanamh anois in aon áit in Éirinn agus go h-áirithe ar na h-oileáin agus in áiteanna iargualta. Is dóigh liom go gcaithfimid cúrsaí a chur ar fáil chun an cheard sin a leasú agus a mhéadú.</P>
    <P>In alt 8 labhraíonn an t-Aire Stáit faoi méadú suas le 200% i leith oibreacha ar oileáin Gaeltachta agus oileáin amach ón gcósta. Is maith an rud é sin. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tá sé deacair ábhair tógála a thabhairt amach go dtí oileáin agus caithfimid níos mó deontasaí a thabhairt do áiteanna mar sin.</P>
    <P>Labhraíonn sé freisin mar gheall ar na scéimeanna nua atá á thabhairt isteach aige. Ba mhaith liom níos mó eolas a fháil fúthu mar tá sé an-tábhachtach, go h-áirithe do dhaoine aostach. Níl ach na scéimeanna atá ag an gcomhairle condae nó an bord sláinte i bhfeidhm faoi láthair chun cuidiú le daoine aosta.</P>
    <P>In alt 11, labhraíonn an t-Aire Stáit faoin Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán ag plé le aisíoc iasachtaí in áit oifigí agus oibreacha poiblí. Cuirim fáilte roimhe sin freisin. Is maith an rud é go bhfuil deireadh á chur le deontas don dara teach agus don chalet saoire. Ní cheart go raibh an scéim sin i bhfeidhm agus rudaí mar sin ag tarlú.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom na hathraithe atá déanta leis na Dáilcheantair i dtaobh na toghacháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a phlé. Sin an fáth gur luaigh mé an bhreac Ghaeltacht. Is dóigh liom nach bhfuil gach duine cinnte céard is Gaeltacht ann. Tá an t-údarás ag déanamh a dhícheall fostaíochta a fháil. B'fhéidir nach bhfuilimid go léir soiléir faoi na dáilcheantair agus teorainn na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Bhí díospóireacht againn roimh na Nollag faoi cheist na Gaeilge. Bhí mé féin ag caint faoi suirbhé i mBaile Locha Riach i gCondae na Gaillimhe. De réir an suirbhé sin, bhí an-meas ag muintir an bhaile ar an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhb eile sa Ghaeltacht agus tá sé díreach ag baint le cúrsaí tithíochta, sé sin, an fhadhb atá ag daoine cead pleanála a fháil chun teach a thógáil, go háirithe teach le haghaidh clann. Mar is <Col N="877" /> eol dúinn go léir, tá a lán árasán á thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus b'fhéidir cúpla óstán. In áiteanna sa Ghaeltacht cuirtear an-fáilte roimh na hárasáin sin mar gur féidir le turasóirí teacht isteach agus lóistín a chur ar fáil dóibh sa Ghaeltacht. Ní bhíonn na turasóirí sin ann sa gheimhreadh agus ní bhíonn éinne sna hárasáin sin. Deireann a lán daoine sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil sé féaráilte go bhfuil sé sin ann agus, ag an am gcéanna, go bhfuil sé an-deacair cead pleanála a fháil chun teach a thógáil agus go bhfuil fadhbanna acu leis an gcomhairle condae mar gheall ar sin. Ós rud é go bhfuilim ag caint faoi thurasóirí, tá ceist na mbóithre an-tábhachtach agus tá airgead á chur ar fáil ag an Aire Stáit dóibh. Níl aon dual carriageway nó mótarbhealach sa Ghaeltacht agus b'fhéidir gur maith an rud é sin. De réir tuairiscí ón gcomhairle contae i nGaillimh tá mótarbhealach le tógáil idir chathair na Gaillimh agus Béal Átha an tSlua. Déarfainn go mbeidh an Teachta Gilmore an-sásta go bhfuil an mótarbhealach sin ag teacht. Beidh sé ann i gceann cúig bliana nó mar sin.</P>
    <P>Ní mór airgead a chaitheamh ar bhóithre beaga freisin, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do na turasóirí a thagann go dtí an ceantar sin. Maidir le cúrsaí tithíochta, is scéim an-mhaith í scéim na coláiste samhraidh. Tá a lán déanta ag an Aire Stáit chun deontais a fháil do na scéimeann sin, do na mná tí ach go háirithe. Tá na mná tí le moladh as an gcúnamh a thugann siad do na scoileanna. Tá airgead ar fáil freisin chun maisiúcháin agus deisiúcháin a dhéanamh ar thithe.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo chun tithe agus deisiúcháin a chur ar fáil. Beidh airgead ag teastáil freisin chun scéimeanna séarachais a chur ar bun, mar atá á éileamh ag beagnach gach ceantar Gaeltachta. Má bhíonn na scéimeanna sin ann, beidh na tithe ann freisin. Tá ardmholadh ag dul don Aire Stáit as an mBille seo.</P>

Táthar ag cur ionamarca béime ar theorainneacha Gaeltachta. Tá níos mó daoine anois ag úsáid na Gaeilge i mo dháilcheantar féin i nDún Laoghaire i gceartlár chathair Átha Cliath ná mar atá sna Gaeltachtaí agus is mar sin a bheas an scéal amach anseo, fad is a mbeidh na Gaeltachtaí féin ag dul i léig de thoradh forbairtí áirithe atá ag idir láimhe. Caithfear imeacht chomh fada siar leis an gCeathrú Rua go dtí Cois Fharraige chun teacht ar phobal a úsáideann an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga. Tá go leor daoine ina gcónaí ansin nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge á húsáid acu agus is eol don Aire Stáit é sin. Tá na Gaeltachtaí ag dul i léig an t-am ar fad.</P>

      <P>Níl mórán Gaeilge i Knocknacarra faoi láthair cé go bhfuil sé go hoifigiúil sa Ghaeltacht. Is faoi cúrsaí tithíochta is mó a ba mhaith caint a dhéanamh anocht. Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Ó Sé agus is cúis náire don Rialtas seo gurb í seo an chéad Bhille Tithíochta a thug siad os comhair na Dála le linn a dtréimhse de cheithre bliana beagnach. Tá an crís tithíochta is measa riamh againn, tá praghas na dtithe imithe in airde, tá cíosanna imithe in airde, tá líon na ndaoine atá ar liostaí tithíochta na gcomhairlí contae imithe i méid. Go hoifigiúil, tá 45,000 ar liostaí tithíochtaí ar fud na tíre. Má chuirtear san áireamh na daoine atá ar liostaí do thithíocht shóisialta, tá timpeall 60,000 clann ar liostaí comhairle contae ar fud na tíre.</P>
      <P>Tá líon na ndaoine gan dídean dulta in airde freisin. Tá breis is míle páistí gan dídean thart ar chathair Átha Cliath agus is í seo an chéad Bhille Tithíochta d'aon saghas atá tugtha isteach. Molaim an tAire Stáit as a bhfuil á dhéanamh aige ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach tá sé scanallach nach bhfuil faic eile déanta ag an Rialtas seo i dtaobh an chrís tithíochta atá againn anois.</P>
      <P>The housing crisis is a shame on the Government. Young families are simply being priced out of the housing market. According to the surveys undertaken by the auctioneering firms, the rate of increase in house prices is £20,000 per year. The average price of a second-hand house in Dublin is now over £200,000. The cheapest house available on the market in my own area is now about £160,000 for a former council house. Families on moderate incomes simply cannot afford those house prices and are increasingly being forced into an overcrowded and overpriced private rented housing market which is under-regulated by the Government.</P>
      <P>Even when private rented accommodation can be accessed &ndash; the position is particularly difficult for families with children and doubly difficult for families dependent on health board rent allowances &ndash; the rents payable are extremely high. The survey findings published by Gunne auctioneers in the course of the past week showed that rents in the private rented sector had increased in the past three years alone by between by 53% and 68%. This is an underestimate. If one looks at the report of the commission on the private rented sector, one will find that rents for those in receipt of rent allowance have increased by about 76%. Huge chunks of people, therefore, are being priced out of the housing market. There is a total of about 60,000 families on local authority lists of one kind or another waiting for housing, while the number of homeless people has doubled in the lifetime of the Government.</P>

      <P>The failure of the Government to deal with the housing crisis is a scandal. I appreciate that I might be testing the boundaries of the Leas-Cheann Chomhairle's patience on this matter but I must take advantage of this opportunity to make my point.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me tell the Minister of State about the Finance Bills. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, announced last July when he published the report of the commission on the private rented sector that the commission's recommendations would be examined by the Government as a package. Just after Christmas he announced that the landlords would get their benefits and tax concessions in the Finance Bill to be published in a couple of weeks but that the unfortunate tenants who are living in the same accommodation will have to wait another two years before they will get the rights that were recommended by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to communicate to his colleagues in Government, who have wider responsibility for housing than the limited responsibility the Minister of State enjoys in respect of the Gaeltacht, that they need to bring before the House measures to tackle the appalling housing circumstances facing families throughout the country. I take the opportunity to say that now just as I have taken the opportunity to say it in the course of other debates on other issues in this House. The Government's failure to deal effectively with the housing crisis is a scandal that will haunt it all the way to the ballot box whenever <Col N="880" /> it decides to come out of the bunker and face the people.</P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> De réir an cáipéise míniúcháin, is é an cuspóir atá leis an mBille seo ná leasú agus leathnú a dhéanamh ar Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltachta) chun iad a dhéanamh níos oiriúnaí don lá inniu. Measaim go n-aontóidh gach duine le sin. Méadaítear na deontais atá ar fáil do dhaoine ata ag lorg tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus leagtar béim fé leith ar Alt 4 a deir gur féidir le daoine atá ag maireachtaint taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht gur de bhunadh na Gaeltachta iad, nó Gaeilgeoirí ar a laghad, is dócha, agus atá chun cur futhu sa Ghaeltacht cur isteach ar dheontais do thithe a thógtar sa Ghaeltacht fad atá siad ag maireachtaint taobh amuigh de. Tá sé sin ciallmhar.</P>
      <P>Maidir le cúrsaí tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht, tá na deacrachtaí céanna ag daoine sa Ghaeltacht, agus daoine óga go mór mór, is atá ag a gcomhleacuithe taobh amuigh. Tá praghas uafásach le díol ar shuíomh tí sa Ghaeltacht anois. Tá daoine óga ag fulaingt freisin de bharr an ráta boilscithe i gcostais thógála. Tá an géarchéim tithíochta ar fud na tíre ag cur isteach ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta freisin. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil na praghsanna chomh hard leis na cathracha agus tá siad ag dul i méid i gcónaí agus is féidir go dtiomáinfidh siad daoine óga as an nGaeltacht. Níl tithe nó árasáin ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí agus bíonn orthu imeacht taobh amuigh de chun tithíocht a fháil.</P>
      <P>Ba chóir go mbeadh dóthain soláthar tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht le nach gcuirfí bac ar dhaoine óga ar mhaith leo cur futhu ann. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an tAire Stáit ar ais le réiteach ar an gceist seo mar is ceist leathan í nach leigheasfar le deontais amháin nó leis na hathruithe sa Bhille seo, cé go n-aontaím lena bhformhór nó leo go léir, b'fhéidir. Caithfear níos mó samhlaíochta a úsáid chun réiteach a fháil ar na fadhbanna móra praghais atá againn le trí nó ceithre bliana anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an tAire Stáit á rá go mbeidh méadú ar na deontais chun tithe a thógáil agus a dheisiú agus is maith sin. Ach an bhfuil aon srian á chur ar lucht tógála maidir leis an bpraghas chun teach a thógáil? Tharla sé seo sa tír seo cheana nuair a tugadh deontas £3,000 sna hochtóidí do dhaoine a bhí ag ceannach tithe nua don chéad uair gur chuir lucht tógála na dtithe praghas na dtithe in airde de £3,000. Shúigh siad isteach an £3,000 de dheontas do ghnáthdhaoine. Is oth liom a rá gurb é sin an saghas dream tógála atá againn sa tír seo. Cinnte, tá daoine beaga sa Ghaeltacht ag tógáil tithe nach bithiúnaigh iad, ach leis an méid atá feicthe againn i gcathracha na tíre seo, is bithiúnaigh iad na daoine atá i bhfeighil na n-eastát móra tithíochta atá á dtógáil i láthair na huaire, ó thaobh praghais de. Cloisimid go léir na scéalta uafáis atá ag teacht amach as an margadh tithíochta faoi láthair. Tá praghsanna ag méadú de chúig mhíle nó de dheich míle punt thar oíche. Is breá an rud é na deontais a mhéadú, ach má ardaíonn lucht tógála na praghsanna den méid <Col N="881" /> céanna, ní rachaidh sé sin chun leas na ndaoine atá i gceist sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh bunadh na Gaeltachta in ann cur futhu sa Ghaeltachta dá mba mhian leo é. Caithfear brú i bhfad níos mó a chur ar na comhairlí contae maidir le cuid de na beartais atá acu ó thaobh tithíocht a sholáthar dóibhsiúd atá ar liostaí na gcomhairlí contae. Na comhairlí contae sin a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta faoina gcúram atá i gceist agam anseo. Bhuail mé le fear um Nollaig arb as ceartlár Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne dó. Tá sé ar an liosta comhairle contae agus bhíothas ag iarraidh é a chur isteach sa Daingean cé gur mian leis fanacht sa Ghaeltacht agus clann a thógáil ann. Níl sé seo ceart agus dá ndéanfaí go ginearálta chuirfeadh sé dlús le meath na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí faoi bhrú millteanach maidir leis an dteanga agus an chultúr agus ba cheart go mbeadh beartas i bhfeidhm le cuidiú ó Roinn an Aire Stáit go mbeadh bancanna beaga talún ag gach comhairle contae sna Gaeltachtaí, go mór mór timpeall ar na sráidbhailte i dtreo is go bhféadfaí tithe a chur ar fáil dóibhsiúd ar mian leo fanacht ann.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go gcuirfí in aghaidh go tréan aon bhrú a chuirtear ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta bogadh amach as chun teach a fháil. Tá sé de fhreagracht ar an gcomhairle contae gan cur leis an mbrú seo ar an nGaeltacht ach a mhalairt.</P>
    <P>Is eol dúinn go léir gurb áiteanna áille iad Gaeltachtaí na tíre agus tá fonn orainn go léir go gcaomhnófar an áilleacht seo agus gan tithe a thógáil gan meas ar an dtimpeallacht. Ní ceart go dtógfaí tithe aon áit a cheillfí an áilleacht seo ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta nó ar chuairteoirí go dtí an Ghaeltacht. An tslí is fearr chun forbairt chuí a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht agus dóthain tithe a chur ar fáil nó forbairt theoranta a cheadú timpeall ar an sráidbhailte atá ann. Ba chóir go mbeadh beartas chuige seo ag na comhairlí contae uilig. Chiallódh sé sin go mbeadh suíomhanna le fáil ar phraghas réasúnta agus go mbeadh tithe á dtógáil ag an gcomhairle contae féin ar phraghas réasúnta.</P>
    <P>Dá mbeadh suíomhanna á ndíol le daoine óga, chaithfí a bheith cinnte nach mbeadh aon speiciléireacht i gceist agus rialacha a leagadh síos chuige sin fé mar atá ag tarlú i mBaile Átha Cliath fé láthair fén gcóras leath is leath. Faoin gcóras sin díolann an chomhairle contae as leath an tí, agus an t-áitreabhach as an leath eile agus tá rialacha diana ann fé dhíol na dtithe seo ina dhiaidh, chun speiciléireacht a sheachaint.</P>
    <P>Le beartas den tsaghas seo d'fhéadfaí fuinneamh agus sprid nua a chruthú sna sráidbhailte beaga mórthimpeall na Gaeltachta go háirithe in áiteanna mar a bhfuil an daonra ag dul in aois. Dhéanfaí glúin nua a chothú san áit ach teaghlaigh óga a thabhairt chun cónaí ann a bheadh ag labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ní theastaíonn ó éinne go gcaillfí an Ghaeilge ach tá dainséar ann leis an mbrú mór seo. Ní náisiúntóirí sinn sa Pháirtí Sóisialach &ndash; táimid oscailte do gach cultúr ar domhan  &ndash; ach ní mór <Col N="882" /> dúinn cultúir na tíre seo a chaomhnú trí mheas a chothú ar an nGaeilge. Uaidh seo, cothófar meas ar chultúir eile, go háirithe iad siúd atá ag teacht isteach sa tír faoi láthair leis na himircigh.</P>
    <P>Is faoin Aire Stáit atá sé níos mó smaoinimh a dhéanamh ar an gceist seo agus beartais níos samhlaíocha a thabhairt ar aghaidh. Ós muid ag caint ar chúrsaí tithíochta, goilleann sé orm nuair a chím iarratais á gcur isteach do scéimeanna móra tithíochta samhraidh, mar shampla, i gCeann Trá agus gur tugadh cead dóibh ag an gcomhairle contae. Ní hé seo an tslí ar aghaidh; milleann na scéimeanna móra an timpeallacht sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh de. Déanann siad truailliú agus cé go gcaithfear dídean a chur ar fáil do chuairteoirí chun na Gaeltachta, ní hé seo an bealach le dul.</P>
    <P>Caithfear níos mó tacaíochta a chur ar fáil do scéimeanna séarachais agus uisce sna sráidbhailte i dtreo is go mbeidh fíoruisce ag gach duine go flúirseach. Tá imní orm faoin gcóras séarachais atá againn faoi láthair agus tá contúirt ann go ndéanfar truailliú ar an dtábla uisce dá bharr.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thagann an tAire Stáit ar ais, ba mhaith liom míniú a fháil ar Alt 9 sa Bhille. Cad a chiallaíonn &ldquo;d'ainneoin aon ní in Acht na dTithe Gaeltachta (Leasú) 2000, féadfaidh an tAire le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais agus de réir aon rialacháin faoin alt seo, scéimeanna a dhéanamh chun deontais nó cúnamh airgeadais eile a sholáthar do dhuine faoi chóir an chostas a ghabhann le teach cónaithe sa Ghaeltacht a thógáil nó a fheabhsú i gcás gur deimhin leis an Aire nach rachaidh áitiú an tí chónaithe sin chun aimhleas úsáid na Gaeilge sa limistéar Gaeltachta sin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Caithfear é sin a mhíniú mar de réir mar a thuigimse an chabhair airgeadais agus mar sin de atá á tabhairt, tugtar ar choinníoll go mbeidh caighdeán áirithe ann.</P>
    <P>Beidh mé ag fanacht le freagra an Rialtais ag deireadh na díospóireachta seo agus tá súil agam go nglacfaidh siad le cuid de na pointí a rinneadh agus go dtiocfaidh siad ar ais le Bille níos leithne a fhreastalaíonn níos fearr ar na fadhbanna atáimid ag iarraidh a shárú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille gearr seo. Tá tábhacht ag baint leis ó thaobh na dlí de  &ndash; bhí sé ag teastáil toisc gur éirigh le cás a tugadh os comhair cúirte cúpla bliain ó shin. É sin ráite, má chabhraíonn sé le cúrsaí tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht ba chóir dúinn uilig fáiltiú roimhe.</P>
      <P>Bhí suim agam in abairt amháin a fheictear i gcúpla áit, sé sin, le toil an Roinn Airgeadais. Is cuimhin liom an abairt sin mar bhí meon áirithe ag an Roinn Airgeadais i gcónaí i leith na Gaeltacha. Nuair a bhí mé féin mar Aire Gaeltachta bhí daoine sa Roinn sin a cheap go mba chóir dom féin íoc as an méid a caitheadh ar bhunú Theilifís na Gaeilge agus mar sin de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú ar chúpla ní sa Bhille seo a fháil ón Aire Stáit. Le bheith ionraic, tuigim go bhfuil suim as an ngnáthach ag an Aire Stáit i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta agus fáiltím roimhe sin. Tá práinn ag baint le cúrsaí tithíochta faoi láthair <Col N="883" /> mar tá an-chuid daoine tar éis teacht ar ais ón iasacht. Sa bhliain 1955, d'imigh 55,000 duine as an tír seo agus an chuid is mó acu ón iarthar agus ó na Gaeltachtaí. Ba mhaith le an-chuid daoine atá i Sasana faoi láthair teacht ar ais ach níl an seans acu toisc nach bhfuil siad in ann teach a thógáil.</P>
    <P>Deacracht atá agam leis an mBille ná nach bhfuil go leor tithíocht phoiblí á cur ar fáil. Nuair a smaoiním siar ar nuair a thosaigh mé féin sa pholaitíocht i gcathair na Gaillimhe agus i nGaillimh Thiar, chuir sé ionadh orm i gcónaí a laghad tithe a chuir an chomhairle contae ar fáil sa limistéar Gaeltachta. Bhí an deacracht chéanna acu i gContae Dhún na nGall agus i gCiarraí.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na deacrachtaí a bhain leis sin ná go raibh ar an duine féin an suíomh a chur ar fáil. Tá a lán daoine ann nach féidir leo suíomh a cheannach agus tá brú uafásach ó chathair na Gaillimhe amach go dtí an Ghaeltacht, agus tá praghas na suíomhanna imithe suas dá réir. Cúpla lá ó shin nuair a bhí príomhoifigeach Údarás na Gaeltachta ag tabhairt tuarascáil bhliantúil uaidh, luaigh sé a dheacra is atá sé daoine a mhealladh chun dul ag obair sa Ghaeltacht. Tá sé deacair tithe a fháil ar cíos, fiú, agus is fadhb phráinneach í.</P>
    <P>D'éist mé leis an méid a dúirt an cainteoir a chuaigh romham faoina dhearcadh féin, go mba chóir leas a bhaint as an mbunstruchtúr atá ann cheana féin sna sráidbhailte chun tithe agus seirbhísí a chur iontu agus go gcuirfeadh sé le saol sóisialta na mbailte leis. Tá deacracht agam maidir leis an rud go léir a bhunú ar shuíomh príomháideach.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom an solúbthacht a fheicim sa Bhille. Le déanaí bhí mé ag plé le cás i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe &ndash; bean a bhfuair a fear céile bás agus gan é ach dhá scór. Bhí sise ag tabhairt aire do mháthair a céile agus bhí ceathrar clainne uirthi agus ní féidir lei aon airgead a fháil chun an teach a fheabhsú toisc go mbaineann an teach le máthair a céile. Agus toisc nach bhfuil an mháthair sin ina cónaí lei féin ní féidir lei cabhair a fháil ó Bhord Sláinte an Iarthair. Dá gcuirfeadh an seanbhean an clann amach ar an mbóthar bheadh cead aici cabhair a lorg ón mbord sláinte. Ach mar atá rudaí níl aon chabhair dóibh.</P>

    <P>An fáth a luaigh mé sin, ní chun mileán a chur <Col N="884" /> ar an Aire Stáit ach le taispeáint cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé a bheith solúbtha i leith na scéimeanna éagsúla. Baineann an tAcht seo leis na scéimeanna a tháinig ar an saol ó na fichidí go dtí inniu agus bhí cúis dlithiúil leis na leasuithe seo.</P>
    <P>Aon duine atá ag iarraidh rud ar bith a dhéanamh maidir le cúrsaí tithíochta nó sláinte i nGaillimh caithfidh siad déileáil le heagrais Stáit agus fo-eagrais Stáit i gcathair na Gaillimhe agus is minic nach mbíonn Gaeilge ag oifigigh na n-eagras áirithe sin. Beidh fáilte roimh Bhille na Gaeilge nuair a thiocfaidh sé ar an saol.</P>
    <P>Tá ar a laghad trí chás ar eolas agam faoi lanúin a raibh Gaeilge ag duine amháin acu agus go bhfuair duine amháin bás agus gur fágadh an duine a bhí gan Gaeilge sa teach, b'fhéidir teach le ceann tuí. An mbeadh duine i gcás mar sin i dteideal deontas feabhsúcháin don teach sin? Nó an gcuirfear ceist orthu maidir lena gcumas Gaeilge? Tá daoine i gcásanna mar sin atá ina gcónaí sa teach céanna le fada agus de bharr an damáiste a dhéanann stoirmeacha ba chóir go mbeadh an scéim solúbtha chuige seo ionas gur féidir teacht i gcabhair ar dhaoine mar iad.</P>
    <P>Tá dearcadh constaiciúil ag an Roinn Airgeadais maidir le hairgead a chaitheamh ar na hoileáin agus ar an nGaeltacht. Bhí an deacracht sin agam leo. Failtím roimh na forálacha speisialta do mhuintir na n-oileán mar is léir go bhfuil costais bhreise ar mhuintir na n-oileán i ndáil le hiompar agus tógáil. Ní bheadh aon deacracht agam féin le haon chabhair speisialta a thabharfaí do mhuintir na n-oileán.</P>
    <P>Tá mé den tuairim le fada gurbh fhearr cúram thithíocht na Gaeltachta a chur faoin údarás agus go ndéanfaí údarás réigiúnach de agus go n-aistreofaí cuid de chúraimí na comhairle contae chuige. Tá deacracht ann sa mhéid is go bhfuil sé de nós ag bainisteoirí contae gach cumhacht agus cúram atá acu a chosaint agus a choinneáil dóibh féin. Bheadh córas réigiúnach i bhfad níos fearr ionas go mbeadh an dualgas tithíochta ar an ndream céanna ar a bhfuil dualgas maidir le fostaíocht a chruthú. B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos éasca déileáil leis an bhfadhb seo ó thaobh na Gaeilge de dá mbeadh an t-athrú sin i gcríoch.</P>
    <P>An riail sin a chosc ar dhaoine cur isteach ar dheontas tithíochta muna raibh siad ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht fad a bhí an teach á thógáil, ní raibh aon chiall ag baint leis sin. Tá an t-athrú níos fearr.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfaí an chabhair seo a dhíriú ar na riachtanais is mó. Nuair a bhí mé féin ag plé le deontas na bhfuinneoga, dúradh nár ghá gach fuinneog a tógadh amach a thógáil amach agus b'fhéidir go raibh cuid den seanábhar a bhí iontu níos fearr ná an t-ábhar a bhí sna cinn nua. Ach tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint le teach maith. Sa teach inar tógadh mé, bhí deacrachtaí leis an díon agus is cuimhin liom na deacrachtaí breise a chruthaigh sé seo don chlann. Níl sé ceart faoin reachtaíocht seo an fhadhb ghinearálta a phlé ach caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh. Seo é an chéad uair a dúirt Bardas na Gaillimhe, ó tháinig mé féin go Gaillimh i 1960, nach féidir leo aon tairis<Col N="885" /> cint tí a dhéanamh go dtí go mbíonn an duine cúig bliana ar an liosta. Tá riachtanais tithíochta ag dul i méid agus tá an t-éileamh ar thithe príomháideacha imithe ó smacht chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn an fhadhb seo nach bhfuil méadú mór tagtha ar chostais thógála nó ar phá agus is é costas an tsuímh atá imithe ó smacht. Sin an fáth go bhfui gá le bancanna talún ag údaráis áitiúla agus bheadh sé níos fearr ó thaobh pleanála de an bunstruchtúr a neartú sna sráidbhailte. Is dóigh liom go mbeadh an tAire Stáit sásta glacadh leis an gcóras seo, níos fearr ná mórán daoine eile.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí ag seandaoine na Gaeltachta leis an maorlathas a bhíonn i gceist le hiarratais chuig an comhairle contae, an bord sláinte agus an Roinn agus is minic a bhíonn seandaoine ag plé leo seo uilig. Tá a lán páipéirí i gceist ansin. Más féidir é sin a ghearradh beidh fáilte agam roimhe sin. Ó thaobh an 14 rannóg atá sa reachtaíocht féin, tá an tAire Stáit ag glacadh cumhachtaí nach raibh ar fáil sa bhun reachtaíocht. Tá gá leis sin agus ó thaobh na reachtaíochta a bhí ann roimh 1956 agus chun é a chur i gcomhréir leis an reachtaíocht a tháinig faoi Acht 1956 bhí sé ag teastáil go mbeadh an reachtaíocht seo ann agus is maith an rud é sin. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé ag éalú ó dheachrachtaí sa pháirtí tríd an solúbthacht a úsáideann an reachtaíocht i dtéarmaí sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Tá sé contúirteach an líne sin &ldquo;le toil an Roinn Airgeadais&rdquo; a úsáid. Má tá an t-airgead ann, agus a lán de mar atá faoi láthair, b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé níos éasca. Is íontach mar a chúilíonn an Roinn Airgeadais ó aon dualgas atá orthu i leith na Gaeilge agus ó thaobh an chultúir Gaeltachta de. Caithfidh tú a choimead i gcuimhne i gcónaí go raibh an Roinn Airgeadais, nuair a bunaíodh an Stát seo, i gcoinne aibhléise. Cheap siad nach n-oibreodh sé amach. Bhí siad i gcoinne beagnach gach cinneadh éabhlóideach, go háirithe i gcás an chultúir de, a thabharfadh muintir na tíre seo isteach sa nua aois. Guím rath ar an Aire má tá sé sásta plé leo.</P>
    <P>An rud atá tábhachtach i ndeireadh na dála ná go mbeadh comhluadar ceart sna Gaeltachtaí in a mbeadh daoine aosta is daoine óga is daoine meánaoise measctha le chéile agus go mbeadh sé nádúrtha. Tá contúirt an-mhór má tá tú ag braith go hiomlán ar an teach príobháideach. Níl na suíomhanna ann; tá siad an-chostasach agus tá deacrachtaí ann ó thaobh cúrsaí pleanála de. Más féidir scéimeanna a chur le chéile a chuirfeadh leis an mbunstruchtúr ó thaobh sráidbhailte a bheith ann bheadh sé go mór chun tairbhe na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom daoine ag cur ceisteanna faoi chén fáth go mbeadh Aire na Gaeltachta ag plé le cúrsaí tithíochta agus ag rá gur chóir go mbainfeadh sin leis an Roinn Comhshaoil. An freagra ar sin ná nuair a bhain sé leis an Roinn Comhshaoil agus mura bhain sé leis na comhairlí chontae cén sampla a bhí ann go raibh siad i ndáiríre maidir le haon rud fiúntach a dhéanamh i leith cúrsaí tithíochta? Níl na scéimeanna poiblí sa Ghaeltacht ach bhí sé éasca dóibh toisc go raibh <Col N="886" /> an méid sin daoine imithe as na sráidbhailte ar fud na nGaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Dá bharr sin go ginearálta fáiltím roimh an reachtaíocht seo. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire Stáit in ann é a leathnú amach agus nuair a bheidh sé curtha i gcríoch go mbeidh muintir na Gaeltachta níos fearr as. Ní bheidh aon deacracht acu leis an Roinn féin ach leis na húdaráis eile Stáit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an mBille seo agus an deis seo a ghlacadh mo thuairimí féin a chur in iúl don Aire Stáit.</P>
      <P>The old legislation had a two-fold purpose, first, to establish better quality housing in Gaeltacht areas and, second, chun an teanga a cur chun cinn so that Irish is not lost in Gaeltacht areas. It was successful to a degree but it did not succeed to a large extent. It is significant that, as in so many other cases, western areas do not do as well as other areas in terms of housing and investment. One has only to look at the list of sub-standard schools to see how many of them are in western and Gaeltacht areas. Attention must be paid to this issue.</P>
      <P>In the past because my constituency of Clare was covered under the old Gaeltacht legislation people in certain areas were entitled to claim grants. However, this was not widely known and the restrictions were so tight that it was tantamount to a refusal to give a grant. Many of those who went to the bother of making an application under the Gaeltacht grants for housing found that it was almost impossible to qualify because the requirements were so stringent. For example, one had to be replacing sub-standard housing and Irish had to spoken by everyone in the household. The legislation was so restrictive that very few people, if any, qualified. I spoke with the Aire Stáit when this legislation was introduced as I believed it contained provisions to take away some of the entitlements for my constituency. If there had been greater awareness that funding was available under the Gaeltacht grants for housing more people would have availed of the scheme.</P>
      <P>This would also have played a part in the preservation of Irish in west Clare. The use of the language has declined substantially in areas such as Kilbaha which was a well established native Irish speaking area. The last native Irish speakers in Ballyvaughan and Kilbaha only died in the past few years. In one of the most remote areas where Irish was spoken there was little prospect of improving the standard of housing or maintaining Irish because of a lack of the necessary incentives. Instead of excluding areas where Irish is still spoken but not to the level it was 30 or 40 years ago it could have been possible to adjust the scheme so that people in these areas could qualify for a Gaeltacht grant to improve existing houses or build new ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A greater number of young people now speak Irish. I am not sure if the Gaeltacht grant scheme was intended to promote the language; I think it <Col N="887" /> was intended to promote better housing in Gaeltacht areas. I ask the Minister to consider reintroducing the old incentive and to make it easier for people to qualify for grants for new housing or to improve old housing. There is a sizeable number of inferior quality houses in western areas. In my constituency, particularly along the western seaboard, there are still a number of poor quality houses where elderly people live alone. The provision of grant-aid for people who speak Irish would be beneficial from the point of view of developing the language and improving the quality of housing. If it is proposed to exclude those areas which qualified for a grant but did not benefit from it then it would be useful to look at the introduction of an alternative scheme to encourage the use of Irish and improve housing, particularly along the western seaboard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bille seo.</P>
      <P>I represent the Kerry Gaeltacht, one of the most beautiful areas in Ireland, and I am acutely aware of the difficulties that people living there face with regard to the provision of housing. Housing in the Dingle peninsula, in particular, has become so expensive that it is beyond the reach of most young people.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister has not provided a major financial incentive to attract more young people to Gaeltacht areas. Many young people move away from the Gaeltacht because they cannot afford a house as a result of the financial burden that would be placed on them if they built there. I welcome the proposal in the Bill whereby applicants for new house grants do not need to live in the Gaeltacht while their house is being constructed. That proved difficult in the past, especially for those who were building in an area where rented accommodation was not readily available and when it was, for example, in Dingle, it was expensive. Hopefully, that provision will help many young people who are trying to build their homes in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State proposes a 200% increase in the grant payable for once-off works on offshore islands in section 8. A large proportion of the population in the Gaeltacht I represent is dependent on the fishing industry to support their livelihoods and the industry is very dependent and reliant on the weather. Last year, for example, fishermen with small operations did not go to sea very often. The number of days they fished last year was small. The 200% increase in grant-aid should also be applied to them because they are finding it very difficult to eke out a living. The Minister of State is smiling but the land is mountainous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem <Col N="888" /> with that but the same criteria should be applied to fishermen because they are trying to survive and there is a large number of them. When one visits Dingle one gets the impression that everything is wonderful but when one travels further into the peninsula one meets people who are living on the breadline and are unable to build on their land because of planning regulations and coastal protection regulations. The Minister of State should examine this issue and apply the same criteria to small farmers and fishermen.</P>

      <P>The fishing industry is dying and sheep farming, which is labour intensive, is the main form of farming in the area. Young people will not stay in the industries unless they have some incentive.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about section 11 which relates to loans. I have been dealing with a number of people who have such loans in my own Gaeltacht area. Many of them have the loans for many years and owe more today than when they took them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State address that in the Bill? Some people had been dealt with by the Department over the past number of years and they were able to repay their loans. What interest rates are being charged on the loans? How many people have taken out loans under the scheme? How many are having difficulty repaying their loans, particularly in Kerry? What is the average term of the loans?</P>
      <P>People are having difficulties because of the interest they are being charged on the loans and they might be better off shopping around for cheaper loans. This issue was dealt with by my local authority. Kerry County Council provided loans to some people probably because other institutions would not deal with them. It is not in their interest to continue these loans and perhaps the Minister of State will comment on that when he replies. A number of constituents have discussed the issue with me and if there is a provision to address it in the Bill I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposals in the legislation, particularly the seven year rule in section 9. It will enable the elderly to provide heating for themselves and will benefit those who provide accommodation for summer students. Any extra funding for the people to whom I referred earlier is very welcome. The difficulty with any Gaeltacht community in rural Ireland is that they are beautiful and there is a great deal of pressure on local authorities because of the number of planning applications. Kerry County Council is finding it very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to deal with people from the Gaeltacht and they should be given every incentive to live there as should people who have an <Col N="889" /> interest in the Irish language and who wish to live there. They would make an excellent contribution to fostering the language. It is wonderful to see young people visiting Dingle every year in their hundreds to learn Irish and it is a popular activity. However, visitors are only one thing as people must live in the area. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom an-bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na Teachtaí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht, agus i gcás phríomhPháirtí an Fhreasúra b'fhéidir nach é seo an lá is éasca dóibh a bheith sa Dáil. Ach ba é a n chéad Teachta a labhair ná an Teachta Mac Fhionnlaoich, fear a bhfuil an-tuiscint aige ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Comhartha é an Bille seo go bhfuil i gceist ag an Rialtas seo leanacht leis na scéimeanna speisialta Gaeltachta a bhí ann le fada agus a raibh contúirt ann le blianta go gcuirfí deireadh leo. Níorbh fhiú reachtaíocht a thabhairt isteach muna raibh i gceist ach rudaí a choimeád gan iad a threisiú. Ní drochrud é a chur ar thaifead na Dála na rudaí éagsúla atá déanta maidir le tithíocht ghaeltachta ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht. Méadaíodh an deontas do thithe nua ar an hoileáin ó £5,000 go £12,000 ón mbliain 1998. Tugadh an deontas ceann tuí isteach i 1990 ach bhí amhras ann an raibh sé clúdaithe go hiomlán ó thaobh reachtaíochta de. Socraíodh é a chur sa reachtaíocht seo agus i mí na Bealtaine 1999 méadaíodh an deontas do cheann tuí ó £2,700 go £5,500. Cuireadh an cheist an raibh sé seo níos mó ná an deontas taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá agus níl aon idirdhealú ann; tá sé le fáil ag chuile dhuine. Ní mórán tithe ceann tuí atá ann. Níl costas mór ag baint leis an scéim sin ach is scéim fíorthábhachtach í mar go gcaithfear na tithe ceann tuí atá ann a chaomhnú.</P>
      <P>Maidir le feabhsúcháin riachtanacha, is maith an rud don tír é stoc maith tithe a bheith ann agus go gcoimeádfaí tithe i ndea-chaoi. Tá go leor daoine ina gcónaí i dtithe sa Ghaeltacht atá ar ioncam beag nach mbionn in acmhainn gan cúnamh dea-chaoi a choinneáil ar thithe. Lobhann na fuinneoga, bíonn fadhbanna ann leis an díon agus bíonn go leor rudaí le déanamh. Sin an fáth gur mhéadaigh mé na deontais go £4,000 ó £2,300 agus iad ceangailte ar aon leibhéal leis an deontas do theach nua. Ar na hoileáin ciallóidh sé sin gur féidir deontas a fháil le caoi a chur ar theach suas le £12,000. Tiocfaidh mé ar ais ar ball go dtí an cheist a d'ardaigh an Teachta Moynihan-Cronin maidir leis an bhfáth leis an ndeontas breise agus an fáth nach bhfuil sé ar fáil do dhaoine ar ioncam íseal ar an mórthír.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le soláthar uisce, tá sé méadaithe ón 24 Deireadh Fómhair 2000 go £1,900 do chóras uisce i dteach nach bhfuil ceangailte le scéim uisce. Maidir le cúrsaí séarachais agus uisce atá ceangailte, méadaíodh an deontas i gcás séarachais ó £500 go £800 agus i gcás uisce agus séarachais maidir le saoráidí sláintíochta, méadaíodh é ó £170 go £500. Tá méadú ann do sheomra folctha <Col N="890" /> ó £800 go £1,200 ó Dheireadh Fómhair na bliana seo caite.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú ann do chuairteoirí, rud atá tábhachtach do na coláistí Gaeilge, maidir le seomraí breise a thógáil i dteach. Bhí £270 in aghaidh an tseomra i gceist ach anois tá £1,000 ann in aghaidh an tseomra. Déarfaidh daoine liom, cad is fiú £3,000 má tá tú ag cur trí sheomra ar theach agus i gcásanna mar sin is minic a gcuireann daoine caoi ar an dteach freisin nuair a bhíonn seomraí á dtógáil agus tá siad i dteideal deontas do fheabhsúcháin riachtanacha a fháil. Chiallódh sé sin go bhféadfaí deontas de suas le £7,000 a fháil chun caoi a chur ar theach agus seomraí a chur leis ag an am gcéanna.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na rudaí is mó a bhfuil éileamh air sa Roinn agus a bhfuil tacaíocht ann dó ón bpobal ná an cinneadh a rinneadh a cuireadh i bhfeidhm ar an 7 Iúil 2000 go n-áireofaí cur isteach teas lárnach nó feachsúcháin ar choras teas lárnaigh mar fheabhsú riachtanach. Roimhe sin, is minic gurb é an rud is mór a thabharfaí deara ag tabhairt cuairte ar thithe sheandaoine ná an fhuacht, an tais agus an t-easpa teasa. Go leor acu, ní raibh siad in ann níos mó a bheith ag plé le cúrsaí móna agus ní raibh siad in ann teas lárnach a fháil trí dheontas ón mbord sláinte. Is léir ó na figiúirí atá againn gurb in an réimse is mó méadú iarratas ó tháinig an riail sin isteach. Tá an teas á chur isteach ar chostas an-bheag. Níl rud níos measa ná go mbeadh fuacht ar dhuine a bhí sa teach b'fhéidir an lá uilig agus iad amach go maith sna blianta.</P>
    <P>Bhí fadhb ann go raibh cuid de na daoine seo tar éis deontas beag a fháil a chuirfeadh as go ceann seacht mbliana iad ach athraíodh an riail sin anuraidh agus uaidh sin amach má fuair tú deontas ar fhuinneoga d'fhéadfá fuílleach an deontais a fháil leis an teas lárnach a chur isteach.</P>
    <P>D'athraíomar i 1999 an riail maidir le slándáil tine. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh daoine agus tithe sábháilte. Ní bhaineann riail na seacht mbliana le slándáil tine ó 1999.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé i gcónaí idir dhá chomhairle faoin bpolasaí seo ag an Roinn. Bhí go leor contúirt tine ann fadó le tithe ceann tuí agus an riail a bhí ann ná dá bhfaighfeá teach nua go gcaithfí an seanteach a leagan. Ar bhealach is é an trua é. Bhíodh faitíos ar na húdaráis nach dtiocfadh daoine isteach sa teach nua agus go bhfanfadh siad sa seanteach nach raibh sábháilte agus go m'fhéidir go ligfidís an teach nua ar cíos. Ag an am céanna, tithe áille ab ea cuid de na seantithe seo agus ba mhór an áis iad. Ar an ábhar sin rinneadh maolú ar an riail sin anuraidh. Teach ar bith a daoradh roimh 1980 agus nár leagadh ó shin is féidir an deontas a fháil anois le caoi a chur air, fiú má tá teach ag an duine. Tá súil agam go mbeidh go leor daoine sa Ghaeltacht ag cur isteach ar an deontas seo agus go gcuirfear caoi ar na tithe seo, bíodh siad in úsáid ag duine den chlann le maireachtáil ann nó le ligean le cúpla punt a shaothrú ó thurasóirí.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta M. Higgins ag caint faoi na scéimeanna móra do thithe saoire. Cé nach tag<Col N="891" /> aim go hiomlán leis an Teachta is trua gur mar sin atá rudaí ag dul. B'fhearr i bhfad dá mbeadh teach anseo agus ansiúd á ligean le turasóirí agus iad in úinéireacht mhuintir na háite agus ioncam breise á fháil uatha le cur leis an bhfeirmeoireacht nó an iascaireacht a raibh an Teachta Moynihan-Cronin ag caint air. Go sóisialta tá sé sin i bhfad níos inghlactha agus athraíodh an riail i ngeall ar sin.</P>
    <P>D'iarr an Teachta McGinley cén fáth nár ardaíodh an deontas do theach nua. Tá míniú an-éasca ar sin. Tá sé ceangailte roinnt mhaith le deontas na Roinne Comhshaoil agus bheadh sé deacair méadú a chur ar sin mura dtiocfadh méadú mar a chéile ar an deontas ón Roinn sin. Ba mhaith liom béim a chur ar cheist na gconraitheoirí agus ceist chostas na dtithe. Faoi láthair i mo Roinn féin, caithfidh gur conraitheoir cláraithe a dhéanann an obair de £5,000 de luach an tí agus go gcaithfidh £10,000 de dheimhniúcháin VAT a bheith ar fáil agus ina dhiaidh tá an duine ar a chonlán féin. Níl aon chosc ar dhuine dul ag obair ag tógáil a thí féin, rud atá an-tairbheach. Má tá meánchostas de £50,000 ag baint le teach a thógáil gan suíomh san áireamh, más féidir leis an duine cuid den obair sin a dhéanamh, rud a bhí coitianta san áit a bhfuil cónaí ormsa, sábháiltear an-chuid airgid. Ní foláir pluiméir agus leictreoir cáilithe a fháil ach is féidir leis an duine féin an-chuid den sclábhaíocht a dhéanamh. De bharr go bhfuil na costais chánach íseal, níl aon chosc ar dhaoine a gcuid oibre féin a dhéanamh ach go gcaithfidh conraitheoir cláraithe riar áirithe den obair a dhéanamh. Rud fíorshláintiúil agus dearfach é seo agus is minic go mbíodh na tithe a tógadh ar an gcaoi seo ar chaighdeán níos airde ná an teach a thóg conraitheoir.</P>
    <P>Tógadh ceist faoi na shailéanna saoire agus tá deireadh á chur leis an deontas seo. Má tá shailí saoire ann agus gur mhaith le duine caoi a chur air agus teach a dhéanamh de, is féidir an deontas feabhsúcháin a lorg, ach ní bheidh cead pleanála ar fáil a thuilleadh chun shailé saoire a thógáil as an nua. Cuirfidh sé ciall agus réasún leis na scéimeanna. Idir 1997 agus 2,000 shailé amháin a ceadaíodh agus bhí sé sin i gContae na Gaillimhe. Níl éileamh ar an scéim agus ar mhaithe le simplíocht is fearr é a thógáil amach.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta O'Shea béim i dtosach báire ar rud a bhí an-ghar do mo chroíse. ls é sin an riail go gcaithfeadh duine a bheith ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht chun teach a thógáil. Tógfaidh mé cúpla sampla faoi chásanna a tharla. Duine a bhí in árasán i nDún Gharbháin a bhí ag tógáil tí sa Rinn agus chuir sé an seoladh uimhir a trí, Bóthar Ard, Dún Gharbháin isteach. Bhí sé curtha as an deontas ar an bpoinnte. De réir na reachtaíochta ní raibh aon neart ag na stát seirbhísigh ar an bhfadhb sin. Sin mar a bhí sé leagtha síos. Tharla sé sin go mór mhór ar imeall na nGaeltachtaí mbeaga.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a bhí an-choitianta ná daoine i Meiriceá &ndash; rud a tharla go minic i mo dháilcheantar féin &ndash; nó i Sasana, a bhí ag teacht abhaile ag <Col N="892" /> iarraidh teach a thógáil agus togha na Gaeilge acu, Gaeilge á labhairt acu thar lear. Má chuir siad an chéad iarratas isteach leis an seoladh ceart stráinséara bhí siad curtha as an deontas.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam deireadh a chur leis sin ach ba mhaith liom fainic nó soiléiriú a dhéanamh ar an scéal. Séard atá á rá againn ná gur chuma cén áit a bhfuil cónaí ort nuair a chuireann tú isteach ar an deontas. Ach caithfidh mé béim a chur ar seo agus a bheith oscailte, cruinn agus cothrom faoi , ní íocfar an deontas go dtí go mbeidh an Roinn sásta gurb í an Ghaeilge teanga an teaghlaigh agus, freisin, go bhfuil buan chónaí sa teach.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, má tá Gaeilgeoirí ar fud na tíre ag ceapadh, agus Gaeilge mar theanga baile acu, gur féidir leo teach saoire a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus deontas Gaeltachta a fháil in a aghaidh, ní féidir leo muna n-athróidh siad go buan ón áit a bhfuil cónaí orthu go dtí an teach sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé sin soiléir mar níor mhaith liom éinne a chur amú ó thaobh na ceiste sin. Séard a bhí i gceist ná go gceadófaí an deontas agus go n-íocfaí é nuair a athródh an duine an seoladh buan go dtí an teach sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tógadh ceisteanna faoi chúrsaí teanga agus na rialacha teanga. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Teachta McGinley ag teacht ar ais mar thóg seisean an cheist seo. Is ceist acrannach í agus níl aon amhras faoi sin. Déanfaidh mé mo ghnó nuair a thógann Teachtaí ceisteanna suas liom, breathnú ar na códanna mé féin go minic a bhí le scrúdú. Seo mar atá an scéal. Is dóigh liom gur féidir linn na haicmí a bhriseadh i ndhá aicme. An chéad aicme ná an lanún nó an cúpla a bhfuil Gaeilge ag duine amháin ach gan aon Ghaeilge ag an duine eile agus gan aon ghasúr acu. Sa chás sin, is é a bheadh súil leis ná go mbeadh Gaeilge ag an mbeirt mar cén chaoi a d'fhéadfadh an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga ag an teaghlach muna mbeadh Gaeilge ag an mbeirt chun labhairt le chéile? Sa chás, nuair a dhéanfar scrúdú, nach gceaptar go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar chaighdeán sách ard le go gceadófaí an deontas séard a dhéanfar anois ná a rá go dtabharfar sé mhí nó bliain fiú, an t-am a theastódh ón duine féin, agus go dtiocfar ar ais faoin am sin agus an scrúdú a dhéanamh arís. Má táthar sásta go bhfuil iarracht fónta déanta agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge á úsáid mar theanga an teaghlaigh, ceadófar an deontas. Tá mé ag caint anois faoi lánún sa teach gan aon ghasúr.</P>
    <P>Sa chás gur teach nua é agus nach féidir an deontas a cheadú ag an bpoinnte sin, is féidir leo cur isteach ar dheontas an Roinn Comhshaoil. Níl aon neart agamsa ar rialacha an Roinn Comhshaoil má tá acra cearnach i gceist agus muna bhfuil an teach sa Ghaeltacht. Má shealbhaíonn siad an Ghaeilge mar theanga an teaghlaigh in a dhiaidh sin is féidir leo cur isteach ar an deontas spreagtha £800 agus mar sin ní bheidh de chaillteanas ann ach £200.</P>
    <P>Céard a tharlaíonn i gcás teaghlaigh &ndash; agus sílim go bhfuil sé seo fíor-thábhachtach? Éinne a <Col N="893" /> líon foirm riamh le haghaidh deontais do thithe Gaeltachta, chonaic sé go raibh dhá chuid leis an bhfoirm. Bhí an gnáth fhoirm agus ansin bhí an dara cuid agus cuireadh tuairisc maidir le cur isteach scéim labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Sé an chaoi a bhfuil sé liomsa ná gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí ó thaobh scéimeanna sa Ghaeltacht agus polasaithe i leith na Gaeltachta anois ná go ndéanfaimís an Ghaeilge a thógaint ar aghaidh go dtí an chéad ghlúin eile. Mar a deir siad sa mBearla, the intergenerational factor, the intergenerational transmission of the language. Sin an rud a bhfuil an béim ar fad agamsa air mar Aire.</P>
    <P>Sa chás a bhfuil teaghlach ann, go bhfuil gasúir sa teaghlach sin, go dtarlaíonn sé nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag duine amháin de na tuismitheoirí ach go sealbhaíonn na gasúir an Ghaeilge ón tuismitheoir a bhfuil Gaeilge aige nó aici agus mar sin go bhfuil siad cáilithe le haghaidh scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, de réir mar a thuigim é íoctar an deontas i gcónaí sa chás sin. An cheist atá ann ná an bhfuil an teaghlach ag tabhairt an teanga don chéad ghlúin eile. Níl aon mhaith do dhaoine le togha na Gaeilge teacht chugamsa nó do dhaoine eile ag rá go bhfuil fíor ghrá acu don teanga, a rá nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag bean a' tí nó ag fear a' tí ach go bhfuil sí acu féin, agus go bhfuil fíor ghrá acu don teanga, ach nach gcuirfeadh siad an dua orthu féin an teanga a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh soiléir in ainneoin rudaí a deirtear, agus tá sé fíor spéisiúil cuid de na códanna seo a léamh, má tá an Ghaeilge á sealbhú go sásúil ag na gasúir, má dhéantar iarracht an Ghaeilge a labhairt leis na gasúir, íoctar an deontas faoi scéim labhairt na Gaeilge sa chás sin. Muna bhfuil sí ag na gasúir agus muna bhfuil sí ach ag duine amháin sa teach agus muna bhfuil aon iarracht á dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar aghaidh go dtí an chéad ghlúin eile bheadh sé deacair faoi théarmaí na scéime a rá cén fáth go bhfaigheadh duine deontas Gaeltachta sa chás sin agus cén fáth nach bhfaigheadh duine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht an deontas céanna.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh go leor ceisteanna a ardaíonn ceisteanna i bhfad níos leithne maidir le teorannacha na Gaeltachta, todhchaí na Gaeltachta agus go leor rudaí eile nach é.</P>
    <P>Is cineál seafóid gur lean an rud seo ar aghaidh chomh fada leis seo. Chuir sé íontas orm nach raibh sé de spunk ag Airí a chuaigh romham deileáil leis an cheist seo uair amháin nó uair amháin eile. Sé an chaoi a raibh cúrsaí ná seo, ná go raibh deontais áirithe a tharla gur tugadh isteach iad roimh 1956 agus i ngeall ar sin go bhféadfaí cur isteach ar na deontais sin. Mar shampla, ní raibh an deontas do theach nua, de réir mar a thuigim, i gceist an uair sin. Bhí deontas le haghaidh tí nua má bhí sean teach suarach agat ach ní fhéadfá deontas a fháil le teach a thógáil do chlann nua. Bhain sé sin le réimeas post 1956 agus bhí an deontas maidir le sean teach suarach i bhfeidhm roimh 1956.</P>
    <P>Seo í an cheist. Dá mbeadh tú ag iarraidh a bheith réasúnta, loighchiúil agus ciallmhar faoi <Col N="894" /> seo chaithfeá a rá má bhí duine sa Chreagán nó i gContae an Chláir nó in aon áit eile i dteidil deontas le haghaidh sean teach suarach a dhéanamh ina theach nua cén fáth nach raibh siad i dteidil réimse iomlán deontas na Gaeltachta? Sin ceist. Chaithfeá dul ceann den dá bhealach. Níl aon chiall a rá má tharla go raibh an rud ann roimh 1956 go raibh cineál áirithe deontais ann ach nach raibh an cineál eile deontais ann mar gur tugadh isteach roimh 1956 é agus go bhfágfaimis an status quo sin ann. Níl aon chiall leis an seasamh sin.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael a thóg isteach Acht 1956 mar más buan mo chuimhne iad a bhí i gcumhacht ag an am sin.</P>

      <P>Fear thar a bheith iomráiteach a chuir isteach go leor breac-Ghaeltachtaí go dtí an fíor-Ghaeltacht i mo chontae féin agus tá an-eolas ag an Teachta Ó hUiginn ar sin.</P>
      <P>Séard a bhí ann ná go raibh Gaeltachtaí 1929 ann agus má bhí an deontas ann roimh 1956 bhíothas i dteideal an deontais. Feictear domsa go bhfuil sé in am againn má táimid ag coinneáil coincheap an deontais go mbunófaí chuile rud ar alt 56. Sin a cheapaimse atá réasúnta. Agus tá cead ag an Rialtas, mar a déanadh i gcás Ráth Cairn agus Baile Ghib sna seascaidí, ceantar a chur isteach nó amach as an nGaeltacht, agus tharla sé sa seanphobal freisin. Mar sin má tá ceantair taobh amuigh de na limistéir Gaeltachta mar atá siad i láthair na huaire agus a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt iontu, ba cheart dóibh iarracht a dhéanamh go n-áireofaí mar Ghaeltacht iad faoi na hAchtanna atá ann i láthair na huaire. Ach ní léir seo ach i gcúpla DED ar imeall na Gaeltachta agus tá na staitisticí scrúdaithe agam. Tá ceist ann faoi imeall na Gaeltachta mar trí phósadh agus eile tá daoine le Béarla agus bogadh isteach agus daoine le Gaeilge ag bogadh amach. Feictear é sin go láidir i gceantair ar nós Uachtar Ard mar níl sé ach trasna an chnoic ón nGaeltacht agus tagann daoine chun cónaithe ann. D'fheicfeá go leor daoine taobh amuigh de limistéar na Gaeltachta anois go bhfuil Gaeilge acu mar go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó bogadh de bharr cúrsaí oibre ná mar a bhí.</P>
      <P>Má táthar ag iarraidh cás a dhéanamh go mba chóir breathnú ar theorainneacha na Gaeltachta, tá coimisiún Gaeltachta ag suí faoi láthair agus seo ceann de na téarmaí tagartha atá acu. Is futhu atá sé a shocrú cén chaoi ar chóir na limistéir sin a rianadh, agus na critéir a ba cheart a úsáid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá dearcadh an-oscailte agam ar an gceist seo agus baineann sé go mór leis an gceist atá á plé inniu againn. Dá leanfaimis beartas an chúngaithe, ní bheadh aon Ghaeltacht fágtha ar deireadh. Agus teastaíonn buffer zones fiú má tá an Ghaeilge lag iontu ar imeall na Gaeltacht, ina mbeadh an Ghaeilge á cur chun cinn ar bhealach an-dearfach. Ba cheart a fhiafraí de phobal ar imeall na Gaeltachta, ar mhaith libh stádas Gaelt<Col N="895" /> acht agus seo hiad na rudaí a chaithfear a dhéanamh leis an stádas sin a bhaint amach. Agus thabharfaí stádas sealadach dóibh ar dtús agus dá mbeadh ceátadán áirithe den phobal sásta glacadh leis na coinníollacha go mór mór ó thaobh Gaeilge a thabhairt do na daoine óga, bhreathnófaí go báúil ar a leithéid de choincheap.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Gilmore go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge i mBaile Átha Cliath ná mar atá sna Gaeltachtaí ach ní sheasann na figiúirí dó sin. Níl sé sin fíor. Má dhéantar scrúdú ar na figiúirí do líon na gcainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge, ag fágáil gasúir scoile as an áireamh, gheofar amach go bhfuil i bhfad Éireann níos mó daoine ag caint Gaeilge fiú sna Gaeltachtaí laga ná mar atá sna cathracha go laethúil. Ní chóir dúinn áibhéil a dhéanamh faoi chomh maith is atá an Ghaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Ainneoin an rud a cheaptar, tá níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt go laethúil sa cheantar sin de chathair na Gaillimhe atá sa Ghaeltacht ná mar atá taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Bhí ionadh orm féin ach ar ndóigh an dream a bhog isteach sa chathair ón nGaeltacht, cheannaigh siad tithe sa cheantar sin mar bhí deontais Ghaeltachta le fáil acu.</P>
    <P>Tógadh go leor ceisteanna tábhachtacha maidir le ceannach suíomhanna agus na deacrachtaí agus an praghsanna. Tithe Gaeltachta amháin atá faoi chaibidil anseo inniu. Tá go leor daoine fós sa Ghaeltach arbh fhéidir leo suíomh a fháil ó athair nó máthair, nó gaol eile agus tá sé tábhachtach go leanfaimid linn ag tabhairt chuile thacaíocht do na daoine sin cead pleanála a fháil. Ainneoin aon rud a cheapann Páirtí an Lucht Oibre, tá buncheart ag duine cead pleanála a fháil ar a gcuid talún féin chun teach a thógáil. Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ar aon tuairim liom faoi sin sna rialacha atá á moladh acu.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil glún óg ag fás aníos sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil ag a dtuismitheoirí ach suíomh an tí ina bhfuil siad agus go gcaithfear ceist na suíomhanna a phlé. Tá dhá bhealach ar féidir tabhairt faoi. Bealach amháin ná tithe comhairle contae agus tá obair á déanamh i nGaillimh mar shampla chun suíomhanna a cheannach le haghaidh low-cost housing a bheas ar fáil don phobal atá ar ioncam íseal, ar £100 an tsuímh le tithe a thógáil orthu agus tógfaidh na daoine na tithe iad féin. An-scéim é sin.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, tá áthas orm a rá agus an Teachta Ó Muineacháin ina shuí taobh thiar díom, gur cheadaigh mé don údarás suíomh a cheannach chun críche tithíocht do sheandaoine ar an gcoinníoll go n-úsáidfí é ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge sa nGaeltacht. Ní bheadh cead reachtúil ag an Údarás é a cheannach ar aon choinníoll eile. Briseadh le traidisiún a bhí ansin agus rud nár ceadaíodh go hoifigiúil riamh roimhe sin. Ach caithfidh an túdarás breathnú ar na fadhbanna ginearálta pobail agus briseadh amach ó na seanmúnlaí. Tabharfaidh mé cúnamh dóibh é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Má thagann iarratas go dtí an túdarás le talamh a cheannach chun tithíocht a chur ar fáil do lucht <Col N="896" /> labhartha na Gaeilge sa nGaeltacht, daoine óga atá ag iarraidh cur futhu sa Ghaeltacht agus a bheadh i dteideal deontas a fháil ó mo Roinnse do theach nua, agus má thagann an túdarás chughamsa leis an gcead a fháil, i bprionsabal táim sásta an cead sin a thabhairt. Mar tá ról ag an údarás san obair seo agus má tá eagraíochtaí pobail ag iarraidh leas a bhaint as scéimeanna sóisialta den chineál sin, ar an mbealach sin, gheobhaidh siad éisteach bháúil uaimse. Tá mé ag iarraidh an géarchéim tithíochta atá ann i gcuid de na Gaeltachtaí a leigheas, chomh fada agus is féidir liom.</P>
    <P>I gcuid de na ceantair níl an géarchéim chomh dona agus nílim cinnte arbh fhearr go mbeadh sé. Labhair mé leis an gcomhairle contae faoin gceantar beag ina bhfuil cónaí orm féin agus níl an t-éileamh chomh mór sa cheantar sin. B'fhéidir gur comhartha é nach bhfuil dóthain daoine óga ag bogadh isteach agus ag fanacht ainneoin go bhfuil ceann de na rátaí is airde fostaíochta sa tír sa cheantar céanna.</P>
    <P>Tógadh ceisteanna maidir le cúrsaí tógála. Mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó hUiginn, nílimid ag plé le mórchonraitheoirí sa Ghaeltacht, don chuid is mó. An gnáthchonraitheoir sa Ghaeltacht, is comharsa béal dorais do dhuine éigin é, agus é ag tógáil teach anseo is ansiúd. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé féaráilte a rá go bhfuil éinne anseo ag iarraidh níos mó ná airgead réasúnta. Ach ag gach leibhéal de chúrsaí tithíochta, tá daoine ann atá ag éirí santach. Tá an dream a bhfuil na suíomhanna acu ag iarraidh praghas ard agus ar ndóigh tá lucht ceirde ann freisin. Bheadh súil agam nach mbeadh muide sa deireadh maidir le cúrsaí praghais sa tír seo ar nós an té fadó a mharaigh an gé a raibh na huibheacha órga aici. Tá a fhios againn nach raibh aon uibheacha ann níos mó ina dhiaidh sin. Nach fearr i bhfad a bheith ag déanamh brabach deas ag chuile leibhéal den ghnó seo thar tréimhse ama le go mbeadh beagáinín fágtha nuair a thiocfaidh an drochuair. Tógadh ceist faoi scéimeanna tithe samhraidh. Nuair a bhí mé ag cur deireadh leis an deontas don dara teach nua mar gur chreid mé nach raibh sé ceart go mbeadh a leithéid sa Ghaeltacht nuair nach raibh sé in áit ar bith eile sa tír, chinn mé nach gcuirfinn deireadh leis an deontas le hathchóiriú a dhéanamh ar an dara teach más athchóiriú ar sheanteach a bhí i gceist.</P>
    <P>An fáth ná seo. Tuigimid go léir an imirce agus an bánú a tharla sa Ghaeltacht agus an méid fothracha atá ann ar fud na tuaithe, fothracha a d'fhéadfaí a thabhairt ar ais ach beagáinín cúnaimh a fháil. Tuigimid freisin go bhfuil cathú ar dhaoine na tithe seo a dhíol le strainséirí. Dá ndíolfaí, ní bheadh a luach arís ag a gclann siadsan ná ag clann a gclainne. Ar an ábhar sin chinn mé go gcoinneofaí an deontas le caoi a chur ar an dara teach. Tá súil agam go bhfeicfidh muintir na Gaeltachta agus na n-oileán gur rud dearfach atá anseo, agus go mbreathnóidh siad ar na tithe seo mar acmhainn clainne. De bhrí go bhfuil deontas <Col N="897" /> i gceist ní bheidh siad in ann iad a dhíol agus d'aonturas atá sé sin ann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Mhínigh mé é sin. Ní raibh ach iarratas amháin ar shailé againn ó 1997 le shailé nua a thógáil. Ach má tá shailé ann agus má táthar ag iarraidh é a chóiriú le cineál tí a dhéanamh de, níl fadhb ann. Tá deireadh curtha leis na shailé nua a thógáil, ach an oiread leis an dara teach a thógáil.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an athchóiriú ar shailé nó tithe, acmhainn iontach a bheas ann. Abair go bhfuil seanteach ansin ag teaghlach a bhog siad as fiche nó tríocha bliain ó shin, má chuireann siad caoi air, tig leo é a ligint ar cíos. Ar nós an ghé ar ball, beidh an gé seo acu i gcónaí. Ach má thagann an lá go mbíonn iníon nó mac ag iarraidh bogadh isteach sa teach seo, beidh teach ann dóibh. Nach fearr i bhfad é sin ná go mbeimis ag áiteamh ar dhaoine na seansuíomhanna seo a dhíol. Chomhairleoinn do na Teachtaí anseo breathnú ar phlean Chontae na Gaillimhe áit a ndearnamar soláthar speisialta sna rialacha pleanála le haghaidh ceaduithe pleanála chun seantithe a athchóiriú do chúrsaí saoire.</P>
      <P>Labhair an Teachta M. Higgins faoi thithíocht phoiblí. Ní athraíonn dualgas na comhairle contae leis an reachtaíocht seo, ar chor ar bith. B'fhéidir go bhfuil pointe aige nuair a deir sé go mba cheart cuid den obair a thabhairt don údarás nó go mba cheart go mbeadh údaráis áitiúla ann don Ghaeltacht, mar a dúirt mé ag an deireadh seachtaine.</P>
      <P>Ach ní fhaighim aon éileamh ar chúraimí tithíochta a aistriú ón Roinn go dtí an tÚdarás, agus níl i gceist agam é sin a dhéanamh. Déanann oifigigh na Roinne cúram an-mhaith de na cúraimí atá orthu. Is maith go mbeadh baint ag an Teach seo agus ag an Aire leis an scéal.</P>
      <P>Tógadh ceist maidir le hathchóiriú tithe chun críocha cumhacht faoi Alt 9 den Bhille. Má thógtar scéim nua isteach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, is féidir a mhacasamhail a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht anois gan reachtaíocht nua. Is iomaí scéim a tugadh isteach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus ní rabhamar in ann an rud céanna a dhéanamh taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht agus bhí ar mhuintir na Gaeltacht an scéim amuigh a úsáid. An rud atá ráite faoi aimhleas na Gaeilge anseo ná má thugtar aon scéim nua isteach faoin alt seo, ná go gcaithfidh coinníollach Gaeilge a bheith ann a chinnteoidh nach feidhmeoidh an scéim seo chun aimhleas na Gaeilge. Murach sin, ní bheadh na scéimeanna go léir ag teacht le chéile, bheadh rialacha daingne Gaeilge ag scéimeanna áirithe amháin.</P>
      <P>Coinníoll caighdeánach é seo go bhfuil cead an Aire Airgeadais ag teastáil sula dtabharfaí isteach aon scéim ach tuigeann aon Aire a bhí ann iriamh go mbíonn cead na Roinne Airgeadais ag teastáil le haghaidh beagnach rud ar bith. Ní miste an cheist seo a chíoradh beagnach agus a lua go bhfuil soláthar méadaithe ann anois.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> In aimsir an Chomhrialtais dheiridh, bhí deireadh leis na deontais fheabhsúcháin agus bhí srian á chur isteach. Bhí an rud ar fad ag imeacht mar a fheictear ó na figiúirí. I 1997 an bhliain tar éis gur cuireadh deireadh le cuid mhaith rudaí, níor caitheadh ach £1,375,00 ar thithíocht Ghaeltachta. Anuraidh caitheadh beagnach 2 mhilliún punt agus níos tábhachtaí fós, de bharr na n-athruithe a tugadh isteach, ceadaíodh £2,700,000 de dheontais tithíochta sa Ghaeltachta anuraidh agus bíonn moill idir deontas á fhógairt agus é á íoc amach nuair atá an t-iarratas faighte.</P>
    <P>Táimid tar éis na deontais sin a mhéadú ó shin ag deireadh na bliana agus mar sin beidh an caiteachas sin ag dul suas arís. Ainneoin aon rud a dúradh faoi thréimhsí Rialtais eile, níl fadhb ar bith agamsa leis an Roinn Airgeadais agus tá siad an-réasúnta liom agus is léir go bhfuil siad sásta cur go mór leis an méid a bhí ann don nGaeltacht agus is mar sin a leanfaidh sé.</P>
    <P>Maidir le húinéireacht cuirtear na rialacha i bhfeidhm chomh tuisceanach agus chomh féaráilte agus is féidir. Ach tá bunrudaí áirithe ann nach féidir éalú uathu. Caithfidh duine úinéireacht a bheith aici nó aige má tá siad ag dul ag fáil deontais. Níor thuig mé go baileach an fhadhb a luaigh an Teachta M. Higgins maidir leis an mháthair chéile agus an iníon chéile. Ba leor sa chás sin go mbeadh an teideal ag duine de na daoine a bhí ina gcónaí sa teach. Ba chuma faoi scéimeanna na Roinne cé acu an raibh an teideal acu, an tseanmháthair, na gasúir, nó máthair na ngasúr. Ach abair nach gcaithfeadh teideal a bheith ag duine. Bheadh go leor daoine ag cur isteach ar dheontais agus fadhbanna móra ann dá mbarr.</P>
    <P>Tugann oifigigh na Roinne an-chúnamh do dhaoine chun na rudaí seo a shortáil amach agus ní bhíonn siad riamh níos lú ná tuisceanach ag tabhairt cúnamh do dhaoine le folios, agus athrú teidil agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Tógadh ceist faoin fhadhb atá ag daoine le foirmeacha. Tá go leor foirmeacha ag éirí níos casta in aghaidh an lae agus ní bheadh a fhios agat cad is cúis le leath de na ceisteanna. Ni hamhlaidh i gcás na foirmeacha Gaeltachta. Bhí roinnt rudaí faoi na foirmeacha a thóg mé le hoifigigh na Roinne. Iarrtar ainm, sloinne, seoladh, aois. uimhir fóin, dáta breithe (agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil gá le seo a thuilleadh) an uimhir atá sa teaghlach, buachaillí, cailíní, mná agus fir, uimhir an folio, an í an Ghaeilge an ghnáth-theanga labhartha, an bhfuil aon deontas eile á lorg don obair. Ar an gcéad leathanach eile tá boiscíní ann le ticeáil faoi cé acu deontas a bhfuiltear ag cur isteach air. Caithfear eolas a sholáthar maidir leis an gconraitheoir atá ag déanamh na hoibre, sínítear é, síníonn finné, cuirtear an dáta air agus sin sin. Má tá gasúr sa teach, caithfear an fhoirm bheag bhídeach maidir le scéim labhairt na Gaeilge a líonadh.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam ar thug na Teachtaí faoi deara gur athraigh mé rud a chuireadh go leor daoine ar strae, sé sin, go mbítí ag lorg an uimhir agus an ceantar cánach. Ach ar na foirmeacha nua tá na litreacha RSI, tar éis go dtuigim go bhfuil sé sin le hathrú anois, curtha i ndiaidh uimhir chán<Col N="899" /> ach mar tuigeann daoine anois cad atá i gceist. Céim sa treo ceart ab ea é sin mar sin a thugtar air go coitianta.</P>
    <P>Tá mé sásta i gcónaí i gcomhar le hoifigigh na Roinne athruithe a chur ar fhoirmeacha agus tá soláthar sa Bhille seo chuige seo. Tá mé féin agus an fhoireann sa Roinn sásta i gcónaí na foirmeacha a dhéanamh níos inúsáidte agus tá a laghad eolas a iarraidh ar na foirmeacha anois gur beag eile is féidir a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Mar tá dlí ag an Roinn Airgeadais a deir má chuireann duine isteach ar dheontas go gcaithfear an uimhir chánach a lua. An cheist a chuirfinn ar ais ná nach eol dom cén fáth nach ionann an uimhir phinsin agus an uimhir chánach. Faighim an uimhir chánach do dhaoine ón uimhir phinsin. Glacaim le pointe an Teachta agus níl mórán is féidir a dhéanamh faoi sin.</P>
      <P>Thóg an Teachta Daly ceist faoi dheontais i gContae an Chláir á rá go bhfuil na rialacha ró-dhian. Táimid ar ais ag Acht na bliana 1929. Níl na rialacha níos déine ó thaobh na Gaeilge de ná mar atá siad in aon áit eile sa Ghaeltacht. Níl aon riail faoi leith atá dian sna limistéirí 1929.</P>
      <P>Since 1929 to 2000, more than 70 years, the total amount of grants paid to applicants for Gaeltacht housing in County Clare amounts to £45,833. It is important to say in relation to the abolishment of the 1929 regions, where people might feel there was some éagóir in it, it was more of a mirage than a reality; it was more a teaser than something of which a large number of people availed.</P>
      <P>Tá figiúirí agam freisin don tréimhse ó 1990 go dtí an bhliain 2000. Bhí trí gcinn le haghaidh feabhsúcháin i gContae an Chláir, fuinneoga agus doirse i gceann amháin, seomra folctha i gceann eile agus sin an méid a baineadh leas as. Aisteach go leor, agus níl an Teachta Smith anseo, íocadh cás amháin &ndash; £40 &ndash; faoin scéim seo i gContae an Chábháin &ndash; níl a fhios agam conas a tharla sé sin. Go ginearálta cé go mothaíonn daoine go bhfuil éagóir á déanamh tá sé in am againn an rud seo a dhéanamh ar bhealach ciallmhar stuama le go mbeadh loighic ag baint leis na rialacha. Má tá ceist faoi is ceist faoi na teorainneacha Gaeltachta í agus ní faoin deontas a bheith ar fáil. Má tá teaghlach le Gaeilge i nDún Laoghaire nó i dTamhlacht agus má tá an deontas ar fáil i gContae an Chláir atá taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht mar a shonraítear anois é, ba chóir go mbeadh sé acu siúd freisin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin asked why fishermen and small farmers on the mainland were not receiving it. The increased grant in the islands does not relate to income. If it related to income, then there would be a means test. The increased <Col N="900" /> grant for the offshore islanders to build houses relates to the cost of bringing the blocks, cement, doors, windows and so on to the island. Building costs on islands are horrendously expensive because of the transport aspect. The purpose of the increased grant to the islands is to cover transport costs in bringing the goods to the islands. It has nothing to do with income, it has to do with equality in terms of the cost of building a house on an island. Those who are not familiar with the offshore islands have no idea of the costs involved in this regard.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na hiasachtaí, is é a bhí ann i dtús ama, ná iasacht punt ar phunt leis an deontas. Má fuair tú £4,000 de dheontas fuair tú £4,000 d'iasacht chomh maith. Bhí sé sin go breá nuair a fhéadfaí teach a thógáil sna tríochaidí ar chúpla míle punt, bhí an-chiall leis na hiasachtaí. Ach tháinig maolú ar an éileamh ar iasachtaí thar imeacht ama. Mar le hiasacht de £4,000 a fháil  &ndash; agus ní fhéadfadh éinne teach a thógáil ar £8,000  &ndash; bhí bunáite phobal na Gaeltachta ag brath ar iasachtaí bainc in éineacht leis &ndash; chaithfeá glacadh le morgáiste ar an folio, ar theideal an tí. Is mó mar a chuireadh sé sin as don té a bhí ag lorg iasachta bainc ná mar a bhí sé ag déanamh leasa.</P>
    <P>Níor tugadh amach aon iasacht sa Ghaeltacht le cúpla bliain anuas. Íocadh cúpla ceann ach níor cheadaíodh aon cheann nua. Níorbh fhiú an t-am agus an trioblóid nuair a bhí sé níos éasca iasacht bhainc a fháil gan aon mhorgáiste. Tá soláthar sa Bhille seo chun déileáil le dhá rud. Táimid ag cur deireadh le hiasachtaí nua ach tá riar mhaith airgid amuigh ag an Roinn. Ceadaíodh £386,000 d'iasachtaí ó 1990 go 2000 agus sa tréimhse chéanna níor íocadh ar ais ach £362,000 d'iasachtaí agus le hús san áireamh is léir nach bhfuilimid ag fáil an caipiteal fiú ar ais. Tá cuid de na hiasachtaí chomh beag nach bhfuil daoine á n-íoc.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid é seo a ghlanadh suas agus tá deis faoin mBille seo na hiasachtaí beaga seo a dhíscríobh, nó má tá deacracht ag duine iasacht a aisíoc de bharr báis mar shampla tá deis ann rialacha a thabhairt isteach a mhaolóidh an rud. Rud an-dearfach é sin ar fad. Nach fearr i bhfad deontas méadaithe agus é a íoc amach in airgead tirim agus gan a bheith ag útamáil timpeall le riarachán iasachtaí? Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis na Teachtaí ar fad. Beidh tuilleadh plé againn ar Chéim an Choiste agus molaim anois go gcuirfear ar aghaidh anois é ag an gCoiste Gaeilge le plé ag Céim an Choiste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 January of this year, the executive chairperson of Sports Campus Ireland, Mr. Paddy Teahon, wrote to the chairperson of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Breda Moynihan-Cronin, to apologise to her for misleading the Committee on 14 September 2000 concerning the cost of the national stadium. Mr. Teahon went on to say that his incorrect figures were &ldquo;subsequently reflected in briefing material used by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation when replying to Parliamentary Questions in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite remarkable that Mr. Teahon misled the committee on September 14 last, and subsequently the Taoiseach and the Minister, but did not discover his error until it was highlighted in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme two weeks ago. Anyone can make a mistake, but it is remarkable that Mr. Teahon's memory of an event which occurred on 14 September was only triggered following the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. The erroneous figure has been repeated in countless print media and yet Mr. Teahon, whose principal focus is supposed to be the stadium project, did not ever query the origins of the figure nor sought to correct it. When it was used and relied on by Members on both sides of the House on several occasions, there was still no correction forthcoming. When Mr. Teahon and his colleagues met the Labour Party leader, Deputy Quinn, myself and other colleagues on 26 October 2000 &ndash; some nine days after the exchanges in the House &ndash; he made no attempt to correct the figure. However, when &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; showed a video recording of the Taoiseach misleading the House at Question Time on 17 October, Mr. Teahon suddenly discovered that he was the author of the incorrect figures.</P>
      <P>Frankly, it beggars belief that not just the Opposition but the Taoiseach and the responsible Minister were allowed to proceed on an artificial figure based on an error of no less than £51 million. The kindest conclusion to which one can come is that nobody cares how much this project costs the taxpayer. It does not seem to matter how many noughts are added to the bottom line. The Taoiseach wants his vanity project and he will get it. Is it not remarkable that neither the Minister responsible, the Taoiseach who is promoting the project or the management charged with delivering it noticed an error of £51 million in the costings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises questions about the reliance that can be placed on the remainder of the figures relating to this project. We now know from the <Col N="903" /> data secured under the Freedom of Information Act that the alarming cost of clearing the park has escalated from £90 million to £160 million. Can Members imagine anyone entering the House a number of years ago with a proposal to clear the park at such a cost? In the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Mr. Teahon referred to the BSE situation being so serious that this would be warranted in any event. I do not believe anyone would seriously buy into that.</P>
    <P>In the same article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 January, in setting up an escape hatch for the Taoiseach who had misled the House, Mr. Teahon calmly records that &ldquo;the Stadium cost (£230 million) had not changed, but the campus cost had.&rdquo;  He proceeds to say that the &ldquo;initial guideline cost of £51 million for a Stadium of sporting excellence&rdquo; had now become &ldquo;a sound estimate of the cost of the campus is £320 million.&rdquo; Just like that. We were given an explanation as to how £281 million became £230 million and now we have been provided with an explanation to show how £51 million became £320 million. The cost of the stadium will remain at £230 million &ndash; although we have empirical evidence to the contrary &ndash; while the cost of the campus has risen from £51 million to £320 million. Add in the cost of clearing the site at £160 million and the total cost has already reached £710 million.</P>
    <P>The flat percentage rate system payable under the contract to the interests associated with delivering the project means that the higher that figure goes, the larger the amount of money those interests will extract from it. In addition to the £50 million supposedly committed by the J. P. McManus syndicate, Mr. Teahon hopes &ldquo;the private sector will be prepared to invest £150 million in the project, mostly for commercial facilities.&rdquo; However, we have just seen the FAI being forced into partnership talks with the private sector because it could not stack up the economics due to the fact that some members of its board were not prepared to proceed on the basis of promises from the corporate sector. What is the status of the promise that a further £150 million will be forthcoming from the private sector for Abbotstown?</P>
    <P>All of this and no anchor tenant. The Comptroller and Auditor General in France has just completed a study on the fiasco associated with the construction of the <i>Stade de France</i> for the World Cup. The problem that arose in France was that after the World Cup there was no anchor tenant for the stadium. Paris St. Germain refused to take up occupancy of this 80,000 seater stadium and there is now available on the Internet a report by the French Comptroller and Auditor General about this debacle, which arose as a result of the fact that there was no anchor tenant to finance the ongoing operations of the stadium.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Taoiseach's men believe that they will ultimately be able to make the FAI an offer it cannot refuse. However, what if the FAI proceeds on a joint venture basis with Eir<Col N="904" /> com Park? Even if it does not, do we have to spend the sports budget for the next ten years on the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;? We already have an 80,000 seater Stadium at Croke Park, towards the cost of which the Exchequer has made some contribution. The FAI wants to build its own stadium possibly necessarily in partnership with the private sector. Lansdowne Road remains an ideally located ground. If we need another stadium, we most certainly do not need two. There simply are not enough events to pay the bills.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the sports infrastructure throughout the country, desperately needs investment. Voluntary activists are struggling to raise money and provide what are often basic facilities for all kinds of sporting clubs. A fraction of this money could transform sporting endeavour in local communities.</P>
    <P>Initially I supported this project. I thought it was a good idea to build such a stadium. At that time the £50 million supposedly committed by J.P. McManus was a generous gift from someone who spent most of his life avoiding paying tax here. However, we will not look a gift horse in the mouth. That £50 million was a major proportion of the cost at the time but it would not buy the perimeter fence now.</P>
    <P>The cost of this project has escalated beyond belief and will starve the ability to put money into ordinary clubs up and down the country for the next ten years. The most important point of all is that, while we will be able to sign the cheque, how are we going to run the stadium? From where will the events come?</P>
    <P>It seems rational that if we must have another stadium it ought to be more comparable in cost to the stadia built across the West in recent years. In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> I set out a table detailing the costs from Munich to Dublin over the past number of years. Deputy O'Shea drew attention to the American study which showed an average overrun of 73.4% on 15 stadia recently built in the US. I cannot see how Mr. Teahon can claim the cost will remain static.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate which is the second time we have examined sport in recent times. I was taken by many contributions to this debate, particularly by that of Deputy Deenihan. The Deputy made an honest and open admission that when Fine Gael spokesperson on sport he was in favour of this kind of project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this project is rigorously examined. However, we should also try to set our prejudices aside when discussing this issue. I have great respect for Deputy Rabbitte but the proposed site at Abbotstown was identified as the site for the national business park some years <Col N="905" /> ago. That park is now located at Citywest which is near if not in Deputy Rabbitte's constituency. Eircom Park, the FAI's proposed stadium, will be in roughly the same location. However, I am not suggesting Deputy Rabbitte's views are tinted by what might benefit his constituency.</P>
    <P>The debate on this issue is reminiscent of debates regarding, for example, the restoration of Dublin Castle, the bringing on stream of the Royal Hospital, Government Buildings and Knock Airport which were derided as unrealisable dreams by some. However, everyone is now claiming credit for those ideas and the work carried out on them.</P>
    <P>I do not think the same derision would be heaped on this proposal if we were talking about locating the national centre for the performing arts or a national gallery or national library at Abbotstown. There are times when there is a class snobbishness about this debate in that sport is for the ordinary person and not regarded as part of the finer things in life. Certain locations endured the same kind of derision when they looked for projects such as those I mentioned. Limerick was a case in point when it looked for a university. There was also a ferocious battle over the siting of NIHE Dublin, now DCU.</P>
    <P>Like any other endeavour, sport ought to have levels of excellence from participation at the most basic level, whether by playing games and giving up at the age of 13 or 14, to move on to a more sedentary occupation such as golf. However, there has to be a place where the best talent can be exhibited. That is what the national stadium is about and what the discussion ought to be about. We are not talking about just another football stadium. We are talking about, for example, swimming facilities for which planning permission has been sought. Hopefully the swimming pool will be ready for the 2003 Special Olympics.</P>
    <P>We are also talking about a variety of indoor and outdoor facilities and sports medicine training facilities. There will also be headquarters for sporting organisations. I am not sure if the house of sport is still on the Long Mile Road. That building was leased by smaller sporting organisations which divided the office space. Those organisations do not have national headquarters and can be located at the new facility. The Irish Ice Hockey Association has to travel to Newry or Enniskillen to participate in its sport. Such facilities can be concentrated at the new national stadium.</P>
    <P>The stadium for the Sydney Olympics was built largely on a landfill site and such a site at Dunsink is part of the proposed location for the national stadium. This project will grow organically but not much of it will be delivered within the lifetime of this or the next Government. It will be many years before the whole complex is in place but I am anxious that this area of north-west and west Dublin benefits by way of significant infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>There will be a large housing development at Pelletstown, not far from the proposed site of the <Col N="906" /> stadium. The airport is also close by and it is important that we construct a rail line linking the city centre, Pelletstown and Dublin Airport, taking in the stadium. Such a link will be provided and will add significantly to the infrastructure which many of us would like to see. Some people may be mischievously ignoring the fact that this infrastructural development will be an additional benefit for the community in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of also promoting sport at other levels. The Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, is in the House. I pay tribute to him and the Minister, Deputy McDaid, for their investment in sport. I also pay tribute to Deputy Rabbitte for his work when he held the drugs portfolio. The youth services and facilities fund kick-started many positive developments, the results of which we are now seeing. Only today I saw some of the progress being made in Dublin. For example, the swimming pool in Ballyfermot is being extensively used. I hate to be parochial, but work will commence in May on a multiplex in Finglas providing a swimming pool, child care facilities, youth centre and indoor and outdoor facilities to be delivered within 18 months. This complex will cater for young people who have to train and play in less than satisfactory conditions, without proper shower facilities or whatever. These facilities are being delivered.</P>
    <P>A new pool is being planned for Ballymun. There is also significant investment in existing football and other sports clubs. Throughout the country there is a growing level of investment in infrastructure. This is the important second layer which is being put in place. The first layer in which I wish to see more investment, is under-age sport. Apart from the £10 million the Sports Council has to spend on sport, £2.5 million was made available to the national governing bodies of sport, the GAA, the FAI and IRFU, in the budget to encourage greater participation by young people in sport and £0.5 million was made available to encourage greater participation by older people. I call on those organisations to spend that money substantially in areas of disadvantage, where people have not had a chance of making a clean break.</P>
    <P>If we invest in the provision of facilities at community and regional level, it makes sense to provide facilities for excellence to attract significant tournaments to this country. That is an industry in that thousands of people travel to see the Superbowl and millions of people travel to see the Olympics, the Special Olympics and the Winter Olympics. Therefore, significant tournaments could benefit our economy and lead to the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>I am not in the least concerned about the rigorous examination this project is undergoing. That is only right. I support its examination, but it deserves all party support because it is needed as part of our sports infrastructure.</P>

      <P>While I might not always agree with some of the issues Opposition parties raise, <Col N="907" /> I often understand their point in raising them, even if I vote against the motion tabled. However, on this issue, I cannot understand the objection from Fine Gael and to a lesser extent from Labour to the building of a national stadium. It does not make sense. If anything, we on this side of the House hear the Opposition parties talk about the slowness of the implementation of the national development plan, the lack of infrastructure, etc., and we all share some of those sentiments, but when it comes to somebody doing something about a project &ndash; the Government is moving ahead on the national stadium and campus &ndash; the Opposition says it is against it. That does not make sense. I am trying to be fair and objective. I accept that on other occasions I might have said the Opposition was wrong about its position on an issue while privately I might have thought it was right, but in this case by any criteria, including its own, its actions have been crazy. I do not know from where the policy or objection came and why the Opposition continues to run with it. The only summary of it seems to be the notion that, &ldquo;you lot are doing it, therefore, we are against it&rdquo;. It is totally illogical and quite often members of Fine Gael talk about vision and the lack of it but this is a case where vision has been shown on this side of the House, yet the Opposition seems to be against the project and to have adopted a small minded attitude. I suggest it bounces its policy off some non-party, fair minded people, be they involved in sport or otherwise, and I think it would get a fairly negative response as most people think this project is a great idea.</P>
      <P>Some people say it is wrong to put the money into a national campus, that it should be put into clubs at local and regional levels. I was sports mad at one stage. I am all for money being invested in sport at all levels, and that is happening. Every constituency has been given generous grants in recent years. There is a Department with responsibility for sport which I hope will continue under future Governments. Responsibility for sport does not come under the Department of Education and Science, as it did in the past; it is a separate Department fighting its own battle and securing money for sport at all levels. If Members were fair, they would acknowledge that the problem experienced by clubs has been in trying to spend the money they have been allocated under the former Rainbow Coalition and under this Government. Many clubs that have sought funding have only drawndown a portion of the money allocated due to the difficulty of getting builders to do the work, and that is an ongoing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money is being provided for sport at all levels. Deputy Carey, with whom I share a constituency, mentioned some of the facilities in our patch, but the same argument in terms of the youth facilities and services fund and sports grants could be made in respect of facilities in any other constituency. A major project is under way in Finglas and I hope a similar one will be located in Ballymun. There is also the new indoor arena for Santry Stadium. I am sure Members could rattle off major <Col N="908" /> projects in their constituencies as well as the sports clubs at different levels that have been allocated generous grants. Everyone who plays sports deserves access to proper facilities. Too often when we were young many of us had to tog out in facilities that were sadly lacking, but matters have moved on and many people involved in various sports have access to good facilities. It is not a case of there being one big national stadium or spreading the money around. Thankfully, we can do both and we are doing both. That should not be lose sight of.</P>
    <P>This project started off as the national stadium and many of us are locked into that idea, but it has developed greatly from that. I welcome that it will be much more than one big stadium; it will have indoor and outdoor facilities. There are many minority sports that have not been very well catered for in the past and whose facilities have been sadly lacking. Many of the people involved in those sports can look forward to having good facilities and not having to share facilities or use a facility for a half day once a year.</P>
    <P>Last night I heard a speaker going on about Croke Park, asking why we need a second stadium. That amused me, given that when the planning application was being considered for the development of Croke Park four, five or more years ago, it was a battle to get it through. There was a bit of a political divide and some people spoke against it. While thankfully the divide was not on purely party lines, many of the people who were against it are those asking why we need another stadium and can Croke Park not cater for soccer, rugby and every other sport.</P>
    <P>Events in Croke Park pose a problem for many people living in its vicinity. I accept there are many advantages in having a stadium in a city centre or in an area where there is lots of life, pubs and restaurants nearby. In an ideal world it would be great if a location in the docks area could be found for a stadium such as this, but people have to live in the shadow of places such as Croke Park and the holding of events there also causes problems for people in the wider area of Fairview, Marino, Drumcondra and Ballymun. Many of those people have to put up with an awful lot of grief from early May until end September, Sunday after Sunday, and now more often with matches on Saturdays and replays. It is not fair to tell those people that, from a national economic point of view, all sports should be played on that pitch, that there will be soccer matches in the autumn and rugby matches in the winter and they will have to suffer the hassle that is part of that weekend after weekend, particularly when that stadium is in the middle of a residential area, and I do not know if the pitch would stand up to that level of activity. Outside that, it would not be fair or proper to inflict any more on the people.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Gay Mitchell was Lord Mayor of Dublin he set up a body&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever. The body was to try to tap into sports tourism. I am a member of Dub<Col N="909" /> lin Tourism and tourism in the city is flying, having developed in many respects, but sports tourism is a major aspect of tourism in many cities. Deputy Mitchell was to the forefront in this when thinking of the ultimate goal, the Olympics, and there is no harm in any of us having a dream, even if it seems distant. He was very forward thinking because there are many events bigger than rugby and soccer internationals or All-Ireland finals, such as UEFA cup finals and the Rugby World Cup. Many events that could be exploited in sports tourism would not necessarily draw 80,000 people. Some years ago an over 40s rugby tournament in Dublin attracted 10,000 spectators.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell had the idea that we could develop a stadium and develop uses for it. He had a committee working on that which came up with very good projects. The Olympics might be far down the line but there are many other events such a stadium could cater for. Some of them might not even be sporting events, as the stadium could boost business, tourism and jobs also. I cannot understand the negativity and lack of vision coming from Fine Gael on this matter. Since the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation was set up my constituency has done very well and we hope the redevelopment of Ballymun gets the green light one of these days.</P>
      <P>It amazes me that we spend up to £5 billion per year on health and yet we do very little in health promotion. Anything to do with sport is health promotion. It may involve anything from the local under 11 team looking for jerseys to an event attended by 80,000 people. Everyone needs dreams. Though rugby players do not come from disadvantaged areas in Dublin, if one goes to such an area and asks a successful soccer or rugby player what gave him his original dream of involvement in sport, he will not say it happened when he was 11 on a wet Saturday morning in the Phoenix Park. It happens when he sees his father, cousin or school play a game. That is what sets a dream in motion. The huge stadium is linked to the under 11 team at grassroots level. It takes years of training and striving to get from one to the other and they are all part of the one dream and activity. It is ridiculous to think the top level can be supported without having a nursery and equally, one cannot have the nursery without the top level. No matter what business one is in, everyone wants to perform at the top level. Even in this Chamber every Member wants to be on the front bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very good idea. It will not just be a big stadium out in the wilderness but will be just beyond my constituency. It may be beyond the housing areas at present but it will bring activity and jobs to that area. People will not necessarily have to go back into the city centre for a pint or a meal; pubs, restaurants and other businesses will evolve in the area. I am totally behind this stadium. It is a good idea that should be pushed ahead so that existing fears about it fade away. It <Col N="910" /> will take a couple of years to do this but I support it fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with the Fine Gael policy on this matter, having spent five years from 1987 to 1992 as Minister of State with responsibility for sport. I tried hard to get a national stadium off the ground but at that time the problem was money. The need for an outdoor stadium, indoor and outdoor arenas and a swimming pool was urgent then and is much more urgent now. It would be short-sighted of us not to not take an opportunity to build a monument for the future when the economy is going well. It is crazy to suggest this money should be spent on sports clubs around the country. Money needs to be spent on such clubs but we also need a major facility in which the people can watch sport and in which major future sporting events can be held.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell announced a very good initiative to bring the Olympics to Ireland when he was Lord Mayor of Dublin but we could not contemplate doing so without this specific facility. We need one major outdoor facility which can accommodate 80,000 people. We will have that in Croke Park but it will not be able to accommodate everything. The pitch will not be able to handle all the rugby, soccer and GAA games and there will be no lights there, so we need a second stadium with the capacity for 80,000 people. We know that it is impossible to get tickets for any big game and that the only way an ordinary Joe soap can get a ticket is through luck.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that the soccer, rugby and GAA organisations get together and support this project. I do not understand the FAI's attitude. It is being handed a state of the art football stadium, the finest in the world, for little or nothing but it still wants to proceed with a half-baked plan to build a 45,000 seater stadium. We know that 45,000 is insufficient capacity for a major international. The real tragedy of the FAI's approach is that a small club on the west side of Galway which looks after children on the street has had a major struggle to stay alive for the past few years. It cannot pay referees or transport costs yet those at the top of the FAI say they can spend £165 million and tell the Government to go to hell. That makes no sense and I appeal to the FAI to abandon this idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>How about giving them sufficient finance to build it properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect Deputy Enright but two stadia are not needed for soccer. One major stadium is needed which can contain 80,000 people for four or five soccer games per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will command the same number of people for three rugby internationals. That is eight games, which is as many as there will be. There is no need for a second soccer stadium to accommodate that number. I am sure small stadia for club football could be accommodated and I <Col N="911" /> appeal to the FAI to take up the offer. Sports organisations in most countries would grab an offer by the Government of a state of the art stadium at a cost of £230 million. I do not understand why the FAI will not accept the offer.</P>
    <P>This opportunity will not come again. There was a proposal in 1991 to build an indoor arena that would hold 15,000 people. A site was acquired in the docklands and five consortia agreed to tender for the project. Unfortunately, the Department of Finance decided in its wisdom at the time that the State could not afford it. It would have cost a total of £36 million and it would have been partly financed by the private sector. We could have had a state of the art indoor facility for that amount ten years ago, but we did not have the foresight to proceed. We will be in the same position in ten years if the national stadium does not go ahead now. It will cost double the amount to build then if we decide to abandon it now.</P>
    <P>It is the right project and the Taoiseach and the private sector have shown great support for it and leadership with regard to it. I urge the Fine Gael Party to forget about this motion which does not make sense. The stadium must go ahead and it will happen. It will be a great monument to the politicians of this era who had the foresight to put it in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Crawford, Stanton, Ring, Reynolds and Enright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in principle with a national stadium or a national sports campus. There are good examples in other parts of the world where national stadia have worked well and sports campuses have promoted sporting excellence. Sydney is a good example of how sporting excellence can be promoted. The results in the swimming pool during the recent Olympics is a good indication in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, my main concern is that the Government's priorities are wrong. I do not accept that enough money is being spent on sporting clubs, community associations and recreational facilities around the country. In my constituency, every second sporting club has obvious problems. The town of Carrigaline has grown very quickly; there are similar towns throughout the country where up to 300 houses are being built each year. However, no sporting facilities are being put in place for these housing developments. Some 400 boys who are members of a soccer club in Carrigaline must practise and train each Saturday afternoon on a lawn that is not much bigger than the centre of the Chamber. Members of a rugby club in Carrigaline must get changed before matches in the golf club. The team plays on <Col N="912" /> ground leased temporarily from the county council and it is currently in danger of being evicted.</P>
    <P>A soccer club in the area is desperately attempting to fundraise for a clubhouse that will cost up to £300,000. It received a relatively small donation from the national lottery for the project, but it has no hope of raising the remaining funds in the short to medium term. However, at the same time, the Government wants to spend £700 million on a national stadium in Dublin although Croke Park will seat 80,000 people and Lansdowne Road can seat 50,000. If Eircom Park goes ahead, it will seat another 40,000 people.</P>
    <P>I consider Deputy Noel Ahern a reasonable person, but he appeared puzzled by our objection to the proposal. I do not object to a national stadium in principle, but I object to it being a priority when massive funding needs to be put into local sporting clubs and infrastructure. In many cases young people must get changed on the sides of soccer, rugby and GAA pitches. Until proper infrastructure has been provided throughout the country, the spending of a massive amount of money on another stadium in Dublin, which is not needed, cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy is present. Sport is most important in terms of ensuring people avoid the temptation of drugs and particularly alcohol. Areas such as Carrigaline &ndash; I could mention another 12 places &ndash; do not have the recreational and sporting infrastructure to enable people make use of their time outside school and home hours. Unfortunately, they become distracted and bored and they are led astray.</P>
    <P>The motion is about priorities. My problem is the Government's priority of building a national stadium before proper sporting infrastructure is put in place throughout the country. One of the speakers on the Government side mentioned preparation for the Olympics and a place in sporting excellence. I agree that a sports campus that promotes sporting excellence should be established. However, it will be a waste of time unless there are facilities throughout the country that can feed into that campus. Any other country that has developed a national campus or stadium has a sporting infrastructure that is significantly better than the infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for sharing his time and giving me an opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I am worried by the Minister's statement that the stadium would be a monument. I always feared the stadium was being developed as a monument to the Taoiseach and that his name would be the most important aspect of it. That is not what this matter should be about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, the main issue is <Col N="913" /> to ensure proper funding is made available to clubs at ground level and that they are not ignored at the expense of a national stadium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister inferred that there is no scarcity of money. If that is the case, will he deal with the fact that a facility in Monaghan town is closed? This is in addition to the fact that the local hospital is being downgraded, although that is not the Minister's responsibility &ndash; it is part of another Minister's portfolio. However, I am sure the Minister is aware through representations from his friend and electoral colleague in Monaghan, Councillor Robert Gallagher, that the swimming pool is closed. It is serious matter. This pool was built 25 years ago. Although £250,000 has been spent on the pool in recent years, a piece of the roof fell into it recently and it has been closed.</P>
      <P>The pool is used by the public and two clubs in particular, both of which are involved in competitions. It has serious implications for them. It means that these groups will have to travel long distances, in most cases to Northern Ireland, to carry out their training. What we need is a proper sports complex with a swimming pool. We need proper swimming facilities for both young and old. We need a gym, sauna, coffee shop and sports hall with all the necessary facilities because in this day and age the problem is that many young people have so much time to spare. If they do not have the proper facilities to use up some of their energies in this type of competitive sport, then they can easily get involved in other issues, which the Minister and I, living in the Border area, know too much about. There is a great need to replace this pool as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The pool is also used for teaching swimming and training people in water safety. Only a few weeks ago two of our brightest young people were lost in a tragedy and this shows the need to train as many people as possible in water safety. The Minister will receive a proposal soon and I hope that he will act on it, regardless of his plans for the stadium, because Monaghan town needs it badly.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for recent allocations to two clubs in Aghabog, which is an isolated parish. He gave £20,000 to one and £25,000 to another. That is helpful, but we need a great deal more. In a few months those clubs raised £75,000 and £58,000, respectively. We as a nation should be matching the sums raised locally rather than just giving such allocations. The sums involved were acceptable but we should be able to do better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the motion. Like my colleague, Deputy Coveney, I do not have a major problem in principle with building a national stadium. We should do all we <Col N="914" /> can to encourage sport and recreational activities among people of all ages. However, as Deputy Coveney stated, this motion is about prioritising.</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister yesterday and he was kind enough to reply to me. I was curious to know how many applications were received last year under the sports capital programme, how many were accepted and how many were not successful. I was told that 1,645 applications were received, 679 of which were successful. Some 966 of the applications were unsuccessful and there are all kinds of reasons for this, but 966 groups or individuals &ndash; most would have been groups &ndash; went to the trouble to put forward applications to the Department. That is a huge number. I wonder how many of those applications were unsuccessful due to lack of funds. Perhaps the Minister would let us know this at some future date. I might even ask him that by way of another parliamentary question. I know from talking to people in different parts of the country that the reason they were refused in many cases was that the application was not technically correct for one reason or another, for example, the &ldquo;i&rdquo; was not dotted or the &ldquo;t&rdquo; was not crossed. I ask the Minister to ensure if the money is available for these projects, as he seems to imply, and there is no shortage of money, that he would bend over backwards to facilitate clubs making applications. The information available to me is that spurious reasons, which are often of a technical nature, are given for not making the money available and putting it on the long finger. The Minister is shaking his head but I can provide examples of that.</P>
      <P>I also noted from a reply to a parliamentary question that 51 proposals for the construction of swimming pools were received last year and all but three are being processed; I welcome that development. That number was received last year and I do not know how many were received in other years but I am sure that information is available. That involves the expenditure of a colossal amount of money and it shows a huge need in local communities.</P>
      <P>We need to start encouraging children to take part in sports such as running and swimming at the earliest possible age. To achieve that, they must take part at a local level. We should put in place an infrastructure at local level first and encourage the great athletes to come from there. Let us put the national stadium and campus together then and not do it the other way round. My concern is that we would build a national campus and stadium and still not have a proper infrastructure at local level. That infrastructure should be put in place first before we do anything else. This is the point of divergence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague also spoke about the issue of drugs and alcohol. I know the Minister and everybody in the House shares his view. There are few recreational facilities available to young people <Col N="915" /> and there is very little for them to do other than go to pubs. If the Minister were to go into any of the major cities at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning, he will see the young people coming out of the night clubs because there are no youth clubs or facilities in many cases. This is another issue. We are debating the Youth Work Bill, 2000, and this is another area into which we must put massive resources. I am worried that Stadium and Campus Ireland will soak up such huge amounts of money that we will not have the money for ordinary young children around the country who need the assistance and help which we should be giving at national level. There is no swimming pool in Youghal, for instance, and the children must be brought by bus to Dungarvan, Fermoy and other places to avail of swimming lessons. That is not good enough in this day and age. There is a fantastic proposal on the Minister's desk. I hope he will look at it, expedite it as quickly as possible and give the UDC the go-ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows about the application in Cobh. I ask him to give it the go-ahead and expedite it as quickly as possible. It is almost four years waiting for it&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider the motion before the House. Why proceed with Campus Ireland at present when in Dublin we have in Croke Park as fine a pitch and stadium as one would see anywhere in the world? Croke Park will hold roughly 80,000 people and I believe that the GAA may be able to expand it.</P>
      <P>Lansdowne Road is a particularly fine pitch. The IRFU has spent a good deal of money on it and needs to spend a great deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>They say it is not big enough. It is their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>They say that but I believe it could be expanded with proper development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave £20 million to the development of Croke Park when he was Minister for Finance and I welcomed that allocation at the time. They are doing a tremendous job. On television the other night I saw Michaél Ó Muircheartaigh in <Col N="916" /> Croke Park and the empty stadium looked magnificent. The GAA really needs more money to develop it because it has had to borrow heavily for it. It is costing a great deal and it would be wonderful if the GAA received further assistance from the Government to help in its development rather than have the GAA enter into heavy debt commitments which will cause problems for the organisation's volunteers throughout the country who assist in the day to day running of Croke Park.</P>
    <P>The proposal of the FAI for Eircom Park should be carefully considered. I take great exception to what the Government is doing in relation to Eircom Park. What is happening is not fair. The FAI is to be congratulated on its efforts to date in planning to build a soccer stadium. The Government should have come forward with generous financial assistance to help build Eircom Park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I must correct that. The Government is in no way undermining anyone in the FAI. We continue to encourage the FAI and, as I said before, the FAI is welcome to go ahead with its development and is also welcome to come in to Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Five minutes ago in this House, Deputy O'Shea was here at the time, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Fahey, was asking the FAI to reconsider the whole position. That appears to be detrimental to the FAI. It has problems trying to develop it. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, may have one brief on it but other members of the Government have a different brief. It is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the FAI is trying to do is of immense importance and it is quite clear that the Government should encourage rather than discourage it. The Government prides itself on private enterprise and initiative and encourages people to build and it has a great interest in the development of the country. The FAI is a group of people, the vast majority of whom work voluntarily, which is building its own stadium for soc<Col N="917" /> cer. It should be further encouraged and the Government should come forward.</P>
    <P>I am interested that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation said he was prepared to fund Eircom Park and give financial assistance to it. I ask him to meet the chairman and treasurers to see if the Government can assist in the development of Eircom Park. It would be a wonderful situation if he did.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not making a false accusation in saying the Government is against Eircom Park. I hope I am wrong. However, judging by what is happening in the public press and on television and radio, it appears as if the Government is discouraging such efforts. I would be delighted if the Minister could meet the people in Eircom Park and discuss it with them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the IRFU, the Minister mentioned that the £50,000 is not sufficient. There is a great interest and revitalisation in rugby. Again, however, I am not certain what number the IRFU wish to accommodate at matches. <i>Stade de France</i>, a magnificent stadium, is losing quite a substantial amount of money each year. The Minister is in a better position to know but my information is that <i>Stade de France</i> is losing a significant amount of money and is a magnificent stadium in a huge city.</P>
    <P>What I encourage, and it is part of the motion, is that the Minister would enter negotiations with the IRFU regarding funding for a stadium development.</P>
    <P>Regarding the community games, as the Minister is aware, Mosney has been the venue for the community games finals consistently over the years. I am sure the Minister has been there himself and would join me in congratulating the work and efforts of the people involved. They are doing a splendid job and the community games are proceeding this year. They are being held in Mosney.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has had discussions with Mr. George O'Toole, the president of the community games, and with Mr. Brian MacManus, the chairman, to offer assistance to them. Is it possible for the Government to enter negotiations with the owners of Mosney to see if it can be developed in the long-term as a headquarters for the community games? It is something that would be of interest to the people attached to the community games.</P>

      <P>The facilities around Mosney, where they have been accommodated, are splendid. The accommodation is reasonably priced and <Col N="918" /> the people who attend each year are school-goers and young people, ranging in age from eight to 17 years. They can get reasonable accommodation around the Mosney area and at the complex.</P>
      <P>As I had a son and a daughter there at different times I am, therefore, aware of the situation and cost was nil or very little, whereas, if they come to Dublin, to, say, Campus Ireland, it will entail additional financial cost for many of these people.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister believe that I have a good rapport with the people in the community games and that all the people who have been there love to go to Mosney?</P>
      <P>In regard to the GAA, the Minister's county, Donegal, won the All-Ireland football championship in 1992. I congratulate the Minister on it. However, remember that people playing hurling and football in Offaly, if they get to an All-Ireland series, do not want to play in Campus Ireland. They want to play hurling and football in Croke Park.</P>
      <P>They might only get there once in a lifetime, for a quarter-final or a semi-final, but most young children across Offaly would give anything to play hurling or football in Croke Park in an All-Ireland but not in Campus Ireland. The Minister's plan to have part of the All-Ireland hurling and football series played in Campus Ireland is a mistake.</P>
      <P>The third part of the motion details the redirection of the money to be spent on a national stadium to the development of a sporting infrastructure at regional, club, schools and community levels. That is very important. Regarding most country towns, there are leisure centres in the larger hotels. Leisure centres are, however, expensive for the ordinary punter to use.</P>
      <P>We have two leisure centres in Tullamore and an excellent one in Portlaoise. The rest of the towns around Offaly, however, have no leisure centres. It is important that, whatever moneys are available, the Minister would examine the possibility of leisure centres provided by the State for people of all age groups. There is so little to do in many country towns and it is important that the Minister study how he can assist in their development. I ask him to consider the possibility of a public private partnership in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put substantial effort into the matter of swimming pools. I have been in communication with his office and have received his letters regarding Birr, Clara, Edenderry and Tullamore. Laois is the most inland county in the country, Offaly is next and they are, therefore, a long distance from the sea. I ask the Minister to <Col N="919" /> do everything possible to provide moneys for swimming pools in Birr, Clara and Edenderry.</P>
    <P>Again, the people running those pools are volunteers and it is great to see the amount of voluntary work they are putting in. It is wonderful to see their efforts and they need the Minister's support. I ask him to do what he can to expedite funding for the provision of upgrading these pools.</P>
    <P>The council has been in touch with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister has queried some of the proposals but I ask him to take a personal interest in the issue with the council to assist in developing these particular pools and to having the refurbishment work carried out. As a substantial amount of funding is now available given that Exchequer returns are excellent, the Minister might consider building new pools. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was a Minister for a period between 1970 and 1971 and I recollect that he opened a good number of swimming pools, as did the late James Tully. There has not been much progress since. We would be interested if it were possible to obtain new swimming pools as distinct from refurbishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider the matter. I would like to talk to him further about it at a future date.</P>
      <P>A great deal of money is needed for sports clubs. While the Minister has been quite generous to date through lottery funding and through his Department, nonetheless, rather than spending £1 billion on Sports Campus Ireland, it would be much better if money was allocated to specific areas, such as hurling, football, soccer and athletics clubs and so on. Those areas are of immense importance but the same can be said for many other sporting disciplines, such as tennis, hockey and so on. Many clubs need financial assistance and perhaps the Minister would consider that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who read the contributions of Opposition Members during the debate on the motion last night could be forgiven for believing that Ireland is a Third World country when it comes to the provision of sporting facilities. Equally their attitude to the development of Sports Campus Ireland shows they lack a vision for sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment of the Government, especially the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to providing the best for sport in terms of facility provision for participation and competition at local, regional and national level is there for all to see, not in <Col N="920" /> glossy brochures but in bricks and mortar. Throughout the country community and voluntary organisations have been supported through the sports capital programme and grants have been awarded in more than 1,300 projects towards the provision of facilities. These facilities are provided at local and regional level and it is a logical sequence that we now move to provide a national stadium in which all the people will take pride and which will put Dublin and Ireland on the map as having a facility in which European and world events can be staged.</P>
    <P>Did people see what happened in Australia? Had the Australians not had a vision for a major complex, they would not have had the wonderful events they had late last year. No one can argue that it did not put Australia on the map. They did themselves proud and it was a wonderful event not only for Australians but also for the world. Sports Campus Ireland can be put in place without doing any damage to the investment needed to continue with the programmes which provide funding for sports facilities, including swimming pools, at local level.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for the national drugs strategy and for the local development programme I cannot let the accusation that the provision of Sports Campus Ireland necessitates the redirection of resources from disadvantaged communities in need of sporting facilities to go unchallenged. That accusation is completely unfounded.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the benefits which are gained by young people through their involvement in sport and recreation. Involvement in such activities helps to form good sound character and acts as an antidote to anti-social behaviour. Under the young people services and facilities fund £30 million has already been committed to areas of most disadvantage with a further commitment of over £70 million during the lifetime of the national development plan. A substantial proportion of this money is being spent on providing sports facilities to young people at risk.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last night to the recent RTE programme which highlighted the St. Teresa's Gardens complex. At this stage everyone who knows the area, especially the residents, realises the picture depicted in that programme is not the full story or anything like it. The Government, through a series of initiatives, has targeted this area for special programmes and facilities which are generously funded. Among these are a grant of £450,000 towards the cost of refurbishing an existing hall in the complex, the complete refurbishment of Donore Avenue Boxing Club and the refurbishing of St. Teresa's Gardens AFC premises to which a grant of £15,000 was allocated. Many of the programmes are aimed at young people. In addition, funding has been provided towards the employment of youth workers to ensure that young people are guided into gain<Col N="921" /> ful use of their leisure time. I outline these initiatives as evidence of the Government's commitment to social disadvantage and for the information of Members who used the recent television programme in support of their opposition to the development of Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure the stadium will be fully accessible in every way and that families will not be priced out. I want the House to know that Sports Campus Ireland can and will be provided and many of the critics of the proposed development will take great pride when the facility becomes a reality.</P>

The Government realises that fact now and it is an embarrassment to it. It should accept the Opposition view that a much more sensible way to approach funding for sports capital within the economy is to assist small groups and organisations throughout the country which want to put basic infrastructure in place.</P>

      <P>Is it any wonder that my colleague polled 22% of the vote in County Mayo? I have always supported the idea of a national stadium but the Government has made a major mistake. Money is being provided for a national stadium which will not be everything it should be. It was the view in the centenary year of the GAA that every club should have a football pitch. This placed a massive strain on club funds. While each club now has its own pitch, in many instances they cannot be used for training during the winter. In Italy, the home of one of the major soccer leagues in the world, stadiums are shared. That was where I was coming from in regard to a national stadium.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed is ill-fated and ill-conceived. The development of Croke Park, the FAI project and, probably, Lansdowne Road should be looked at. When this matter was debated at the joint committee the Government was of the opinion that the national stadium would have a retractable roof, an athletics track and cater for all sports, including football, but that is not going to happen. It is, therefore, ill-conceived and ill-timed to spend a horrendous amount of money on a stadium which will not cater for all sectors of the sporting world. The Government should, as a consequence, retract its proposal.</P>

      <P>I have just come from a meeting where the atmosphere is much calmer than this one. Last night I raised six major and important questions regarding the cost of the national stadium. Because of the nature of politics, I presume the issues raised did not receive much coverage. Two years ago the Taoiseach mentioned a figure <Col N="926" /> of £280 million, which has since been increased to £550 million. In October he could not make up his mind in the Dáil about whether the figure was £230 million, £280 million or £550 million. The reality is that the national stadium will cost £1 billion and more to build. I assumed the Minister or the Minister of State would give us the answers to these six major and important questions.</P>

The conditions in this country would have been appropriate in the 19th century but the Taoiseach, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Government are pursuing their obsession with professional and spectator sports.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman's report was published yesterday but I did not have an opportunity to read it due to the pressing events of the past two days. There was a great deal of concern last summer following the publication of stories in the media which revealed that health boards were taking money from elderly people and their families for subventions. It now appears that these moneys will have to be returned by the health boards. I hope the Minister and Minister of State will tackle the health boards and ensure that whatever funding should be returned to these families will be returned. I also hope the Minister and his Department will rap the knuckles of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is also responsible for the special housing aid for the elderly scheme which is operated by the health boards. In my constituency, the health board is frightening old people by demanding money from them for this scheme. I have written to the Ombudsman and asked him to investigate this scheme as well. It is wrong that people of 65 years and more should have to make contributions to the health board. Sometimes when they are asked <Col N="928" /> for the contribution they do not actually know what works will be carried out or how much money in total they will have to pay. This practice does not occur in every health board. I put down parliamentary questions on this subject today and, according to the replies, some health boards have abolished it. I call on the Minister to ensure that the health boards who continue it are stopped.</P>
    <P>A constituent called to my clinic to discuss the subvention issue. He was most disturbed about it. He was not well off and his brothers and sisters in America were obliged to make a contribution towards the subventions for his mother when she was in the nursing home. At that time, the health board inquired about every member of the family, no matter how many there were or where in the world they lived. Each member was obliged to send a statement of their income. That was outrageous. Some family members took on the responsibility of looking after their elderly relatives but other members had their own families to support and mortgages to pay.</P>
    <P>I wish to ensure that moneys are returned to the people who were obliged to pay subventions at the request of the health boards. I also ask the Minister, with regard to the housing aid for the elderly scheme, to stop the practice of health boards taking money from the elderly. I have raised this issue on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I did not get an opportunity to read the Ombudsman's report. There is terrible abuse of the elderly in this country. Up to 12,000 elderly people suffer abuse at the hands of their carers and other people, according to a report drawn up by the national council on ageing and older people. Every day there are court cases which show how elderly people are treated. I have previously called on the Minister to establish a help line for the elderly. Since I raised this matter and the media gave it coverage, I have received phone calls from people throughout the country describing their problems and the abuse they suffer. Abuse can take many forms.</P>
    <P>I will return to this topic on another occasion. I now have to return to other pressing business. I hope the Minister of State will give the health boards a slap. I do not often agree with comments made by the Minister and the Taoiseach but on this occasion I do. The Civil Service, the health boards and councils have gone too far. They seem to think that because they work for the State their word is law. Thank God for the Ombudsman. I hope when legislation relating to the Ombudsman comes before the House again he will be given further powers and more resources. He will then be able to take on the health boards and the councils. The only time one can put manners on health boards or councils is when one threatens to refer a case to the Ombudsman. However, his powers are restricted. I hope he will be given more power and resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> I compliment the Ombudsman on this report. The Minister must take on the health boards and the officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the issues raised in the report into the nursing home subventions published yesterday by the office of the Ombudsman. This is a detailed report, representing a considered analysis of significant issues of public policy, public management and the practice of good government.</P>
      <P>While the report analyses in detail the operation of one scheme, the nursing home subvention scheme, its conclusions dwell on the more fundamental reforms considered desirable by the Ombudsman in how Government operates in the Irish context, particularly in relation to the balance between the roles of the Executive and the Legislature. The far reaching conclusions outlined in chapter eight of the report will justify careful consideration in all relevant quarters and particularly at political and senior public service levels.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children and the health boards are criticised in the report for their handling of the nursing home subvention scheme. A number of significant shortcomings in the operation of the scheme have been highlighted and the findings in the Ombudsman's final report will be fully considered by the Department.</P>
      <P>An expenditure review of the scheme is currently being undertaken by the Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the findings of the review, the report of the Ombudsman and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. I outlined in my replies to parliamentary questions yesterday a number of immediate steps being taken to remedy shortcomings in the scheme. It might be helpful if I highlighted these again this evening.</P>
      <P>The immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. The first of these relates to the payment of refunds to subvention recipients or their families arising from the application of Article 8.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993. This allows health boards to disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the operation of Article 8.2, an additional allocation of £4 million was made available in 1998 in letters of determination to six <Col N="930" /> of the eight health boards where the regulations had been applied incorrectly to meet the cost of arrears payments under Article 8.2 in addition to other expenditure under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting with the Office of the Ombudsman in December 1999, the Department became aware of continuing delays in paying arrears. The Department took up this issue with the boards concerned and is continuing to pursue the matter. The current position is that where arrears were due to be paid, health boards have made retrospective payments in respect of persons currently resident in nursing homes. Some boards have also paid arrears in respect of former subvention recipients now deceased and former recipients who are no longer resident in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>To date, approximately £900,000 has been paid in respect of Article 8.2 arrears. I assure Deputies that every effort will be made to pay all outstanding arrears as soon as possible and I have instructed my Department to pursue this with the health boards concerned.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the manner in which the £4 million allocation in 1998 was used by the health boards. As I indicated earlier, this allocation was not intended to be used solely for the payment of Article 8.2 arrears. The Department has been informed by the health boards concerned that the funding provided was used to cover arrears payments under the article; additional expenditure arising as a result of the easing of family circumstances regulations in 1996; the payment of enhanced subventions; expenditure shortfalls arising from the increased demands under the scheme and legal and other costs associated with the administration of the scheme. A proportion of the allocation was used by three of the health boards to fund other services for older people, namely, the provision of aids and appliances &ndash; primarily incontinence wear, improved home help services and the opening of a unit for the elderly mentally infirm. While this money was not expended on the subvention scheme, it was used for the benefit of older people.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to make appropriate payments in respect of nursing home patients and their families who may have been affected by the family circumstances regulations prior to their amendment in 1999. This amendment removed the provision which allowed health boards to assess the capacity of adult sons and daughters over 21 years of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care for their parents. A group representing the Department and the health boards-ERHA has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis. This will be a complex exercise involving difficult issues of traceability and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible. I should add that the legal advice <Col N="931" /> available to me is that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. However, in the interests of fairness to the people concerned, the Minister and I decided on this course of action. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>My immediate priority is to remedy shortcomings identified in the report which impact on people in nursing homes and their families. The steps which I have outlined to the House in regard to the calculation and making of payments by the health boards will, I hope, reassure Deputies that this matter is being given the highest priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. All Members of the House will be anxious to indicate their sympathy for the Indian people who have suffered so greatly. Estimates of fatalities range from an initial estimate of 100,000 to lesser figures but nobody is certain of the final number. We should all be proud and supportive of the efforts of such organisations as Trócaire, Concern, GOAL and the Red Cross. I welcome the Irish Government's response, in approving £1 million in aid, to the Indian earthquake relief fund.</P>
      <P>When the rescue teams leave, the huge task of looking after more than 300,000 people over the next four months will remain. It is important that logistical, technical and other support is provided to address such issues as the creation of the capacity to provide clean water, housing and other basic infrastructure. The total damage to this poor region has been estimated in the region of between $5 billion and $6 billion. Ireland's position on the Security Council enables us to advance further proposals at this stage which will be of assistance in the future. A rapid reaction force should be established to respond to natural disasters. It is also possible to anticipate many disasters such as earthquakes and a case can be made for assembling a better international logistical framework which would predict, prevent or respond to crises such as the recent one in India.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal from one of the organisations involved in the provision of relief in India suggests that £35 would provide blankets for 12 children or water purification tablets for 100 families. A sum of £100 would provide six households with the wherewithal to rebuild their lives and £1,000 would provide shelter for 100 families. When we compare these figures to the amount of money spent on the production of armaments, a huge moral question is posed: if such small sums could make such a huge difference in response to a crisis, is it not time the international community <Col N="932" /> invested greater technical and scientific intelligence in the provision of advice to people living along earthquake belts and in other areas of risk? While many of the rescue teams arrived in India very quickly, there is an unfortunate delay in the delivery of assistance. We, in Ireland, are fortunate in having agencies which regularly represent the spirit of Ireland abroad in response to emergencies such as the one in India.</P>
    <P>It is obscene that so much of the world's scientific and technological intelligence is wasted on armaments when a tiny proportion, if deflected to the task of predicting disasters and developing intervention and response mechanisms, would make a huge difference to our common humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I am replying to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for overseas development and human rights, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Irish people were particularly shocked by the earthquake in India on the morning of Friday, 26 January which was India's Republic Day. I take this opportunity to reiterate our condolences and sympathy to the Indian Government and people as they seek to rebuild their lives and livelihoods in the aftermath of this appalling disaster.</P>
      <P>The epicentre of the earthquake, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale, was close to Bhuj city in the state of Gujarat and caused enormous damage in terms of human life and injury. Reported to be the strongest earthquake disaster in India for more than 40 years, this event is set to have a negative impact on regional and national infrastructures well beyond the initial emergency response phase. While just over 6,444 fatalities have been officially confirmed, the local authorities in Gujarat estimate that the final death toll will be somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000. Similarly, the number of people injured in Gujarat is officially 16,767, but final figures are expected to exceed this figure. Those displaced by the earthquake according to some sources represent a total of 100,000 people, although this figure will have to be reconciled with ongoing assessments of the situation.</P>
      <P>The Irish Embassy in New Delhi is monitoring the situation closely. The embassy is not aware of any Irish citizens living in the region of the disaster. Two Irish tourists who were travelling in the area of the earthquake have been reported safe. The embassy is in regular contact with my Department in relation to ongoing developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising the magnitude of this disaster, the Irish Government took early action to support the immediate emergency response and to provide immediate emergency relief for the suffering population. On Saturday, 27 January we <Col N="933" /> announced bilateral emergency assistance of up to £1 million in response to this devastating earthquake. As highlighted at that time, the toll of death, injury and destruction continues to rise by the hour and it has been especially important to rapidly support the efforts of the Indian authorities, international agencies and organisations already active and operational on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Indian authorities have established a disaster management group and a number of international disaster assessment and management teams are now active in the field. There is continued urgency in meeting the basic needs of shelter, food and clothing in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and to give early attention to shocked survivors, many of whom remain in remote areas. Co-ordination of the relief effort will be a key element in maximising field effectiveness in the light of the scale and impact of the disaster.</P>
    <P>To expedite the impact of Ireland's bilateral emergency response, an initial amount of £250,000 has been made immediately available to the International Federation of the Red Cross which is co-ordinating with the Indian authorities in their response to the emergency. The remaining Ireland Aid funds will be made available by way of immediate responses to emerging needs. The United Nations Children's Fund has committed US$8 million in immediate assistance to the State of Gujarat while the European Community Humanitarian Affairs Office has similarly committed up to 3 million as an initial immediate contribution. The World Bank has pledged to immediately release US$300 million.</P>
    <P>A number of national and international NGOs have already signalled their intention to submit early emergency funding proposals to Ireland Aid and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who has special responsibility in this area, will be discussing the ongoing crisis and appropriate responses with them this week. Like the UN and the EU, these organisations have sent experts to the disaster area in order to assess immediate needs and to determine the most effective responses.</P>
    <P>I reiterate our sympathy with the people of India in their endeavour to recover from this fatal and debilitating disaster. I do this in a spirit of bilateral friendship and anticipation that the Irish Government and people will wish to continue to help their Indian counterparts in recovering from the crisis and in the reconstruction of their lives and livelihoods. I undertake to convey the views and suggestions articulated by the Deputy to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter. A principal officer <Col N="934" /> in the Department of Health and Children announced on behalf of the Minister a new initiative on 29 November 2000 concerning funding for specialist nursing courses. Under the initiative a nurse or midwife undertaking certain specialist courses should receive full pay while doing so. The announcement stated that &ldquo;he or she will also be entitled to have his or her fees paid in full for this course&rdquo;. This is in return for a commitment on the part of the nurse or midwife to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area for one year following completion of the course.</P>
      <P>I received a letter from a nurse which states:</P>
      <P>I am currently undertaking a higher diploma in orthopaedic nursing in Cappagh Hospital, Finglas, which is affiliated to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. This course is of 15 months duration and involves working on a full-time basis as a regional general nurse on orthopaedic wards while simultaneously attending college. This course is subject to a fee of £1,600 and a reduction in salary to the first point on the staff nursing scale.</P>
      <P>Because the individual wants to do the course and improve her eligibility, she will have a loss of earnings of £8,000 while attending the course. She recently became aware of the circular relating to the announcement made by the Department. I agree with her that the decision taken clearly lacks equality at a time when everybody should be treated the same.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to rectify this situation. Over the years I have met a number of nurses who had serious difficulty in getting off work to do courses such as this to improve their ability in specialist care. Given the money available and the fact that there are not thousands doing such courses, a person should not be asked to pay a fee and work at the same time and take a drop in their pay scale. In fairness, as the nurse who wrote the letter said, equality should be the order of the day.</P>
      <P>The Minister likes to ensure people get fair play and in my dealings with him on committees he has ensured this over recent years. I ask him to consider what I am suggesting and to take these people into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Farrelly for raising this issue. On 29 November last I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service and addressing shortages in specialist areas. As part of the initiative I made funding available for nursing courses in specified specialised areas of clinical practice in order to address the critical shortage of nurses in those areas. In particular, I provided funding for the establishment of new courses in hospitals outside Dublin, including the Cork hospitals and Water<Col N="935" /> ford and Limerick regional hospitals. This is being done in order to arrest the drift of specialist nurses from the acute Dublin hospitals. The availability of new programmes in hospitals around the country will free up places in the Dublin hospitals which can be allocated to Dublin based nurses.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative nurses or midwives undertaking certain specialist courses will receive full pay while doing so. They will also be entitled to have their fees paid in full. This is in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses or midwives to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area for one year following completion of the course. These arrangements are effective from the current academic year and will apply to post-registration courses in the following areas of clinical practice: accident and emergency; critical care, including intensive care, coronary care and burns; and peri-operative, including peri-anaesthesia, operating theatre and operating department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the initiative does not cover all specialist courses and that nurses or midwives undertaking courses not included in this initiative often do so at their own expense. However, the areas included in the initiative have been identified as those where the shortage of specialist nurses is most acute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was for that reason that I decided to concentrate the resources available to me in the current year on those areas. Therefore, we were moving in particular areas where significant shortages were identified. However, I assure the Deputy I will continue to monitor the situation and that I will ask the Department to monitor the situation in the context of service needs. We will examine the situation raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will commend the progress made by me and the Department in supporting nurses and midwives generally. As part of my overall recruitment and retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses, at an annual cost of some £9 million: payment of fees to nurses and midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; an improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; an enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses and midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; and the abolition of fees for &ldquo;back to prac<Col N="936" /> tice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses and midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>This is in addition to the £8.5 million which was allocated to the health agencies for continuing nurse education between 1994 and 1999. Individual nurses and midwives who are not eligible for funding under the schemes announced by me may apply to their employers for funding from the separate continuing nurse education budget available to their employers. That is something that could be taken up by the nurse in question but on the point raised, I will have a look at it again in the context of future and interim need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment, and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>Just over two weeks ago, Iarnród Éireann assembled a battalion of heavy machinery, JCBs and trucks on Killiney beach to carry out what it has called emergency works to protect the railway line. Since then it has shipped in heavy rock by sea, dug and dredged Killiney beach and turned one of this city's greatest natural amenities into a building site.</P>
      <P>I have visited the beach on a number of occasions in the past two weeks, most recently on Sunday morning last, and I am appalled at the damage being caused to the beach and the foreshore. The people of Killiney and the surrounding areas in my constituency are bewildered and horrified that a State company with the apparent compliance of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources should inflict such violence on this most beautiful amenity.</P>
      <P>This work is being carried out without a foreshore licence from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, without consultation or advance information to the public and their elected representatives and without even a courtesy phone call to the Killiney Beach Awareness Group through whose voluntary efforts this beach is maintained, cleaned and protected, and through whose energies Killiney beach achieved its blue flag award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those works currently under way by Iarnród Éireann at Killiney beach are illegal. They have no foreshore licence. This is not an emergency. If it were a genuine emergency, Iarnród Éireann would not be running trains on a line which would require remedial works of such urgency that the procedures of the Foreshore Act have to be set aside. This is not an emergency because according to maps in my possession, those works were planned as far back as October and, according to reports which I have heard, the planning of this work goes back at least six months. I would like to compliment my colleague, Councillor Jane <Col N="937" /> Dillon Byrne, who was the first to raise this matter publicly.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann had ample time to submit an application for a foreshore licence or to submit in the normal way an application for a coastal protection scheme. In both scenarios, public consultation would and should have occurred and coastal protection expertise from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and from the Marine Institute could have been assembled to ensure that any necessary works would be carried out sensitively so as not to destroy a great natural amenity.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources a number of questions in relation to this development. Did his Department give approval to Iarnród Éireann to carry out this work? If it did, under what statute was such permission given because in my opinion there is no way around the Foreshore Act in a case like this? If permission was not given &ndash; I believe permission was not given &ndash; the most serious view must be taken of Iarnród Éireann's breach of the Foreshore Act. The Department should order an immediate halt of the work until a proper scheme is prepared and Iarnród Éireann should be prosecuted for carrying out beach works without a foreshore licence.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that anybody, least of all a State owned company, can effectively take over and rearrange a public amenity such as Killiney beach. It is not acceptable that Iarnród Éireann can take a short cut through the well established procedures of the Foreshore and Coastal Protection Acts and it is not acceptable that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources should stand aside and allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>My constituents, many of whom are meeting tonight in the Killiney Court Hotel, want answers and they want action. Above all, we want our beach back and we look to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, who is the custodian of our coastline, to protect Killiney beach which has been entrusted to his care and which is now in danger. I would like to hear from the Minister of State the action he intends to take to restore the damage that has been done and get back to the situation whereby Iarnród Éireann is complying with the normal procedures and the Foreshore Act in the normal way, and that whatever work is necessary to protect the railway line is carried out in a way that respects the amenity of Killiney beach, the interests and wishes of the local community and the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I want to make it clear at the outset that I am not impressed with what has happened on Killiney beach. I would also like to say that the reply the Deputy is now receiving had some changes made <Col N="938" /> to it before they could be made on his copy so I will be saying a little more than is included in that reply, but I want to make it clear that there was no intention to pull a fast one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department became aware of the fact that Iarnród Éireann was carrying out emergency works to protect the railway line at Killiney on Friday, 19 January and that in order to carry out such work it was depositing substantial quantities of rock on the beach at Killiney and that there was a substantial amount of earth-moving equipment on the beach. No application for a foreshore lease or licence had been received.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, 24 January Department officials, on my instruction, met consultants for Iarnród Éireann on the project and impressed upon them the need for a foreshore licence for such works. We believe the Department moved swiftly on the matter and engaged with Iarnród Éireann immediately in the interests of public safety and that works proceed with due care and attention to the public foreshore.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that there has been serious erosion to the cliff face at Killiney and that this erosion has endangered the safety of the railway line which runs along the cliff at this location. Emergency repairs carried out in the past are now subject to stress. Iarnród Éireann advises me that the position is such that if immediate works are not carried out, there would be a risk of a collapse of the railway line and should a train be passing at the time of such collapse, there would be inevitable loss of human life. I recall an incident which happened in Wexford when, unfortunately, a bridge was removed unintentionally, a train came down the tracks and five people lost their lives. However, I take into consideration the remarks of the Deputy that if the track is in such danger, why are the trains still running? The options open are the closure of the railway line pending the normal procedures and reinstatement of the line, the repair of the embankment on a temporary basis pending a long-term solution or the compulsory acquisition of property and the moving back of the rail line.</P>
      <P>The closure for a prolonged period of such a vital infrastructure as this line which, in addition to serving DART commuters, serves as a vital link with Rosslare, in my own constituency, IFI Industries in Arklow etc., cannot readily be contemplated. The compulsory acquisition of a property and the moving back of the railway line away from the coast is a slow process and the only realistic option is to carry out temporary works to make the railway safe. That prompts the question: why has this work not been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann advises me that the current temporary works involved the placing of rock <Col N="939" /> armour revetments at the base of the sea wall over a distance of about 300 metres. The rock armour will stretch about eight metres out towards the sea. The rock is transported by barge to the beach at high tide and recovered and moved up the beach at low tide. Cleaning and reinstatement of the beach will commence when this work is complete. Stone mattresses will be placed at the base of the embankment slope to protect the soil from over-topping of waves. These will be hand filled with stones and lifted into place by excavator. Iarnród Éireann has advised me that it is anticipated these emergency works will be completed by the second week of April. It has also advised me that development of a permanent solution is under way and that it will discuss the permanent solution with officials of my Department as work on its development progresses. I have not done so yet, but I will suggest to it that the local community should be con<Col N="940" /> sulted. The rock revetments used in the temporary solution will be removed when the permanent solution is in place. Iarnród Éireann has also advised that, prior to commencement of the permanent works, it will engage in consultation with the county council and the public generally.</P>
    <P>There is a number of legal issues arising from this matter which my Department is addressing in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office and the solicitor for Iarnród Éireann. Consequently, I cannot directly answer the Deputy's question, much as I would like to. My Department is being represented at senior level at the public meeting to which the Deputy referred. I take this opportunity to impress upon Iarnród Éireann that any moves it intends to make should only be made in consultation with me and my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The local development work of area based partnerships and ADM community groups continues to be supported with funding under the social inclusion and child-care sub-programme of the regional operational programmes. This funding amounts to £220 million over the life of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. A sum of £122 million has also been provided for the national drugs strategy under the sub-programme for this period.</P>
      <P>The new local development measure required that local action plans were drawn up by partnership companies and ADM community groups, in consultation with the director of community and enterprise of the relevant city and county development boards. These plans were submitted to ADM Limited by December 2000, and were evaluated by ADM's appraisal committees for the southern and eastern region, and for the Border, midlands and western region.</P>
      <P>In 2000 more than £16 million was drawn down under the new programme. Last year also saw the completion of work under the previous local development programme. The allocation of funding for the period 2000 to 2003 is now taking place. A sum of £34.5 million has been allocated to ADM for partnerships and community groups to implement their action plans in 2001. Allocations are subject to an annual review and the amounts allocated may be increased or decreased on the basis of each group's effectiveness in carrying out their plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> Under the drugs initiative, an amount of more £9 million has been drawn down under the NDP. This amount relates to expenditure under the existing local drugs task force plans. The task forces are currently finalising updated plans for assessment by the national drugs strategy team. No deadline was set for the submission of updated plans in order to give the task forces as much time as they needed to develop new strategies. However, to date, seven plans have been submitted with the remaining seven expected over the coming months. Draw down on the new plans should commence early in 2001 as plans are approved and projects are established.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation that Irish tourism's traditional core values of hospitality and friendliness are diminishing; the steps he will take to counter this trend, especially in relation to training of personnel working in the tourism sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2399/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that the extraordinary success of the Irish tourism industry in recent years could, perversely, lead to pressures on the quality of service on offer to the customer and a diminution in the traditional core values of hospitality and friendliness. In order to minimise this risk it is essential that industry strive to maintain its pool of highly motivated, productive and committed skilled labour to respond to market demand for quality service and value for money. It is my view that, to achieve this objective, the industry as a whole needs to further deepen its relationship with CERT, which is actively encouraging and promoting the development of training capacity and better human resource management skills.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated £107 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to CERT to help the tourism industry secure and retain a professional and skilled workforce to meet existing and emerging needs in the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of tourism product and service. In this context, over £16 million is being allocated to CERT in 2001 to facilitate the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2000-2006 which is designed to deliver the objectives set out in the NDP for raising and maintaining the highest operational and human resource standards in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For its part, CERT recognises the importance of customer care and the core values of friendliness and hospitality to the continued success of the Irish tourism industry. Accordingly, customer care modules form an integral part of all of CERT's elementary and craft level training programmes. CERT has also developed a number of <Col N="943" /> programmes as part of its Strategic Plan 2000-2006 to emphasise the importance of these core values. One of these is the Ireland's Best Programme, the objective of which is to keep customers happy and to improve internal relationships within the company, thus helping to increase motivation and staff retention rates. In recognition of the significant achievements of the companies which have been involved in this programme, CERT has decided to establish an Ireland's best award scheme. This scheme will result in successful businesses achieving a mark of distinction for service excellence.</P>
    <P>CERT's recently published report, Hospitality Best Practice &ndash;  A Benchmark Study, found that for the continued success and growth of the Irish tourism and hospitality industry to continue, it must aspire to international best practice to complement the traditional Irish friendliness and Ireland's unique environment. In response to these findings, CERT is planning a number of management development initiatives to assist in improving operational performance, and is also working with Excellence Ireland to develop a business excellence recognition scheme to promote the attainment of excellence within the industry and to provide a framework within which management and staff can work towards higher levels of performance.</P>
    <P>The recently published &ldquo;Employment Survey 2000&rdquo; indicates that despite skills shortages in the industry, more than 40% of companies plan further expansion in 2001. As the level of vacancies continues to rise, companies are now recruiting overseas in increasing numbers. To assist employers in managing the induction of overseas staff, CERT has developed a Fáilte Induction Pack which places great emphasis on customer care with a view to preserving the core values of hospitality and friendliness.</P>
    <P>The Irish tourism industry Confederation's &ldquo;People and Place Programme&rdquo;, which was launched by me in November 1999, was one of 22 projects financed by my Department under the Tourism and the Environment Pilot Initiative of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999. The programme was designed to encourage people involved in tourism to be more aware of the core values of Irish tourism &ndash; our friendly people and our scenic environment. I understand that backed by Bord Fáilte and the Irish tourism industry Confederation, a comprehensive training programme will be undertaken over the next two years, based on a nation-wide network of contacts representative of all sectors of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures, underpinned by the Government's allocation of £107 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will help the tourism industry to secure and retain a professional and skilled workforce to meet existing and emerging needs of the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of service, hospitality and friendliness to the customer.</P>

      <P>Britain is Ireland's most important market for tourism, representing 3.5 million visitors and approximately £900 million in revenue earnings in 2000. Based on latest CSO statistics, Bord Fáilte estimates that overall visitor numbers from Britain increased by 5% last year, with revenue earnings increasing by 13%.</P>
      <P>However, notwithstanding the above figures, there is evidence of emerging weakness in recent years in the British holiday market which is causing concern to both the industry and Bord Fáilte. It was for that reason that Bord Fáilte commissioned a major external consultancy review last year of the British market for holidays in Ireland. The review highlighted a number of issues within the market and put forward a series of recommendations to address the emerging challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This consultancy review has been considered <Col N="945" /> by the new tourism marketing partnership, which includes the industry and Bord Fáilte, and it has submitted a joint report to me which recommends a specific programme to address the strategic challenges in the British market, including a proposal for funding incremental marketing activities. This programme involves a combination of brand building with a tactical year round advertising campaign to reflect changing seasonality and holiday decision taking patterns. A shift in marketing direction is also envisaged, with greater emphasis on building customer relationship marketing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to point out that, in the recent budget, additional funding of £12.5 million was announced for tourism marketing in 2001, of which £5 million is designed to enhance the general tourism marketing effort, including addressing emerging challenges in the British market, furthering wider regional spread and supporting smaller tourism enterprises. The intention is that a substantial proportion of this £5 million will be directed towards the British market and I am awaiting specific proposals from Bord Fáilte, building on the recent work of the tourism marketing partnership. This is additional to general tourism marketing proposals for 2001 formulated by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the tourism marketing partnership and launched before Christmas.</P>

    <P>Arrangements over the last number of years between the proprietor of the Mosney holiday camp and the national community games organisation were a commercial matter for the two parties. Before Christmas, my colleague, the Minister <Col N="946" /> for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, met representatives of the national community games to discuss the possibility of accommodating this year's games at Mosney in the light of the proprietor's recent decision to enter into arrangements to provide accommodation for asylum seekers at the camp. Officials from my Department were also present.</P>
    <P>Arising from this meeting and subsequent efforts by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Directorate of Asylum Support Services, I am advised that it has been found possible to offer Mosney camp to the national community games as a venue for finals again this year. I am pleased to note that at the community games AGM held last weekend in Tullamore, the organisation decided to accept this offer and hold the games in Mosney in 2001.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government funding made available for the development of sport and the provision of sport and recreational facilities has risen to £117 million for 2001. Included in this provision is an amount of £65,376,000 for the development of Sports Campus Ireland at Abbotstown.</P>
      <P>Under the sports capital programme administered by my Department, applications for funding were invited by way of public advertisement on 15 and 17 December 2000 with the closing date for receipt of applications under the 2001 programme being 9 February 2001. Until all applications have been received and assessed, it will not be possible to state the value of applications and the level of grants to be allocated to projects under the 2001 programme. I intend to make allocations under this programme as soon as all applications received under the programme have been assessed in accordance with the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. An amount of £20 million is provided in the Estimates for expenditure in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has committed £45 million to the local authority swimming pool programme for the three year period, 2000-02, and there are 46 applications currently pending. There are four stages in a swimming pool project and grants are not allocated to a project until the third of these stages &ndash; when tenders have been received for the work proposed. Outstanding commitments under the programme currently amount to almost £7 <Col N="947" /> million and it is expected that further commitments will be made in the course of the year once tenders and project costs have been finalised in the case of each applicant.</P>
    <P>The construction of a 50 metre swimming pool at Limerick University is due for completion this year at a total capital cost to my Department's Vote of £5.9 million. The financial provision in the 2001 Estimates is in respect of the completion of the payment of the Department grant towards the project. A sum of £197,000 per annum has been allocated towards its operational costs to provide opportunities for our high performance swimmers to have access to the pool.</P>
    <P>Provision of £16,105,000 has been made in my Department's Estimates for the Irish Sports Council, which has been established on a statutory basis since 1 July 1999. The Government intends to double the annual budget of the Sports Council over the next four years to £20 million and, as a first step, an additional £2.5 million has been provided to the Sports Council in 2001. The council is responsible for the development of sport in all its many forms, including the provision of funding to sports and recreation organisations and high-performance individual sports persons.</P>

      <P>At the inaugural meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format, held in Belfast on 27 October 2000, the council agreed that the board of the new all-island tourism marketing company &ndash; Tourism Ireland Ltd. &ndash; would have 12 members.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 74 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Last summer I initiated a comprehensive review of the national drugs strategy to ensure that the policies and strategies being pursued at present remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground. The objective of the review is to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy and to develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new structures through which to deliver them. It is being overseen by a steering committee known as the review group which consists of representatives from relevant Government Departments, State agencies and the community and voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>Some 190 submissions were received from individuals and organisations in response to the public call for submissions. Due to the high level of public interest, I decided to also carry out a thorough and lengthy nationwide consultation process over the summer months and into autumn. Eight regional consultative fora were held around the country in which over 600 people took part. I subsequently invited over 30 agencies and organisations to make detailed presentations to further assist in identification of gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy.</P>
      <P>Since then, and with the assistance of external consultants, drafting of the report of the review has been progressing under the direction of the review group. It is hoped to have the report completed and ready for submission to Government in the coming month or so.</P>

      <P>Of the £12.5 million announced in the budget for additional tourism marketing expenditure by Bord Fáilte: £2.5 million will be used by the board to attract major sporting events with tourism potential for Ireland; £5 million to enhance the general tourism marketing effort, including addressing emerging challenges in the British market, furthering wider regional spread, and supporting smaller tourism enterprises; and the final £5 million to extend existing niche product or special interest marketing for 2001 in such areas as golf, cruising, walking and angling tourism.</P>
      <P>I understand that Bord Fáilte is currently finalising its proposals for the allocation of the additional expenditure to specific initiatives and campaigns in line with the budget decision. The Shannon region, in common with other regions of the country, will benefit from the increased emphasis and funding targeted at improving regional distribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 72 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study &ldquo;A Stadium for the New Century&rdquo; prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated the cost of the stadium at £230 million. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited have estimated the cost of the campus, excluding the stadium, at £320 million. This figure is based on work by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the other sporting facilities involved and on professional estimates as to the cost of commercial facilities planned for the campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> In putting the various facilities to public tender CSID decided to establish the potential for attracting private investment. CSID believes the private sector will be prepared to invest £150 million in the project, mostly for the commercial facilities. That investment, together with the private donation of £50 million, means that the estimated Exchequer cost of Sports Campus Ireland, including Stadium Ireland, is £350 million. Because all the facilities will go out to public tender and be the subject of an international commercial competition and because CSID wants to attract the best and most competitive bids, it is not possible at this stage to publish the detailed elements of the proposed investment. However, when the tender competitions are completed around the middle of this year, the value of each contract will be known and I will be able to give contracted figures to the House rather than best estimates.</P>
    <P>The cost of relocating staff currently working on the Abbotstown site is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The estimated costs for a stadium and campus of sporting excellence are set out at paragraphs 1.33 to 1.35 in the feasibility study &ldquo;A Stadium for the New Century&rdquo;. The study has been placed in the Library and published on the web.</P>
    <P>For ease of reference for the Deputy, the costs outlined in the study are as follows:</P>
    <P>Stadium costs</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The target set by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the Tourism Marketing Partnership is for an increase of 5% in overseas visitor numbers in 2001 to more than 6.6 million visitors. Britain is expected to continue to be the largest market for Ireland with almost 3.6 million visitors, North American visitors are expected to be in excess of one million, while visitors from Mainland Europe are expected to reach almost 1.5 million. Long haul markets, with Australia in a prominent position, are expected to generate almost half a million visitors.</P>
      <P>Ireland's best prospects in 2001 will continue to be the seven main markets: Britain, United States, Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy and Australia. Apart from these core markets, other emerging markets offering good potential for Ireland are Sweden and Spain.</P>

      <P>Since the establishment of the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis on 1 July 1999, I have not issued any directive in relation to the withholding of grants from any specific sporting organisation. The structures of any particular body are a matter, of course, for that body and its constituent members.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of grant assistance to sporting bodies and persons now rests with the sports council. Consequently, the establishment of criteria, terms and conditions, including conditions relating to the structure of any grant aided organisation, for the awarding of financial assistance is a matter for the council in accordance with the terms of the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan, I secured some £100 million for tourism product development, which will be spent in line with the commitment in the &ldquo;Review of the Action Programme for the Millennium, November 1999&rdquo;, to &ldquo;maintain substantial investment in the development of environmentally sustainable tourism products which promote year-round tourism.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The overall objective of the tourism measure, within the regional operational programmes, is to develop the tourism product in an environmental and sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases under-performing areas' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
      <P>All projects will be required to demonstrate environmental sustainability and to have regard to best practice in relation to environmental protection, including the findings from the &ldquo;Review of the Tourism and Environment Pilot Initiative, September 2000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is the implementing body for the tourism measure and decisions on grant approvals will be made by independent product management boards on the lines of those in place under the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-99.

The task forces were asked in 2000 to prepare new plans to respond to the drug problem in their areas.

While no new proposals have yet been approved, recommendations on funding for elements of three of the plans are currently before the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and a decision is expected shortly. It is anticipated that the remaining plans will be submitted over the coming months and forwarded to the Cabinet committee for approval in due course.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 included a provision towards the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates. An open tender competition was launched by Bord Fáilte in September 1997 and the successful tender was from Spencer Dock Consortium Limited for its proposed conference centre at Spencer Dock in Dublin's Docklands. In November 1998 the European Commission gave its approval, in principle, for the offer of a grant of 33 million ECU, £26 million, to the successful tenderer subject to a number of conditions, including the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State Aids rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, having secured EU Commission confirmation on permissible time limits for the grant drawdown, contract documentation was agreed and signed by Bord Fáilte and the developer, Spencer Dock Consortium Limited, by end <Col N="955" /> December 1999. The deadline set for drawdown of the grant was 31 December 2002 with major construction work to be under way by January 2001.</P>
    <P>Planning permission for the development, issued by Dublin Corporation in August 1999, was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Last July, An Bord Pleanála issued its decision, granting planning permission for the national conference centre element of the overall development but not for the bulk of the surrounding development.</P>
    <P>Since then, the developers have been considering their options in light of this planning decision. Options, of which I have been made aware, would require the provision of substantial additional public funding over and above the terms of the original grant offer from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Following consultations with Bord Fáilte and advice from the Attorney General, I consider that I am precluded from introducing any amendments to the public procurement process through which the Spencer Dock proposal emerged and the grant offer of £26 million was made. I have informed the developers accordingly and asked them to continue to consider with Bord Fáilte how to proceed within the context of the terms and conditions of the existing grant offer.</P>
    <P>As we are now at the end of January 2001 I expect Bord Fáilte to be in contact with the developers to confirm their position.</P>

      <P>Framework III of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to identify the 25 most deprived urban and rural communities to which will be delivered, under a targeted investment programme, a range of measures aimed at economic and community development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal will shortly be made to Government regarding implementation and operation of such a programme. Consultation was undertaken with the social partners on drawing up this proposal. A group within the community and voluntary pillar of the social partners expressed a desire for a more elaborate consultation, decision making and implementation process. The proposals which I will now bring to Government aim to address their concerns, particularly with regard to involvement of local partnership companies. <Col N="956" /> These proposals also aim to ensure that those charged with actual expenditure, and provision of facilities and services, have the scope to act quickly and deliver an accelerated programme of investment to these communities, which is the primary objective of this initiative. In consultation with the social partners, the Department has endeavoured to achieve the essential balance between local input into programme design and identification of priorities, and securing a clear administrative focus on the quick and efficient delivery of investment to address such priorities.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the targeted investment in disadvantaged areas programme will involve a structure which will include agencies currently responsible at local level for delivery of aspects of social policy, and provision for full consultation with local communities. I believe this structure will secure delivery of an effective and efficient investment programme which will be in keeping with Government policy in relation to preparation and implementation of a strategy for economic, social and cultural development at local level by the city and county development boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the aims of tourism policy is to concentrate a significant proportion of growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods. By the end of 1999, 73% of visitors were arriving outside the peak period of July and August and growth in off-peak and shoulder seasons had increased by nearly 9% in 1999 as opposed to 3.5% of an increase in peak visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>Just before Christmas, Bord Fáilte, in conjunction with the Tourism Marketing Partnership, launched its three year marketing strategy for the period 2001-03 and unveiled its detailed marketing programmes for 2001. A total marketing spend of the order of £90 million is envisaged for 2001 across all markets, of which £28 million is State expenditure and £62 million industry spend. The Tourism Marketing Partnership is designed to encourage synergy and complementarity between the marketing plans and programmes of the industry and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific marketing campaigns for Britain, Germany, the US and long haul markets have the greatest propensity to attract visitors to Ireland in the shoulder and off-peak seasons while the Discover Ireland domestic market campaign also <Col N="957" /> delivers well on this objective through the intensive promotion of spring, autumn and winter breaks.</P>
    <P>An annual marketing fund of £1 million has been available in recent year to Bord Fáilte to distribute to the regional tourism authorities, RTAs and Shannon Development. This marketing fund is intended to address the twin objectives of regionality and seasonality by allowing the RTAs and Shannon Development to undertake incremental marketing activities themselves and to assist their local trade to promote their facilities.</P>
    <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that Ireland's seasonal spread now compares quite favourably with most other destinations in temperate climates.</P>

      <P>Of 33 applications received for the 2000 sports capital programme from organisations with addresses in the Dublin 3, 5 and 9 postal districts, 13 were successful and received a combined allocation of £5,268,000.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the objectives of the programme, the successful applicants covered a wide spectrum of sporting and voluntary organisations, e.g. soccer, GAA and boxing clubs, the Morton athletics stadium, a scout unit and sport and social clubs and other community organisations.</P>
      <P>All unsuccessful applicants in 2000 were sent a report on the assessment of their respective applications, which was carried out in accordance with criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. Deadline for receipt of applications under the 2001 sports capital programme is 5 p.m. on 9 February 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition to the sports capital programme, the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, provides funding to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The Government set up the YPFSF in 1998 as part of its national drugs strategy, The three-year fund aims to attract young people in those areas &ndash; at risk of becoming involved in drugs &ndash; into more healthy and productive pursuits. An Exchequer contribution of £37 million has been allocated over a three year period, 1999 &ndash; 2001, for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas, of which 12 are <Col N="958" /> located in Dublin. Parts of Dublin 3 and 5 postal districts are covered by the north inner city task force and the Dublin north east task force areas respectively. In April 1999 the Government allocated over £25 million to support 295 facility and services projects in these areas over the next three years. Of this amount, over £24 million was allocated to 268 individual projects in Dublin, including £1.25 million to support six facility projects in the north inner city task force area and £870,000 to support seven facility projects in the Dublin north east.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The successful development of Irish tourism in recent years has created new challenges for the industry not only in terms of maintaining its competitive position internationally but also as regards competition for staff in a labour market where skills and shortages have become a major issue for all economic sectors, including tourism. This situation requires new and innovative responses from the industry and from the State institutions.</P>
      <P>For its part CERT, following extensive research and consultation with industry, launched a new strategic plan for the period 2000 to 2006. This is designed to deliver the objectives and programmes set out in the national development plan and involves a shift in the focus of the organisation, with an enhanced emphasis on promoting human resource management capability in the industry, and researching and benchmarking best practice. The industry itself will need smarter recruitment and retention programmes and innovative ways of increasing productivity if it is to maintain its pool of highly motivated, productive and committed skilled labour to respond to market demand for quality service and value for money.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to allocate £107 million under the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006 to CERT to help industry secure and retain a professional and skilled work force to meet existing and emerging needs in the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of tourism product and service. In this context over £16 million has been provided in my departmental Estimates for allocation to CERT in 2001 to enable the organisation to commence the implementation of its new strategic plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT has continued with its many initiatives designed to promote careers in the industry to the school leaving population generally. These include workshops for career guidance counsellors, a telephone careers information line, circulation of careers information to over 1,400 schools, FÁS offices, libraries, and youth organis<Col N="960" /> ations and the preparation of information packs for industry personnel giving career talks.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures outlined, two parallel initiatives are designed to further promote careers in the industry. The first of these, which was launched in October 2000, was CERT's annual careers road show which visited 16 venues countrywide and held over 70 sessions in various second level institutions. It was targeted at second level students from transition year to leaving certificate level and was implemented in partnership with the major industry bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants' Association of Ireland, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners' Association. It was widely advertised through local radio stations and newspapers.</P>
    <P>The second initiative was the launch of the careers magazine, <i>Get a Life in Tourism</i>. This magazine is a CERT joint venture with the industry bodies and highlights the variety of careers on offer in the sector. The numbers enrolling in tourism entry courses were maintained for the 2000-01 academic year despite stiff competition from other industries and educational courses.</P>
    <P>CERT is undertaking a pilot programme targeted at long-term unemployment blackspots which has proved to be very popular and successful with exceptionally good job prospects and participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses. The programme which is under way in Ballymun, Clondalkin and Merchants' Quay is to be extended to Waterford during 2001 and will be replicated in other parts of the country which have experienced particularly high levels of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>CERT's new nationwide programme to encourage people who have been out of the work force for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry has been running for nearly a year at this stage. It has proved extremely successful to date and it is projected that 6,000 adults will complete this programme by 2005.</P>
    <P>In a separate effort to boost recruitment levels I understand that tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Scotland and Wales which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland. Recruitment drives are being considered for other European locations. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS which welcomes employers to such recruitment drives. I understand that the Irish Hotels' Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual bodies are also participating in EURES, the European Employment Service, to help satisfy labour shortages in the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>To help address concerns in the tourism and hospitality industry in relation to recruitment and staff retention, CERT launched the new RETAIN initiative in the latter part of 2000. Under this initiative, financial assistance of up to £15,000 over a three year period will be available under certain conditions to businesses for improvement in human resources management. <Col N="961" /> Alongside the new scheme CERT will be running a series of courses for owners and general managers on modern human resource best practice.</P>
    <P>In a significant shift in the direction of support for the industry, CERT held a major conference on world class service in tourism and hospitality for general managers and senior executives in the industry in Dublin Castle in November 2000. Featuring a panel of international speakers and the findings of the latest international research carried out during 2000, the conference focused on best practice in human resources and operations management. It was attended by 150 of the key decision-makers from among Ireland's leading tourism industry enterprises.</P>
    <P>One of the key findings to emerge from the report, Hospitality Best Practice &ndash; A Benchmark Study, was the requirement for the tourism industry to improve its performance significantly. It emerged from the study that success will only come from focusing on customer needs and fully engaging employees in meeting those needs.</P>
    <P>In response to these findings, CERT proposes to work more closely with the industry in a number of areas specifically designed to improve operational performance. CERT is planning a number of management development initiatives to assist this process and is working with Excellence Ireland to develop a business excellence recognition scheme to promote the attainment of excellence within the industry and to provide a necessary framework within which management and staff can work towards higher levels of performance.</P>

      <P>In the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 I received approximately 4,400 applications from community and voluntary groups for grants under the sports capital programme. All these applicants were aware of the requirement of the programme to maintain satisfactory public liability insurance in respect of users, general public, etc., and none of them has ever indicated that this requirement posed any difficulties for them in their plans for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. Difficulties in acquiring public liability insurance have not been raised with me or with officials in my Department in the context of the provision of sporting facilities. The provision of playgrounds and playground facilities is not covered by the sports capital programme.</P>

      <P>The aims and objectives of the sports capital programme administered by my Department are to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities, to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation, to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities and to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport. It is open to any group meeting these objectives to apply for funding under this year's programme for which the closing date for receipt of completed applications is 9 February 2001.</P>
      <P>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, that the provision of open spaces, recreational and sports facilities and amenity areas specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. In this context I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 866 of 30 January 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>While the US economy has slowed down over recent months, it is not clear at this stage how severe or protracted the slowdown will prove to be. Obviously a very sharp and prolonged slowdown could have significant effects on Ireland, particularly if it substantially reduced the inflow of foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there are a range of factors at work which would help to ameliorate the effects of any slowdown in the US economy. These include the following.</P>
      <P>Economic conditions within the EU are, in contrast to the US, improving. Since this is the main market for the output of US owned companies in Ireland, they are somewhat less likely to be affected by any slowdown than those in the US. Much of the recent foreign investment into Ireland from the US have been strategic investments designed to operate under new management structures which achieve better efficiencies and margins than their US plants. Such operations would probably be one of the least likely to experience job cuts. Several major US companies which have made such investments in Ireland in recent years have recently made clear their intention to continue to grow their Irish operations despite a weakening in general market conditions. Most of the recent weakness in the US economy has been confined to the IT sector. While this is important to Ireland, it is by no means the only significant sector in terms of US owned investment in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of a major slowdown in the US economy the most vulnerable jobs in US multinationals in Ireland are those in relatively low skill areas where Ireland is becoming an uncompetitive location for manufacturing. These jobs are at risk anyway in the long-term whether or not the US has a recession. In this respect, a primary element of current IDA Ireland policy is to assist client companies to &ldquo;go up the value chain&rdquo;<Col N="964" /> into higher tech jobs requiring higher skilled and better paid employees. Companies are also being encouraged to put in new higher order functions such as research and development. The overall objective is to raise the strategic importance of the Irish operation within client corporations thereby embedding companies more firmly in the economy. This will help to secure employment levels into the future.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Irish economy with very low unemployment and strong demand for labour in most sectors means that Ireland is in a better position than it has been to weather the effects of any economic slowdown in the US economy. The impact of any slowdown in the US on Ireland will in large part be determined by how successful we are at maintaining a cost effective and efficient environment for foreign investment and business generally. Therefore, the recent signs of weakness in the US economy should, if anything, spur us on to progress a range of critical issues, including infrastructure provision, controlling inflation, deregulation and addressing the future skill needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the company cited by the Deputy, a world wide review is being undertaken by the company at the moment. It is expected that the review will be completed in February 2001. It is anticipated that the reduction in employment in Ireland will be in line with the 10% reduction that is expected for the company as a whole. There are approximately 1,600 employed by the company in Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department has not conducted a survey or commissioned research into the application of national wage agreements among non-unionised workers. Agreement on most elements of the employment relationship is left to the parties involved in line with our tradition of voluntarism. The exceptions to this rule relate mainly to the maintenance of a floor of rights as covered by our range of legislation. These rights now include a minimum wage and minimum holiday entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been provision in past national agreements to negotiate increases in excess of the basic pay terms and for increases not to be applied where firms are experiencing financial difficulty. The State has traditionally confined its <Col N="965" /> role to providing dispute resolution machinery to assist employers and employees in resolving any differences which might arise in local negotiations at enterprise level. It is not envisaged that this approach would change.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (No. 2) Order, 1996, set out the licensing system applicable to the manufacture, purchase and use of mammalian meat and bone meal for any purpose. Breaches of the above orders are offences under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966 and are punishable on summary conviction by a maximum fine of £1,500 or to six months imprisonment or both.</P>
      <P>Prosecutions in respect of breaches of the provisions of the 1966 order concerning the use of meat and bone meal have been taken against two companies and one individual. Convictions were secured in each case. In addition to the above, successful prosecutions have been taken against an individual and a company in respect of the use of poultry offal contrary to the provisions of the 1996 order as amended by the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment) Order, 1997.</P>

    <P>Notes on average tax payments</P>
    <P>(a), (b)PAYE figures</P>
    <P>(i)Income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries. It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income. It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>(ii)The average tax payment for each year in column (a) is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, for example, the 1996 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1996/97. This number excludes income earners on the PAYE tax record who are exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>The average tax payment for each year in column (b) is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the total number of income earners on the PAYE tax record including those who are exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>(c)Farming figures</P>
    <P>(i)In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units assessed to tax for the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, for example, the 1996 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1996/97. These numbers exclude cases who <Col N="973" /> are not required to file annual tax returns and whose position is reviewed periodically because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>(ii)The figures for averages do not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession. Farm tax represents a fraction of their overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</P>
    <P>(iii)Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be precisely distinguished. Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>(d)Other self-employed figures</P>
    <P>(i)The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year, subject to certain technical adjustments, from tax units whose main source of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (c).</P>
    <P>These numbers exclude cases who are not required to file annual tax returns and whose position is reviewed periodically because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>General Notes</P>
    <P>(i)A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously. This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii)Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and dividend witholding tax are not included in the calculations. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>

      <P>My Department is in consultation with the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation regarding the fees to be charged for the third generation mobile phone licences. Under section 111(6) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 96 of 1998, my consent to the charging of a fee for such licences is required. In fulfilling my statutory responsibility I will be concerned to ensure that the fees paid adequately reflect the value of the licences issued, taking account of the non-financial obligations involved in the licence terms, and of the importance of 3G to the development of the telecoms infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General to decide whether he should review the process of the award of the second GSM licence. The Comptroller and Auditor General is independent of the Government. I have no power to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake any review or investigation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government announced a further package of measures on housing on 15 June 2000 which are specifically aimed at strengthening the position of first time buyers in the market. These measures arise from the most recent study into the housing market by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, economic consultants.</P>
      <P>The third Bacon report reviewed and evaluated the effects of previous measures taken by Government and other recent developments in housing demand, housing supply and house prices. The study also included a general review of the evolution in the market since the publication of the previous studies by the same consultancy firm. The Government had previously taken a series of actions which was designed to increase housing supply and moderate the increase in house prices. While these measures have had an impact, the Government proposed a range of further initiatives to deal with the continued rising demand for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000 gave effect to the taxation aspects of these measures and involved a restructuring of stamp duty on residential property and the introduction of a new 2% anti-speculative housing tax. The Act introduced a three tiered stamp duty structure for first time <Col N="975" /> buyers, owner occupiers other than first time buyers and investors. I increased the exemption from stamp duty from £60,000 to £150,000 in the case of first time buyers and for other owner occupiers to £100,000. Rates of duty for first time buyers at values up to £300,000 are now 25% less than for other owner occupiers. In particular, the revised regime is structured to facilitate those who are trying to buy their first home and who are faced with particular difficulties in the market at the present time. Many first time owner occupier buyers are now either exempt from stamp duty or pay at a reduced rate.</P>
    <P>A flat 9% stamp duty rate is now also charged <Col N="976" /> on all categories of investors buying new or secondhand residential property. The Government decided to apply this rate of 9% to all non-owner occupier purchasers of new and secondhand residential property, irrespective of the value of the property, as it was considered that the previous graduated scale of rates might encourage investments in the lower end of the market. This would not be a desirable development from the point of view of the first time purchaser as it would bring further pressure on prices at the lower end of the market.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty rates now applying for secondhand residential properties are as follows:</P>

    <P>The new 2% anti-speculative tax applies, for a three year period, to second and additional residential properties acquired on or after 15 June 2000. The tax is a taxation measure specifically aimed at discouraging short-term speculative investment in the housing market which is causing difficulties for first time buyers. The third Bacon report pointed to speculative demand as a factor in driving up house prices.</P>
    <P>In increasing the stamp duty first time buyer limit from £60,000 to £150,000 and in giving a 25% reduction on the &ldquo;other owner occupier&rdquo; category of rates applying between £150,000 and £300,000, I believe I have responded fully, as recently as last June, to the needs of first time buyers. However, I will keep the position, including the existing bands, under review.</P>
    <P>The first time buyer's grant offers assistance to people who are first time purchasers of new houses. There are no proposals to extend the grant to first time purchasers of secondhand houses as any additional grant aid would, in present market circumstances, be likely to be absorbed in higher prices.</P>
    <P>These taxation measures, in addition to a number of other further measures which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, have announced in this regard, are part of the Government's ongoing response to the problems in the housing sector and should help restore balance in the housing market.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where an employer incurs an expense which is wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade, a deduction for such an expense is allowable in computing the profits of the trade for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>Thus, if in the course of the trade an employer incurs expenses in connection with the provision of training courses for staff, such expenses would, in general, be deductible for tax purposes. Expenditure both on in-house and external work related training courses for staff would be allowable. As such costs are a constituent element in arriving at the profits of the business no specific record of such expenditure is maintained by Revenue and, therefore, there is no basis on which to provide an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer in terms of the amount of tax relief allowed.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme, which comes under the aegis <Col N="977" /> of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is a driver and £12,500 if the qualifying person is a passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise duty on up to 600 gallons of fuel per year and for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme is worth some £22 million per annum to the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April 2001, and from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme will be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax based scheme already have access to transport, which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at eligible people with disabilities who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's request to have this decision reversed, he will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, stated in reply to Parliamentary Question 2342/01 yesterday that he does not intend to remove this restriction.</P>

      <P>Phase 1 of the national breast screening programme has commenced and is covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and is targeting 140,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the nature, scope and extent of the national breast screening programme has determined that it can only proceed on a gradual basis. Screening, therefore, takes place on an area by area basis and is done by district electoral divisions. BreastCheck aims to screen women within two years of becoming eligible. Women will be invited for screening and are asked to respond to the invitation within 21 days. BreastCheck then aims to give women an <Col N="978" /> appointment at an appropriate location within eight to 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by BreastCheck that the person named is on its register and according to its current screening plan, the aim is to screen that particular area-DED in the second half of 2001. However, if the woman has symptoms or is worried about breast cancer for a particular reason, she should consult her family doctor for advice.</P>

      <P>In the current tax year, in order for a taxpayer to claim medical expenses on behalf of a parent, he/she must be in receipt of the dependent relative allowance on behalf of that relative. From 6 April 2001, however, this restriction will be abolished and a taxpayer will be able to claim medical expenses relief in respect of costs incurred on behalf of his/her parent. The taxpayer can make a claim to the inspector of taxes for relief provided the amount has not been recouped through a health board, insurance body or by any other such method.</P>
      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Private patients are liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants fees in addition to the statutory charges.</P>
      <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant or by obtaining a private bed. However, I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine the circumstances of the case and to establish whether they can assist this person towards the payment of costs.</P>

      <P>The provision of nursing home care is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and, in particular, section 7 of that Act which deals with payments by health boards towards costs of maintenance of dependent persons in nursing homes. The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 to 1998 set down the requirements for the assessment of dependency and means for any person wishing to avail of a nursing home subvention under the scheme.</P>
      <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. The Deputy will be aware of the shortcomings in the operation of the scheme highlighted in the Ombudsman's recently published report and a number of measures have already been taken to deal with some of these problems. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever further measures may be necessary arising from the findings of this review and the report of the Ombudsman and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

      <P>The position is that the <i>Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour</i>&ndash; fifth edition, 1998 &ndash; prepared and published by the Medical Council and applicable to all doctors states clearly that it is in the interests of both doctors and patients that accurate records are always kept. This requirement extends to the keeping of proper records concerning prescriptions.</P>
      <P>The guide further recommends that these records be retained for an adequate period and not disposed of without due recourse to advice from legal and insurance bodies. Doctors are also reminded within these rules of their responsibility in advising administrative authorities of the importance of the storage of medical records in such a manner that facilitates easy access to clinical staff when necessary for patient management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to a Parliamentary Question on 13 December 2000, I informed the Deputy that on 12 December I met the chairperson, chief executive officer and the national medical director of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; IBTS &ndash; and was briefed concerning a number of strategies which the board is considering to further reduce or minimise the possible risk of transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the measures which is under consideration and in respect of which a final decision has not been taken by the board, concerns the deferral of donors who resided in the United Kingdom for a cumulative period of six months or more between 1980 and 1996. As the Deputy is aware, the IBTS is also considering the deferral of donors who themselves have had a blood transfusion; such donors are deferred at present for a period of 12 months after a transfusion. Deferrals of donors in such combined circumstances would reduce the current donor pool by approximately 20-25% which would have serious implications for the hospital services and consequently for <Col N="981" /> patient care. The IBTS is also considering additional measures to reduce the current level of outdating of red cells at the IBTS and at hospitals, increase the current donor base and replace plasma and cryoprecipitate &ndash; a plasma derived product &ndash; with similar products from BSE-free areas. The IBTS is discussing this product replacement strategy with the Irish Medicines Board, the regulatory authority for medicinal products.</P>
    <P>In considering additional measures to reduce or minimise a possible risk of vCJD, there is a balance of risks involved. Implementation of measures outlined above could result in a sustained shortage of blood which would have significant implications for patient safety. Given the need to take full account of the balance of risks involved, the IBTS has arranged a special conference for 15 February which will involve national and international experts on vCJD and blood transfusion. The conference will consider existing and planned strategies of the IBTS relevant to vCJD and a special board meeting has been arranged for 28 February to consider the outcome of the conference and decide on the most appropriate strategies in the light of the expert opinion. The IBTS will also liaise with the CJD Advisory Group in relation to any proposals relevant to vCJD which it proposes to implement.</P>
    <P>As I advised the Deputy on 13 December 2000, the measures under consideration could have major implications for the current activities of the IBTS. I have assured the board that I will ensure it is adequately resourced to introduce new measures which are considered necessary to further improve blood safety.</P>

      <P>I have been given to understand that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; IBTS &ndash; has examined its records from September 1999 to date and there is no report of rodents ever having gained access to the components laboratory at the Cork site. In fact, following investment of approximately £500,000, a new components laboratory was procured in 1998 to meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board which is the regulatory authority for the blood transfusion service. However, I also understand that there has been rodent activity at other parts of the site which has been addressed. A report which was prepared for the IBTS by relevant experts in October 2000 indicated that there was no evidence of such activity at that time.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 10 January 2001, the board of the IBTS approved the submission to the Department of a draft planning brief for a new transfusion centre to replace existing facilities. My Department is currently examining this submission as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the primary childhood immunisation programme is to protect the child population against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Policy in this area is based on the advice of the national experts, primarily the national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
      <P>MMR vaccine is available free of charge from family doctors under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this scheme. The MMR vaccine has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective. On the basis of currently available information there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines. Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time.</P>
      <P>The information currently available to my Department is that separate measles or mumps vaccines are not available in this country.</P>
      <P>With regard to public concern about the MMR vaccine, the expert advice available indicates that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and either chronic inflammatory bowel disease or autism. This is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge parents to have their children immunised with the MMR vaccine in accordance with current recommendations. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any <Col N="985" /> concerns they may have with their general practitioners before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>In June last the Government introduced a wide range of measures in Action on Housing including measures to discourage speculators pricing first time buyers out of home ownership; major reductions in stamp duty with an exemption from stamp duty for first time buyers purchasing a second hand house priced up to £150,000; and significant improvements to the terms and conditions of a number of the social housing options including the local authority shared ownership and affordable housing schemes. The indications to date of the impact of the measures taken in Action on Housing are positive. House price increases are moderating, housing output has increased and first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time buyers grant offers assistance to people who are first time purchasers of new <Col N="987" /> houses. I have no proposals to extend the grant to first time purchasers of second hand houses as any additional grant aid would, in present market circumstances, be likely to be absorbed in higher prices.</P>
    <P>The Government's National Climate Change <Col N="988" /> Strategy published in October 2000 contains a commitment to adjusting the new house grant to encourage energy efficiency in new housing. Work on developing this commitment is under way in my Department.</P>

      <P>Serviced land initiative schemes are funded by my Department at a 40% rate. The value of recoupments made to local authorities to date on that basis amounts to £9.2 million.</P>
      <P>The latest returns from local authorities &ndash; September 2000 &ndash; showed that a total of 20,784 sites had been completed nationally. A total of 3,600 of these sites were located in the areas of the four Dublin local authorities and 7,250 in the greater Dublin area, including Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow. A further 50,227 sites were reported to be at construction nationally, 12,785 in the Dublin area and 18,745 in greater Dublin. While my Department does not have details of the actual number of new house starts to date under the initiative, generally, once work on the provision of services has commenced, the associated housing can be constructed in parallel. However, the rate at which new houses will come on stream will depend on factors such as progress by developers in submission of planning applications, etc.</P>
      <P>Undeveloped sites under the serviced land initiative are currently not liable for rates and I understand from the Minister for Finance that there are no plans to change that position in the Valuation Bill, 2000.</P>

However, analysis of house purchase loan survey data available to my Department, which includes information voluntarily provided by borrowers covering some 40% of all mortgage-based housing transactions, suggests the following spread of house purchases for 2000 for every tenth percentile of house price up to £300,000:</P>

      <Quest>the guidelines and criteria for the granting of diet allowance supplements to diabetics or others by the health boards; and if the system can be explained so that payments are transparent and more predictable.</Quest>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health boards payments who have been prescribed a diet as a result of a medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their need, may qualify for a diet supplement. A supplement will only be paid in respect of certain diets and in most cases the diet must be prescribed by a hospital consultant, a hospital registrar or a general practitioner. A diabetic diet in one of the diets for which a supplement is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation governing the payment of supplementary welfare allowance and diet supplement is provided for in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and in regulations SI No. 382 of 1995 and SI No. 190 of 1996. Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable varies depending on which category of diet has been prescribed by <Col N="993" /> the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his/her dependants. Diet supplements are paid subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any excess assessable means towards their food costs. The method used to calculate the payment of SWA and diet supplement is provided for in legislation. It is estimated that one third of a single person's income is spent on food. The amount of a low cost diet supplement has been determined as being £27 less one third of a single person's income. In the case of a high cost diet this is £35 less one third of a single persons income. In the case of couples one sixth of the income is calculated.</P>
    <P>The present basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1997 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases. The SWA scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations and a fundamental examination of the diet supplement will be undertaken in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special old age contributory pension was introduced by me in April 1999 for those self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group. The pension is paid to those who have at least five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants. Similar pensions are paid to people whose claim is based on pre-1953 insurance, introduced in the 2000 budget. The current personal rate is £48 per week and this will increase to £53 in April 2001. There are almost 4,150 people in receipt of this special pension and it is not anticipated that there will be <Col N="994" /> any great change in the number of recipients, at least in the short-term.</P>
    <P>In our Action Programme for the Millennium the Government committed itself to implementing a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this group of people found themselves. Any proposed changes would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>If a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, including an increase in respect of a spouse, the spouse continues to receive the payment for six weeks after the death. This is to prevent the sudden loss of payment at this time.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, she and her late husband were in receipt of an invalidity pension in their own right. She was not in receipt of an increase on her late husband's pension claim and, therefore, no continuing payment after death applies in this case. Her pension continues to be paid to her.</P>
      <P>There are various other schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with after death and funeral expenses. These include, as detailed, the payment of a bereavement grant to insured people and their families. An application for bereavement grant has been received from the person concerned and payment of this grant will issue to her shortly.</P>
      <P>A number of important changes have, however, been introduced to improve these arrangements. These include an enhanced bereavement grant of £500, the introduction of a once-off payment of £1,000 to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow's or widower's contributory pension, a one parent family payment or a bereavement grant. In addition, a number of additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to improve the scheme of six weeks after death payments were also made.</P>
      <P>Any further changes in relation to the scheme of six weeks after death payments would have to be considered in the context of future budgets and within available resources.</P>

      <P>The budget provided for the extension of maternity and adoptive leave by four weeks to 18 weeks from early April. The Government subsequently decided to bring forward this measure. Entitlement to maternity benefit is linked to entitlement to maternity leave. In order to extend the duration of maternity and adoptive leave both the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, have to be amended by way of regulations. However, these regulations, to be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, require a positive motion of approval to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the amendments can take effect. I understand that it is hoped that a resolution approving the draft will be passed by both Houses in the near future.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of both the Maternity Protection Act and the Adoptive Leave Act the extended duration of maternity and adoptive leave will only apply to people who give their employers four weeks notice of their intention to take the extended leave following the approval of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Provision for the extension of Maternity Benefit to 18 weeks is included in the Social Welfare Bill which will be going through the House shortly. These provisions will become effective from the date on which the extended leave becomes effective. In addition to the extension of paid maternity leave, the budget also provided for an increase of four weeks additional unpaid maternity leave and an extension of all employment rights, including the award of credited contributions for any additional maternity leave taken. Regulations governing the award of these credited contributions will be provided for shortly.</P>
      <P>Further improvements announced in the budget include an increase of £8 in the minimum rates of payment for maternity and adoptive benefit from £90.70 to £98.70 a week and a £10.20 increase in the maximum rates from £172.80 to £183. These increases will come into effect from 2 April 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the implementation of the increases in maternity and adoptive leave announced in the budget is that in accordance with the budget announcement, the increases in the periods of maternity leave will be applicable to women commencing maternity leave on or after 2 April 2001. This date is in line with the introduction of other social welfare increases announced in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give people the maximum possible benefit from the proposed extension of maternity leave, I, together with my colleagues, the Ministers for <Col N="997" /> Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, intend to have the extension of the duration of maternity leave introduced at the earliest possible date which complies with the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>To provide for the increased entitlements to maternity leave, it is necessary to amend the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, by means of an order under that Act. The order requires a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The timing of the making of the order will depend on the completion of the drafting of the order and compliance with the necessary Oireachtas procedures. The order is being finalised at present by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office. I would like to assure all Deputies that this work is being afforded the utmost priority.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have the order in place when a woman is giving the statutory minimum four weeks notice to her employer of going on maternity leave, in order to comply with the notice requirements laid down in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, in respect of paid leave. The entitlement to the extra paid maternity leave will apply, therefore, to women who can comply with this four week notification requirement.</P>
    <P>As the notice requirements under the Maternity Protection Act are different for unpaid leave, it will be possible to bring in the entitlement to the extra four weeks unpaid leave for any woman who has four weeks or more of her paid maternity leave left on the date on which the order is made. It is intended to provide that entitlement to the increased periods of maternity leave will be based on the date of commencement of leave rather than the expected date of confinement.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to make the order as early as possible in February. This will in effect mean that the increased entitlement to paid maternity leave will apply to women commencing maternity leave some time in March and whose babies are due sometime in April. It is not, however, possible at this stage to indicate the effective date of the order.</P>
    <P>In the case of a baby due in mid-March, the woman would be required, under the Act, to commence maternity leave at the latest by mid-February and to give her employer notice of her intention to take leave in mid-January. As the order was not in place at that time, she would not be entitled to the extra paid maternity leave. She would, however, be entitled to the four weeks extra unpaid additional leave.</P>

      <P>The Statute of the Inter<Col N="998" /> national Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 139 states have signed the Statute and, of these, 27 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>The Government has been advised by the Attorney General that an amendment to the Constitution is required before the State may ratify the Statute. The Government has accordingly authorised the drafting of a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution and I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked the chairman of the Government Legislation Committee to arrange for the draft Bill to be given priority in the Government's current legislation programme.</P>
      <P>Assuming a successful outcome to a Constitutional referendum it will then be necessary for my Department to bring forward the necessary legislation to give effect to the Statute in Irish law. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is a very complex instrument and requires detailed consideration to establish exactly what would be required by way of amending legislation to enable us to ratify the Statute. The legislation required to give effect in Irish law to the Statute will be very substantial considering the complex issues that arise to be dealt with but I can assure the Deputy that the legislation will be introduced as quickly as possible having regard to other high priority legislative requirements.</P>

      <P>These two offices are the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which will consider applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which will consider applications for a declaration at appeal stage. A decision on the application in question will be made upon receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>the situation in relation to his Department or any agency under the aegis of his Department with regard to the control, powers, involvement, licensing of or co-operation with the horse drawn carriages on St. Stephen's Green or elsewhere; if these carriages are licensed or authorised; if these carriages must be insured against liability arising from damage or injury; if his attention has been drawn to the potential dangers of a runaway horse and carriage; if carriage operators are required to have any insurance or bond against which a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9 can make a claim or seek compensation.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the regulations governing the operation of horse drawn carriages are contained in the Dublin Carriages Acts, 1853 &ndash; 1855. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda issues a licence to the proprietors of horse drawn vehicles each year. All carriages and horses are brought to the Carriage Office by their owners where carriages are examined by public service vehicle inspectors and horses are examined by a veterinary inspector from Dublin Corporation and a representative from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Trust. A micro-chip is inserted in the animal which can readily identify it at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I understand that each carriage must display the carriage licence with a photograph of the owner attached, a brass plate, with the operators name and address, licence number, and the number of passengers the operator may carry as well as the new Dublin carriage plate. The operator must also wear and display the badge and carry a copy of his/her driving licence with a photo attached. There is no legal obligation to have insurance on these vehicles but it is prudent for any business concern to have appropriate insurance cover which is ultimately a matter for the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>The grounds upon which an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a person arriving in the State, whether that person is visa required or not, are set out section 5(2) of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended. In cases <Col N="1000" /> where consideration is being given to the refusal of a passenger under these provisions, immigration officers have access to advice from local Garda management as well as from members of the Garda national immigration bureau together with the services of professional translators as necessary.</P>
      <P>Immigration officers will often also carry out enquiries with relevant third parties, including persons awaiting the passenger's arrival in the State. A facility is also available to contact officials in my Department on a 24 hour basis who may in turn may make further enquiries with the Department of Foreign Affairs duty officer if necessary. Such contact can of course be made directly during normal working hours. In addition, at my instigation an arrangement is now being put in place which will provide for an out of office hours channel of communication between immigration officers and the work permit section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should point out that the Garda national immigration bureau, which was established last June, has overall responsibility for immigration controls at ports of entry to the State and is developing this service on an ongoing basis, based on its assessment of the operational needs arising.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for promoting Dublin as a tourist destination rests with Dublin Tourism. The most recent study of visitor attitudes to Dublin is the Dublin Visitor Survey, published this month by Dublin Institute of Technology and Dublin Tourism. It concludes, regarding the attractions for tourists to Dublin, that: the vast majority (94.8%) of visitors feel that the people of Dublin are friendly and hospitable; more than 85% of respondents believe Dublin city is safe and a similar proportion believe it is an easy city to get around; Dublin is generally perceived to have a good supply of visitor attractions and restaurants; some 83.6% of visitors agree that Dublin has a rich cultural life and 76.6% say that there are plenty of museums to visit.</P>
      <P>On the negative side: almost one in four visitors state that Dublin is a dirty city; and nearly a third of respondents believe that prices in Dublin are too high, although 60% of visitors believe that Dublin still offers good value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From this survey, it is clear that Dublin continues to exert a considerable attraction for overseas visitors. The challenge facing the tourism sector in Dublin is to manage its own success and, indeed, the impact of overall economic success on tourism. It is clear from this visitor survey that <Col N="1002" /> one of the most pressing measures required, to make Dublin an even more attractive visitor centre, is to break the vicious cycle of litter in the city. The Deputy will be well aware of my oft-repeated views in this regard.</P>

Priorities for major facilities are considered and assessed in consultation with the relevant national governing bodies of sport.</P>
      <P>The greatly increased funding for sport provided by the Government over the past three and a half years has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres. The range of services and facilities to be provided at Sports Campus Ireland will be among the best in the world. The development of the new indoor athletic facility at Morton Stadium, outdoor tracks in various parts of the country, the opening later this year of the national 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick, the increased funding for local authority swimming pool programme, the newly refurbished national boxing stadium, the development of Croke Park and county GAA and League of Ireland grounds are just some examples of the very significant progress in the development of high quality, appropriate and sustainable sport and recreation facilities since this Government took office.</P>

      <P>Under the 2000 Sports Capital Programme, 52 clubs and organisations from County Kildare applied for funding; 29 of them receiving a combined total of £2,001,500 in allocations under the programme.</P>
      <P>All of the applications were assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme. In assessing the applications received, consideration is given to the population base of each county and provision is made for the equitable geographical spread of funds and for the spread of funds among different sports and community groups, having regard to the range of existing facilities which have been funded in previous years.</P>
      <P>The 2000 programme is now completed. Under the sports capital programme there is a separate application process each year and applications made in a previous year cannot be considered under the following year's programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications are currently invited under the 2001 programme. The closing date for receipt of <Col N="1004" /> these applications is 9 February 2001 and it is open to voluntary organisations and clubs, including athletics clubs, in County Kildare to apply for funding under this year's programme.</P>
    <P>The amount of annual funding available to the swimming pool programme has been increased fivefold from £3 million in 1999 to £15 million in each of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, to support the refurbishment of existing pools and towards the construction costs of new pools.</P>

      <P>The Irish Sports Council is responsible for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport in Ireland and provides annual grants to national governing bodies of sport, including Swim Ireland, the national swimming federation, to assist in its work for the advancement of swimming at all levels throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In relation to facilities for competitive swimmers, my Department has allocated a grant of just under £6 million towards the construction of a 50 metre swimming pool at Limerick University. Construction is progressing and the pool is scheduled for completion later this year. An annual operational grant of £190,000 will ensure pool access to meet the training needs of Ireland's high performance swimmers.</P>
      <P>The Government has more recently approved proceeding the development of an aquatic and leisure centre at the Campus and Stadium Ireland site at Abbotstown, incorporating a full competition size 50-metre pool. Construction work on this facility is expected to commence this year with a view to completion in time for the Special Olympics which will be held in Dublin in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also approved a considerably accelerated programme of investment in refurbishment and provision of new pools under the local authority swimming pool programme. My Department now has £45 million funding for this programme over the three year period 2000-2002, effectively increasing the annual budget <Col N="1005" /> from £3 million per annum to £15 million over these three years. Local authorities have been invited to submit proposals and a total of 51 such proposals were received in my Department by the closing date of 31 July 2000. In assessing these proposals I will be having particular regard to a report commissioned from sports facility specialists ILAM Ltd. on the condition of pools constructed by local authorities between 1996 and 1981 and their finding that 30 pools are in need of specific refurbishment.</P>
    <P>Under the swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room and ancillary accommodation that relates directly to the swimming pool. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives prompt consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the foregoing programmes will result in a range of high quality swimming facilities which will complement the ongoing work of the Irish Sports Council, the National Coaching and Training Centre and the relevant national governing body in the development of the sport of swimming on both a competitive and leisure basis.</P>

      <P>Under the 2000 sports capital programme, 52 clubs and organisations from Country Kildare applied for funding; 29 of them receiving a combined total of £2,001,500 in allocations under the programme.</P>
      <P>All of the applications were assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme. In assessing the applications received, consideration is given to the population base of each county and provision is made for the equitable geographical spread of funds and for the spread of funds among different sports and community groups, having regard to the range of existing facilities which have been funded in previous years.</P>
      <P>The 2000 programme is now completed. Under the sports capital programme there is a separate application process each year and applications made in a previous year cannot be considered under the following year's programme.</P>
      <P>Applications are currently invited under the 2001 programme. The closing date for receipt of these applications is 9 February, 2001 and it is open to voluntary organisations and clubs, including athletics clubs, in County Kildare to apply for funding under this year's programme.</P>
      <P>The amount of annual funding available to the swimming pool programme has been increased fivefold from £3 million in 1999 to £15 million in each of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, to support the refurbishment of existing pools and towards the construction costs of new pools.</P>
      <P>Under the revised 2000 swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are to be made available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project and not exceeding 90% of the eligible cost for projects located in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>There are 46 proposals from local authorities under consideration in my Department at present under the swimming pool programme, including two proposals from Kildare County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has received a submission from the organisation referred to by the Deputy, regarding the funding of postgraduate students and the importance of the research carried out by them.</P>
      <P>Students studying at postgraduate level may apply for financial assistance under the terms of the higher education grants scheme or, if appropriate, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme. For 2000-01 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £887 respectively.</P>
      <P>A postgraduate grantholder is also eligible to have his-her fees paid up to a maximum amount of £3,064.</P>
      <P>Last October, the student support schemes were amended to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year, 2000-01.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full time and part time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the view expressed in the submission, referred to by the Deputy, that postgraduate students are an intrinsic part of the research infrastructure in Ireland but I would not accept that this Government has ignored its role in this country's prosperity. Increasing the number of people with higher degrees is an important national strategic objective. Apart from the general strategic objective of ensuring a vibrant pool of high quality postgraduates, the success of the substantial investment in our research capability <Col N="1011" /> is dependent on an adequate supply of high quality graduates.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Government of Ireland research scholarships are awarded by the Irish Research Council for the humanities and social sciences. More than 200 postgraduate scholarships have been awarded by the council since its establishment in 1998, including 93 awards for the academic year 2000-01. These awards attract a maintenance allowance of £8,000 per annum for a maximum of three years.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced the establishment of the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. The new council will be putting in place, within these fields of study, similar post-graduate scholarship arrangements to those applying in the humanities and social science areas.</P>
    <P>Under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is co-funded under the European regional development fund, third-level institutions compete for funding for institutional research programmes. These programmes can include the awarding by the colleges of post-graduate scholarships. A total of 236 such awards have been made since the launch of the first cycle of the programme in 1999. The <i>per capita</i> amount awarded for scholarships varies according to institution and field of study.</P>
    <P>Forty nine post-graduate scholarships were awarded in 2000 under the postgraduate R&amp;D skills development initiative in the technological sector. These scholarships are valued at some £7,000 annually.</P>

      <P>However, this condition may be waived in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years two special grants have issued to primary schools and to post primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first special grant was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each. The grant issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to £2,500, while disadvantaged schools received £5,320.</P>
      <P>A second special grant issued to all primary and post primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or fewer. Post primary schools also received £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £1,540 was paid to all schools with fewer than 200 recognised pupils. At primary level the total value of these two grants was approximately £7.7 million, while at second level the two grants amounted to £5.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to issuing grants, to schools my Department also issued comprehensive guidelines to schools on the types of resources that the grant money could be used to purchase. At primary level these guidelines took the form of a publication called &ldquo;Book Choice&rdquo;&ldquo;Guidelines <Col N="1013" /> for Primary Schools&rdquo; which issued in early 1999 and departmental circular 35/99 which issued in December 1999. At post primary level departmental circular M16/99 &ldquo;Guidelines for reading at second level&rdquo; was issued to schools in May 1999 and departmental circular M51/99 was issued in December 1999.</P>
    <P>These guidelines make it quite clear that the grants were intended to assist schools in developing their library resource materials. Indeed &ldquo;Book Choice&rdquo; encouraged schools to liaise with the public library service when purchasing books for school libraries. I would add that, in the course of visits to schools by my Department's inspectors, it would be normal practice for inspectors to look at the resources available in schools' libraries.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of schools using the moneys received in respect of these grants to purchase textbooks. My Department operates, at both primary and post primary levels, annual schemes to assist schools with the purchase of textbooks for disadvantaged pupils. Accordingly, there should be no reason for schools to use the library grants for this purpose.</P>

As a consequence, my Department directly supports the educational needs of the community served by ICON through additional funding and staffing support for schools under the new programme for pupils in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds. This provision now incorporates schools in the urban dimension of breaking the cycle and schools in the latter project are being allocated additional funding under the new programme.</P>
      <P>The stay in school retention at second level &ndash; SSRI &ndash; which incorporates learning from the eight-15 early school leaver initiative &ndash; ESLI &ndash; about the importance of the integrated delivery of the services of a range of statutory and voluntary agencies to children at risk and their families.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme promotes parental collaboration with teachers in the children's learning programme and inclusion of the schools in the support teacher project.</P>
      <P>My Department also funds a pre-school for children in the area. Additional programmes include a Youthreach and VTOS provision, adult literacy programmes channelled through the City of Dublin VEC, adult and community education and youth services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Dublin Inner City Partnership is supported in the following ways: a representative of my Department's inspectorate has been <Col N="1015" /> assigned to its education and training sub-committee. This representative advises on the planning and development of measures to tackle educational disadvantage in the partnership area. The partnership also has the services of an education co-ordinator who is funded by my Department. It is open to the group to seek the advice of the co-ordinator with a view to the inclusion of proposals within the overall partnership plan.</P>
    <P>A nominee from my inspectorate acts as Department representative for the Dublin north-east inner city integrated services process which is part of the ICON area. This nominee regularly meets the chairpersons of the two education task groups of the integrated services process with a view to furthering action on educational matters within my Department. In addition, he liaises with the education co-ordinator of the Dublin Inner City Partnership with a view to co-ordinat<Col N="1016" /> ing strategies to combat educational disadvantage in the area. The integrated services process is supporting a more focused and co-ordinated response by statutory agencies to the needs of the local community.</P>
