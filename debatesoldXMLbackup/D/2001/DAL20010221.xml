      <P>Arising from the exchanges on the Order of Business yesterday concerning the reasons given by my office for the disallowance of Private Notice Questions and Standing Order 31 matters, I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify matters. My office inadvertently referred to the Taoiseach's announcement as a statement when conveying the reasons for the disallowance, and the resulting confusion is regretted. However, in doing so I must stress that my ruling on the Standing Order 31 matters and Private Notice Questions was not affected by whether the Taoiseach chose to make a statement or an announcement. My ruling that the issue was more appropriate to a substantive motion was correct and both my predecessor and I have ruled on many occasions that allegations against an officeholder can only be dealt with by substantive motion and not by exchanges across the floor of the House. I should point out that a motion under Standing Order 31 is a motion to adjourn the House. It is not a substantive motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter raised concerned the clearing of the Press Gallery yesterday. I received a report <Col N="2" /> on this matter. It has been the long established practice that the Public Gallery and the Press Gallery are cleared where the Dáil is suspended in circumstances of disorder, when a Member who has been named refuses to leave the House. In other circumstances, where the Dáil is suspended for a short duration, for example, where a Minister is delayed in arriving for Question Time, the galleries would not normally be cleared. Yesterday, due to a misunderstanding, the practice was initiated as it was thought Deputy Rabbitte had been named and was refusing to leave, which was not the case. This is regretted and I am putting in place procedures to ensure that such a misunderstanding will not recur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to accept your apology.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow a brief comment but we cannot have a debate on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your ruling this morning. On this side of the House we try to be orderly and to operate within Standing Orders. We are glad for your clarification this morning. <Col N="3" /> There was a serious misunderstanding. We tried to raise the Deputy Ned O'Keeffe affair and the conflict between what he had said and what the Taoiseach had said, first, by way of Standing Order 31 motions. Then we filed Private Notice Questions. Even though your advice was that it would be appropriate to raise the issue by substantive motion, we did not have a mechanism for doing that. I will be returning to it this morning. The Taoiseach must come into the House to explain the situation and must answer questions, and nothing else will be satisfactory. However, I will try to do that in accordance with your ruling. I accept what you have said this morning and there is no challenge from our side of the House to what you have said.</P>
      <P>On the clearing of the Public Gallery and the Press Gallery yesterday, you should return to that again. This is the national Parliament. Sometimes it looks like a five-day week part-time parliament but the public are entitled to be in the gallery to look at us here and listen to debates, and the press are entitled to be up there to report on what is happening here. It is a serious issue when the Dáil is suspended for five minutes that there are persons who think they have the authority to clear out the public and the press. That is a serious issue and I do not believe that what you have said this morning, even though it is welcome, is sufficient to meet our concerns. I would like you to come to us again, perhaps tomorrow morning on the Order of Business, on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome your statement of clarification. I fully accept the decisions that you took, the manner in which they were taken and your explanation as to how a mistaken impression was given to this House, regrettable as it was at the time.</P>
      <P>Sir, may I make two points? First, we need to find a way &ndash; I would have thought that proposing to suspend Standing Orders of the House for the entire day was a pretty substantial motion but I accept your ruling &ndash; but some clarification may be required, although not here on the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, regarding the constitutional right of the fourth estate to observe us doing our business in public as required under the Constitution, while practice and precedent may have grown up in the past, that does not mean it is carved in stone or that we are the prisoners of it for the future or, indeed, for the present. For that reason, as I have asked previously, it is timely now that you, in your capacity as the Chairperson of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, would convene such a meeting to discuss these matters and other matters in order that we can avoid having extracted, prolonged and protracted debates here which, on occasions, bring us into conflict with you. I want to assure you that we have no <Col N="4" /> conflict with the Chair. The people opposite are the ones we are worried about, not you, Sir.</P>

      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31, dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Quinn and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Taoiseach to make a full statement on the circumstances of the resignation from office of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, the former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with special responsibility for food, the need in particular for the Taoiseach to respond to claims made by Deputy O'Keeffe that the Taoiseach reneged on a deal made to transfer him to another Department, the allegations that members of the Taoiseach's staff may have exerted improper pressure on Deputy O'Keeffe, and the need for the Taoiseach to explain why the role of food quality within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has now apparently been downgraded. Given the importance of the matter, I hope the Ceann Comhairle agrees to the request.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 5, Social Welfare Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 48, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 1, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m. Private Members' business shall be No. 108, motion re Road Safety (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I will not agree to the Order of Business unless I receive an undertaking from the Tánaiste that the Taoiseach will make a formal statement in the House on the Deputy Ned O'Keeffe affair and answer questions from the Opposition. In replying to my request, will the Tánaiste clarify something? Deputy O'Keeffe indicated last Friday that he would resign at 4 o'clock. At 5.30 p.m., someone on behalf of the Taoiseach briefed that the Taoiseach would take action on a case that had already been decided. The Tánaiste intervened in the late afternoon. At what point was she informed by the Taoiseach that Deputy O'Keeffe was resigning his position? We need to know that piece of information to establish whether the Tánaiste was misled or whether it was just the public who was misled.</P>

      <P>We would be more than happy to sit not just until 10 o'clock but until 12 o'clock to have this matter dealt with. Was the Tánaiste consulted on this decision to put pressure on the former Minister of State to resign after he had indicated on Friday that he would do so? Does she not regard her position as Tánaiste as one for which she has collective responsibility in Govern<Col N="6" /> ment and that she cannot therefore wash her hands of this matter as she tried to do on Friday?</P>

      <P>I am more than happy to speak as Deputies opposite know. I did not make any statement about this matter on Friday. Deputy O'Keeffe made the right decision to resign and I have already said that. Clearly the resignation of any individual from office is a difficult time for them and their families and we should respect that. I discussed this matter with the Taoiseach some time ago. I was not misled. The logistics of how the resignation came about are a matter for the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Keeffe and not for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I hope the Chair will forgive me for intervening but in the course of the crossfire before the division he made a statement that, in my view, would have serious consequences for the manner in which Deputies may raise points on the Order of Business, with particular reference to the late sitting. It would be most helpful if the Ceann Comhairle was to clarify matters because he made reference to a change in Standing Orders which, as I understand it, has no bearing on the point at issue. It is important that this matter be clarified by the Ceann Comhairle or his office at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

The sequence is that first there is a question from the Leader of Fine Gael, next there is a supplementary question on the same subject by the Leader of the Labour Party and there then follows a reply from the Taoiseach. Following this, there is a supplementary question by the Leader of Fine Gael and a final reply by the Taoiseach. That is then followed by a question from the Leader of the Labour Party, a supplementary question on that subject by the Leader of Fine Gael, a reply by the Taoiseach, a supplementary question from the Leader of the Labour Party and a final reply by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister for Education and Science doing to solve the teachers' strike? The Tánaiste will be aware that a new schedule of strike action was published this morning, including a threat to the summer examinations and an immediate threat to the oral and aural examinations. The Tánaiste is aware of the grave concern among teachers that they cannot get back to teaching in their classrooms, the concern among parents and, in particular, among students, especially leaving certificate students who see the examinations looming and are extremely concerned and stressed. It seems to us on this side of the House that there is no sense of urgency in the manner in which the Government is dealing with this issue. In particular, there is no sense of urgency in the manner in which the Minister is dealing with this issue. Can the Tánaiste clarify the Government's position and give some comfort to those students all around the country who are particularly stressed out as a result of the publication this morning of a schedule of further strike action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To add to what Deputy Noonan has said, would the Tánaiste address the issue of concern that parents have with respect to the probability that the examinations will not now take place and what action can the Government take <Col N="13" /> at this stage to ensure that there is a satisfactory resolution of this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of both Deputies in relation to the ongoing teachers' dispute. This matter is before the Labour Court and we should await its deliberations. I strongly recommend that everybody should seriously consider its recommendations. We have put in place in this State machinery to deal with industrial relations problems, and there is an onus on all of us to use and respect that machinery. I also know that nothing motivates parents more than the education of their children. The Minister for Education and Science said in this House on 1 February that the examinations will go ahead and that contingency arrangements are being made to ensure that the integrity of the examinations will not be interfered with. That remains a priority for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Tánaiste that it appears to the general public that the Minister for Education and Science has handled this in a most lethargic fashion. Were it not for his lassitude, this could have been solved prior to Christmas. Is the Government committed to accepting the Labour Court recommendation on this matter? Could the Tánaiste indicate when the Labour Court recommendation is expected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there has been inertia on the part of the Minister in relation to this matter but, as Deputy Noonan knows, having meddlesome Ministers in industrial relations disputes is never the answer either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not know when the Labour Court will make its recommendation but I hope it will be soon. The Government would give very serious consideration to a Labour Court recommendation. If a dispute is referred to that machinery of the State, that impartial forum, there is an onus on us all to take seriously any recommendations it makes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste will be aware that I wrote to the Taoiseach on 4 January expressing my concern over a conflict of interest in relation to a member of the Cabinet which has collective responsibility. I refer to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government bringing in legislation which is starting its passage in the other House this morning and which proposes to increase the amount of money that can be spent while, at the same time, as joint treasurer of Fianna Fáil, he has responsibility for collecting or counting money. I wrote to the Taoiseach on 4 <Col N="14" /> January bringing to his attention this conflict of interests which affects Cabinet collective responsibility. I have been assured by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions that I would get a reply from him. It is now 21 February and I have not received such a reply. Would the Tánaiste share my concern that the shyness of the Taoiseach indicates some unhappiness and discomfort on his part, that perhaps he does not have the degree of confidence in the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that he should, like his failure to express confidence in the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, on three separate occasions? Does she think it acceptable that the Taoiseach would not reply to a letter from the leader of a political party in Opposition in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <Col N="15" /> In relation to the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Quinn, this matter has been dealt with on the floor of this House on a number of occasions over the past few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 December last year this House voted in principle to limit donations to political parties in this State to people who are registered to vote in this State. We are against the proposal to which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government wants to give authority in his amending legislation to the 1997 Act whereby corporate donations of up to £20,000 per annum from individual corporate bodies could be legally accepted by political parties. Will the Tánaiste state very clearly, on behalf of all Progressive Democrats both inside this House and outside, that, notwithstanding any of the revelations in Dublin Castle or any of the facts&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no conflict in people holding positions in political parties and having a ministerial office. That includes leaders of parties who probably engaged in the past in more fund raising than anyone else. What is important is the integrity of the individual and the process.</P>

Seven wealthy individuals who happen to have a corporation can individually give money, or people in partnerships who are not incorporated, but a corporation cannot give even a third of what they can give. I do not see why there should be a distinction between the two. There are many issues here that need to be teased out. That is why we would like an all-party committee so that we could come to an agreement on these matters.</P>

      <P>In relation to the shambles of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, when will we see secondary legislation establishing a statutory authority to deal with education welfare?

      <P>I wish to ask about two matters. On yesterday's Order Paper, item 72 referred to a motion in the name of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, asking the Dáil to note UN human rights year, which extended from December 1997 to December 1998. Is it proposed to complete the discussion on that motion, which would enable the House to discuss the ratification of outstanding UN conventions, or is it proposed to withdraw the item from the Order Paper? Yesterday, the Taoiseach gave an undertaking that he would contact the Government Whip with regard to arranging time for a discussion on recent events in Iraq. Given that the Security Council is meeting today, will we have an opportunity tomorrow to discuss Ireland's attitude to the bombing of Iraq by the US and Britain&mdash;</P>

Is the Government serious about introducing an ombudsman for children and, if so, why has there been a delay of several years in this regard? It is clear from what is happening to children that the residential care services are in chaos. A social services inspectorate has been established but does the Government intend to put it on a statutory basis to co-ordinate what is happening with residential services for children and to increase the supports <Col N="17" /> for staff? Clearly, the staff believe they are not being sufficiently supported. Otherwise, children would not have to be put in hotels, bed and breakfasts and garda stations.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the four years since this Government came into office, Ireland has changed dramatically for the better. Unemployment has been cut to one of the lowest levels in Europe, taxes have been slashed so that our people keep much more of their hard earned money and we have put in place a framework for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have turned around our social welfare system from one that simply compensates people for economic failure to one that helps people to help themselves. The Government has massively increased spending on social welfare from £4.5 billion in 1997 to more than £6 billion in 2001 &ndash;  an increase of more than one third in just four years.</P>
      <P>Pension rates for our older people have been increased dramatically over the period. When we took up office in 1997, the old age (contributory) pension stood at £78 per week. We promised to raise it to £100 by 2002. We have more than delivered on that target as the Bill before the House provides for a pension rate of £106 today. We also promised to raise all social welfare pensions for older people to £100 per week by 2002. We are well on the way to delivering that target with the old age (non-contributory) pension rate of £95.50 provided for in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Under the previous Government, pension rates were allowed to fall back compared to average earnings. We put at end to that. When we came into office, the old age (contributory) pension stood at only 27.5% of average industrial earnings. We have increased that in each year to 31% in 2001, which is in line to reach the National Pensions Policy Initiative target of 34%.</P>
      <P>The level of child benefit will be more than doubled from only £30 per month in 1997, for the first two children, to £67.50 as set out in the Bill for 2001. We have promised that we will increase it further next year to more than £20 per week, which represents a threefold increase in the rate of payment over our term in office.</P>
      <P>The number of carers in receipt of a carers' allowance or benefit has almost doubled from 9,000 in 1997 to 17, 000 today. We have extended maternity and adoptive leave so that a mother can now take up to 26 weeks leave on the birth of a child, including 18 weeks paid leave. The Bill provides for the social welfare aspects of this important move. This improvement will come into force for women going on maternity leave on or after the 8 March next, which is International Women's Day.</P>

    <P>Because of our success in creating more than 300,000 new jobs and of getting people back to work, the live register has fallen more rapidly than anyone could have expected, with a reduction of more than 110,000 people. We now have one of the lowest unemployment rates in <Col N="23" /> Europe. There is more good news to come today from the quarterly national household survey.</P>
    <P>In 1997, we spent almost one pound in every four of total social welfare expenditure on employment and unemployment supports. Today, that is down to one pound in every seven. Whereas in 1997 most of that money was spent paying people to do nothing, more than 30% of current employment and unemployment spending goes to help people back to work and back to education.</P>
    <P>Not alone has unemployment fallen rapidly, but the overall number of people of working age who are dependent on welfare has also declined as a result of our policies. In 1997, one in every four people of working age was dependent on welfare. Today, despite the rapid growth in our economy and our population, that figure is down to less than one in every five.</P>
    <P>Because we have increased real spending and allowed many people of working age to be more independent of the welfare system, we have been able to increase spending significantly in key areas such as old age and retirement pensions, child support, carers and people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect to the biggest ever increases in social welfare rates of payment and to a wide range of other improvements announced in Budget 2001. It addresses commitments set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium aimed at building an inclusive society, improves the living standards of people on social welfare and fulfils our commitments under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The £850 million package provided by the Government in Budget 2001 for social welfare improvements is more than twice the size of last year's social welfare package and four times more than that delivered by the previous Government in its last budget in 1997. With increases ranging from 10% to 18%, people dependent on social welfare will see significant real increases in their incomes this year. The historic increases in child benefit represent the most concerted effort in the history of the State to tackle child poverty.</P>
    <P>I now wish to outline the provisions of the Bill and I will refer to a number of its key provisions. The Government's commitment to addressing the needs of the elderly both now and in the longer term is beyond question. It recognises the tremendous contribution the present generation of pensioners has made to the social and economic development of the State. In so doing they had to endure great hardship and make great sacrifices for which we owe them a great deal of gratitude. The increases provided for in sections 4 and 5 more than deliver on our commitments. In our period in government we have given pensioners increases of £5, £6, £7 and £10 per week compared to the insulting increases of between £1.50 and £3 given by the Rainbow Coalition.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a special increase in the rate of widow's and widower's contributory pen<Col N="24" /> sion and deserted wife's benefit for those aged over 66 years. This increase of £12.90 per week will bring the new rate to £102 per week and is a first step in bringing the rate into line with old age contributory pension. The Bill also introduces a special allowance of £10 per week for pensioners who reside on islands off the coast.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to substantial increases in other social welfare payments. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that &ldquo;substantial progress will be made over the period of this Programme towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates of social welfare&rdquo;. The personal rates of social welfare payments, other than those for older people, are being increased by £8 per week. This represents an increase of almost 10% and means that we are in line not only to make substantial progress, but to fully reach the £100 target. We are fully meeting our commitments under the PPF. I am delighted to say that the increases in the weekly payments will be paid from the first week in April and coincide with the implementation of the income tax changes.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have introduced a range of measures to make it easier for those, particularly women, who have taken time out for family reasons to qualify for old age pension. Work is continuing towards introducing a greater degree of flexibility in the qualifying conditions to improve the position of women. I am introducing special improvements to assist women at pension age and who may not benefit from these improvements. The Government has decided that the allowance for qualified adults over the age of 66 years should be increased in this and future budgets to the full old age non-contributory pension rate.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards this goal, I am providing in the Bill for special increases of £15 per week in the allowances payable to qualified adults over the age of 66 years whose spouses-partners are receiving a contributory pension with proportionate increases for those on reduced rates. In other words, a couple, each of whom is over the age of 66 years, in receipt of old age contributory pension and qualified adult allowance will get an extra £25 per week from this April.</P>
    <P>Increases ranging between £7 and £9 per week are also being provided in the rate of qualified adult allowances payable to those under the age of 66 years as a further step in increasing these allowances to 70% of the main rate. The increase in qualified adult allowance payable with old age non-contributory pension is £9 per week with proportionate increases for those on reduced rates.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is a universal payment made directly to families. As such it is the most efficient and effective way in which the Government can channel help to children. Before we took office expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. The increases announced in budget 2001, provided for in section 6 of the Bill, bring investment in 2001 to £761 million, almost double <Col N="25" /> the 1997 figure. The monthly rate for the first two children is being increased by £25 per month and the monthly rate for the third and subsequent child by £30 per month. These increases are greater than the sum of all increases provided in the past six budgets. The increases of £25 and £30 compare starkly with the £1 and £5 increase given by Deputy Quinn when Minister for Finance in the last Rainbow Coalition budget in 1997.</P>

      <P>Moreover this is only the first of three annual increases which will see an investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003, almost a threefold increase. By the end of this period the higher rate of child benefit will be £146 per month and the lower rate, £117.50. In 2003, a family with four children will receive approximately £527 per month child benefit or the equivalent of £120 per week. As a first step this year, the same family will receive £307 per month or £70 per week.</P>
      <P>These major increases will be payable to all families &ndash; those who choose to go out to work and who use paid child care, those with informal child care arrangements and those who choose to work in the home and care for the children in that way. The increases will be payable from June 2001, a full three months earlier than normal to over 500,000 families with over one million children. We will work towards bringing the increases back even earlier. This measure represents a substantial step on the way to meeting the child benefit commitment set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Section 7 increases the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement from May 2001 by £25 per week which will lead to a net gain of £15 per week in the average FIS payment for 15,000 families. Section 12 provides for the payment of four additional weeks of maternity and adoptive benefits. I will shortly introduce regulations to provide for an increase of £8 per week in the minimum amount and £10 in the maximum amount of benefit payable under these schemes, as well as providing for the award of credited contributions to those on maternity leave during unpaid periods of leave.</P>
      <P>Sections 8 and 9 provide for the implementation of a package of PRSI measures as announced in the budget. These include: a reduction of 0.5%, to 4%, in the main employee rate; an increase in the earnings ceiling for employees' PRSI contributions; the abolition of the employers' ceiling; a reduction of 2%, to 3%, in the rate of social insurance applicable to the self-employed, and the abolition of the annual earnings ceiling for the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Section 10 provides for an increase in the earnings ceiling for payment of optional contributions and section 11 provides for reductions in the rates of voluntary contributions. The abolition of the self-employed ceiling will yield £40 million in 2001 and £97 million in a full year, while the reduction of the standard rate of contribution payable from 5% to 3% will cost £37.5 million in 2001 and £87 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the employers' ceiling has given rise to some debate in recent weeks. Many commentators have argued that this measure will have a detrimental effect on employment. The Minister for Finance made it clear in his Budget Statement that the initiative regarding the employers' ceiling must be seen in the context of other measures which have provided, and will continue to provide, for substantial reductions in business taxation. It should also be seen in the context of reductions in the levels of PRSI payable by employers in recent years. For example, changes in corporation tax in the recent budget will benefit employers by £214 million in a full year &ndash; substantially more than the projected yield of £159 million from the employers' PRSI change.</P>
    <P>Irish social insurance levels are low when compared with our European partners. This will continue to be the case following the recently announced changes. For example, the combined employer and employee contribution payable in Ireland is lower at all income levels above £136 per week than its UK equivalent when compared on a pound for pound basis. It should be noted that there has been no employers' ceiling in the United Kingdom for many years and all benefits-in-kind are liable for an employer contribution.</P>
    <P>The valuable role of carers in society is irreplaceable. No other Government has been as committed to supporting carers as this one. We have delivered on a wide range of measures in terms of income support and services provided. However, we accept that we need to do more. In addition to the substantial rate increases, the budget provided for a number of measures to support carers. In particular, it made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. This will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for the carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment.</P>
    <P>This measure will be implemented by way of regulations. The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children who earn a joint income in the region of £15,100 will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance, while a couple in receipt of £25,100 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes, the respite care grant and the additional benefits. The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allow<Col N="27" /> ance. As I announced at budget time, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. The budget provided for a further enhancement of this payment by an increase in the amount of the grant from £300 to £400. In addition, carers who are caring for more than one care recipient will be entitled to a double respite care grant of £800. These increases will become effective in June 2001 when the grant is next due.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit scheme was introduced on 26 October last year and is specifically aimed at supporting people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has special responsibility for labour affairs, recently introduced the Carer's Leave Bill before the House to protect the employment rights of the carer. Section 25 of the Bill provides an easement of the qualifying conditions for the benefit to deal with situations where a carer is on leave from their employment in the three month period immediately prior to claiming the benefit. It is estimated that there could eventually be in the region of 6,800 people on carer's benefit, but it must be recognised that it will take some years before this scheme reaches maturity.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the removal of the limitation on income support payable to a couple on disability allowance, as announced in the budget. At present, the overall amount paid, where both of a married couple claim certain payments, may not exceed the personal rate plus the increase for the qualified adult. This measure will abolish the limitation of disability allowance with any other social welfare income support scheme. Some 1,000 people will benefit from this measure by between £17.30 and £31.50 per week this year.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the extension of the £6 living alone allowance to recipients of disability allowance, invalidity pension, unemployability supplement and blind person's pension, irrespective of age, with effect from April 2001. It is estimated that 10,000 recipients will qualify for the additional supplement. The overall increase for this group when account is taken of the general increase of £8 per week will be £14 per week.</P>
    <P>Section 13 introduces a number of improvements in the means test for social assistance payments: the disregard for the purposes of means assessment under any social assistance scheme of income received by a claimant by way of an allowance for the boarding out by a health board of frail elderly persons; the exemption of grants payable from the European Social Fund or under <Col N="28" /> VEC scholarship schemes; the extension of the sale of residence arrangements to recipients of disability allowance and blind pension and the disregard of meal and travelling allowances paid to unemployed persons and lone parents while participating in FÁS approved training courses in assessing their entitlement to unemployment assistance or one parent family payment.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for a change in the assessment of maintenance payments under the one parent family payment scheme. A disregard of up to £75 per week in respect of housing costs is currently applied to maintenance payments received by the lone parent and the balance is assessed as means. This section improves the position by providing that the balance of any maintenance payments over and above that allowed for housing costs will be assessed at 50%. The proposal is one of many recommendations contained in a review of the scheme which I published last September. It provided a valuable insight into the operation of the scheme and will form the basis for consideration of its future direction. This proposal has many advantages. It means that lone parents will make clear gains from any maintenance they receive. It is hoped that this change will also act as an incentive for the other parent to pay maintenance as their children will benefit directly from any support offered.</P>
    <P>I am also implementing a further recommendation of the review relating to the payment of the special transitional payment which is currently payable if the lone parent's income or earnings from employment exceeds £230.76 per week. The review recommended that lone parents should be in receipt of payment for 12 months to qualify for a transitional payment. This is provided for in section 20 and will ensure that the measure benefits those for whom it was intended, namely, long-term recipients moving to employment.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the recovery from a financial institution of amounts of pension or benefit paid by way of electronic fund transfer to the recipient's account for any period after his or her death. At present 40,000 pensioners choose to receive their pension by the EFT method of payment. This involves payment of their weekly pension directly into their bank or building society account. However, in many cases the Department and the financial institution may not become aware of the pensioner's death for some time and payments can continue to be lodged to his or her account after the date of death. While such moneys are recoverable, difficulties arise in recovering the overpaid amount. This proposal allows the Department to recoup such amounts directly from the recipient's accounts in the financial institutions involved.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government decided that the time was opportune to align the income tax year with the calendar year with effect from 1 January 2002. This will pay dividends in future years in a more rational tax and PRSI system which is in line with the tax systems in most EU and OECD countries. I am pleased that the Government <Col N="29" /> agreed that the weekly social welfare rates would also be increased in 2002, with effect from the first week in January. This is being done at a substantial extra cost of £85 million. When this Government came to office, the increases in social welfare were delivered in the last week in June and the first week in July. As of the next budget at the end of this year, we will bring back the dates of payment of the increases from the first week in July to the first week in January.</P>

      <P>I suggest to Deputy Broughan that his party did likewise on all the occasions it was in Government.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the introduction of the calendar basis tax year, the next tax year will be a short tax year running from 6 April to 31 December 2001. I am providing in Part 5 of the Bill for transitional measures to ensure that PRSI based social insurance entitlements earned during the short tax year are fully protected. This will mean that every person who has paid PRSI contributions in this period will have 14 additional paid contributions added to their PRSI record. This will ensure that no one will be disadvantaged as a consequence of the once-off transitional year. Equally, no one will pay more PRSI than they normally do in a calendar year.</P>
      <P>Part 6 of the Bill deals with the implementation of the Government's plans for the changeover to the euro within the social welfare code. Members will be familiar with the background to these measures.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the changeover to the euro is carried out fairly and with no advantage being sought from the changeover. Accordingly, in changing the rates of social welfare payments to convenient euro amounts, they will in all cases be rounded up to the nearest ten cents. Equally, PRSI rates have been rounded to the nearest euro in such a way as to favour the citizen. The Bill also provides for other convenient money amounts in the structure of weekly payments, such as means banding, in order to ensure rounded amounts. I assure the House that my Department will be undertaking an extensive information campaign aimed at ensuring that all social welfare recipients are fully aware of the general effects of the changeover to the euro and also the effects for their own payment. The increases will take effect from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>In just over a decade, Fianna Fáil in Government has turned around the economy. We have gone from high tax, high unemployment and low growth to a nation with low taxes, sustained economic growth and effectively full employment. That is our record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In four short years, we have turned around our social welfare system from one that simply compensates people for economic failure to one that helps people to help themselves. It is a system <Col N="30" /> that helps people who can work to get work and which supports our older people, our children, carers and people with disabilities. Equally, over the past four years we have endeavoured to streamline the taxation system. I would wager a bet that after the next budget people will see that the marrying of the social welfare and tax systems will have been done in such a way that both systems will be more clearly understood and easily accessed by the general public.</P>

When people look at the way in which we have done away with many of the rate bands, and have rationalised many of the complexities of the social welfare code, they will say the Government has done some service to the people.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to looking after the needs of our children, older people, carers and others who are dependent on our social welfare system. It will ensure that the resources of this unprecedented social welfare package of £850 million in a full year will be directed at those who are most in need.</P>

In my time as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs over the past four years, the facts speak for themselves. Anyone conducting an objective examination of the social welfare or taxation systems from the time when Deputy Broughan's party was in Government to the present, would see that we gave £5 to old age pensioners in our first budget, followed by increases of £6, £7 and £10 in the succeeding budgets. In the budgets introduced by the previous Government, increases of £1.50, £1.80 <Col N="31" /> and £3 were given to old age pensioners. The facts speak for themselves and I rest my case.</P>

      <P>Taking child benefit, for example, in this budget we are giving £25 per month each for the first two children, and £30 for the third. In the previous Government's last budget, the corresponding sums were £1 and £5. The facts speak for themselves. Everything that I have had to do with the social welfare code says enough. One only has to take the issue of marriage counselling where for three years, from 1994-97, voluntary groups received only £900,000, whereas that sum has risen by 500% in the past four years. Before taking office we committed ourselves to providing a nation-wide family mediation service. In 1997 there were only two mediation centres, one in Limerick and the other in Dublin. There are now 11 such centres and the service is to be placed on a statutory basis. The financial resources for that service have risen by 400%.</P>
      <P>The budget for the National Social Services Board, which is under the aegis of my Department, has increased by approximately 150%. Across the board there have been huge improvements. The public should look objectively at the facts and figures, comparing our record in Government to that of the previous Administration. Any objective analysis will show that we have done a good job.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear from his contribution that he is gearing up for an election. He seems to lay virtue on the fact that this year, as a consequence of this Bill, he will spend about £850 million compared to the sum of £200 million that was spent by my party and Deputy Broughan's party when last we were in office in 1997. While that is true, it is only telling part of the story. The Minister has not mentioned the exceptional cash surpluses that exist in our economy today, compared to the 1997 surplus. Let us put them on the record, as the Minister has challenged both Deputy Broughan and myself in respect of our records. In 1997, the budget surplus was £374 million. Five years later, as a consequence of the exceptional management of the economy from 1994-97, which his party&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tends to have a jack-in-the-box reaction every so often, but I did not interrupt him so he should listen to some of the facts before replying in due course. Today's budget surplus is somewhat different to that of 1997, and the Minister well knows that. Let us put the figures on the record so that the public will know how much we are awash with cash at the moment. Some £3.9 billion exists as a result of the exceptional management of the economy by a number of Governments. Nearly £4 billion is within the remit of the Government this year to make clear priority choices in respect of spending. One does not have to be a mathematical genius to work out that if one compares the sums of £200 million and £850 million with the 1997 and current budget surpluses, the percentage spend is going down. The Government does not like to hear much about that, however, because it underlines the gross inequalities that exist within our society.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the Government and the Minister have tinkered with the system but have not produced the kind of sustained increases and structural reform in social welfare about which I will speak on another occasion. In 1997, we had £374 million, but four years later the Minister has £3,900 million. The provisions of the Bill should be seen against the fantastic management of the economy by a number of Governments. I would be the first to concede that.</P>
      <P>Few can disagree that Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the European Union. Our position, relative to other countries, has changed dramatically over the past ten years and we now have an unprecedented opportunity to genuinely share the wealth that has been produced in this economy. All parties which have served in government in recent times should be justifiably proud of their record in helping to transform the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The undeniable success of recent years should not blind us to the fact that poverty is still a reality for hundreds of thousands. Those who <Col N="33" /> have put forward the fatalistic notion that the poor will always be with us must be challenged by policies that can effect real income distribution. In the budgets presented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy it is undeniable that we have seen the gap widen between those on high and low incomes.</P>
    <P>Despite the cynicism about the political process, we can all point to many successful policies established by politicians in recent years. The advances made in Northern Ireland since the passage of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 have their origins in politics. The recent transformation of the economy and the increased availability of resources also have their origins in politics. There is a need to set a new national objective to completely eradicate poverty in the next five years. It is possible to do this, given the resources available. All that is needed is the political will to make it happen, but this is lacking as a consequence of the Government's actions.</P>
    <P>With our new found wealth, can it be said that a concerted effort has been made to tackle deprivation and genuinely alleviate social inequality? The answer is no. Those who live on small incomes do not register on the Government's priority list. It is clear that under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government &ndash; this Bill is no different from the preceding three &ndash; the gap between rich and poor is widening. There are too many cases of poverty in the community. This can be set against a political backdrop where the principle of greed is good rules the policy agenda.</P>
    <P>When one considers the attack made on single parents by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, in 1997 and the frequent disparaging remarks made by the Minister for Finance who has referred to &ldquo;the poverty industry&rdquo;, one recognises the prejudice against those on low incomes at the highest level of Government. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Government has produced budgets and social welfare provisions that are unable to deliver genuine improvements to low income families. One should not be mistaken, this a deliberate political objective of the Government. Such bias against those on low incomes can be resolved only by a change of Government.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is opposed to the paltry increases proposed in the Bill. We will, therefore, vote against the Bill on Second Stage because, as constituted, it will further marginalise those on low incomes. It also runs against the spirit of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the provisions of the Bill cannot change the fact that more than 20% of the population are living below the 50% poverty line outlined in the national anti-poverty strategy. The Bill will do nothing to improve Ireland's standing internationally as a country which has one of the highest rates of poverty in the western world. The United Nations development programme index rates Ireland seventeenth out of 18 countries in respect of income inequality. The situation will worsen this year as the proposed payments set <Col N="34" /> out in the Bill do not meet GNP growth rates within the wider economy.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the successful management of the economy by the rainbow Government, since it took office in 1997 the Government has failed to tackle evident income disparities despite the fact that remarkable income returns afford the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs an unprecedented opportunity to make a radical shift in income distribution.</P>
    <P>In speaking to the financial resolution in December, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs spoke of his cherished republican principles, which he believed were the touch stones of the budget. That brand of republicanism expressed by the Fianna Fáil Party since it ditched its former leader, the late Jack Lynch, in 1979, has little to do with the principles of fairness and justice in respect of income distribution. The Minister boasted recently about the £214 million he has managed to claw back from fraudulent claims on the social welfare system. Fianna Fáil knows an awful lot about fraud given the number of politicians from that party who have attempted to avoid paying their fair share of tax in the past 20 years, since the lamented departure of the late Mr. Lynch. Last December's lecture on his party's new found interest in the republican ideal is difficult to stomach given the scandals being exposed in another place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister made that comment in response to a financial resolution in December which provided for the implementation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The measures outlined in the Bill will do nothing to lift families out of poverty. They are more of the same. Given the Minister's difficulty, the tiny improvements in social welfare payments when set against a budget surplus of £3,900 million highlight the mean spirited and fundamentally conservative approach of the Government. Those at the top of the income scale received a windfall following changes in capital and personal taxation while those at the bottom have to be content with a miserable increase of £8 per week in their basic welfare payment. It is the case that all the children of the nation are not being treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PPF contains a clear commitment that over the lifetime of the programme the £100 target in respect of the basic social welfare payment will be achieved. Fine Gael considers that the £8 increase set out in the Bill does not meet this target. Provision was made in the PPF for an acceleration of progress towards the £100 target in the event that economic growth generated additional <Col N="35" /> resources. Additional resources have been generated. I, therefore, put it to the Minister and other Members that the £100 target is no longer realistic given our new found wealth since the signing of the PPF. What is the reason for the distinction in the Bill between the £8 increase for non-elderly recipients and the £10 increase in old age pension? It seems the Minister is trying to make a distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor. The House should receive an explanation for this distinction before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will oppose the Bill as it does not meet the objectives set in our pre-budget social welfare proposals last November. The provisions in social welfare announcements that stemmed from the financial statement by the Minister for Finance last December will not adequately compensate social welfare recipients for the effects of inflation in the latter part of 2000. While the increase in child benefit is welcome, it will in no way meet the substantial costs associated with child welfare. Given the considerable number of carers in society, it is disgraceful that the minor changes proposed will affect only a tiny proportion of the total number. There seems to be no consideration of the effects of poverty on women, specifically single parents who are struggling to make ends meet. Despite the much publicised £10 increase in old age pension, the position of the elderly in society has not advanced given the astonishing level of resources at the disposal of the Government.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the measures outlined in the Bill tinker with the problem of income distribution and offer only crumbs from the table of the Celtic tiger. If this is all the Government can offer in good days, I would hate to see it having to make social welfare choices in bad days. Those of us with long memories will recall the McCreevy dirty dozen and their penetrating affect on the poor only ten years ago. Ensuring that social welfare payments are higher than the annual rate of inflation is only one way to effectively ensure that there has been an increase in real income. A much more sensible way to deliver real increases for people who require social welfare payments would be to set the rate of increase to exceed the estimated GNP growth within the economy. Such a provision is part of the PPF. When growth increases, targets should increase too. The £100 target, which the Minister lectured us about, is no longer realistic given the new wealth and exceptional GNP growth since the PPF was first negotiated and signed.</P>
    <P>Last November Fine Gael proposed an across the board increase of between £10 and £14 per week for all basic social insurance and social assistance payments. We regarded these figures as the bare minimum if we are to reverse the damage in the Social Welfare Act, 2000. That legislation, allied to the Finance Act, 2000, saw real cuts in monetary terms for the poorest and most vulnerable. The proposals in the Bill under <Col N="36" /> discussion to improve social welfare payments are unacceptable given the surplus which exists.</P>
    <P>The problem of child poverty here has been highlighted for a considerable period of time. It is estimated that Irish children have the highest income poverty level of any EU country. Recent research shows that 25% of children live in households earning less than half the average income. Children are 1.24 times more likely to be in poverty than adults. As part of our submission last November, we encouraged the Government to develop a range of anti-poverty measures to be included in this year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>It is therefore hugely disappointing that despite the provisions of Sections 6 and 7, there are very few initiatives in this Bill which could genuinely be described as addressing the issue of child poverty. After three years of refusing to significantly improve child benefit, the Minister has finally decided to move in the direction that Fine Gael first proposed in 1998. This movement is welcome, although late, but should be more substantial and should have reached the £100 per month per child target in the recent budget. I agree with the Minister that the most effective way to help children and families in poverty is to dramatically increase child benefit. This approach will provide families with real child care alternatives and allow them to take up additional employment opportunities. The Government's halfway house approach stems from its failure to recognise the importance of child benefit over the past three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because they can be answered and thereby expose the inadequacies of the Government in this area. Fine Gael has called for additional resources to be granted to health boards for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. The number of children benefiting from this allowance has fallen in the past year. The allowance was paid to 183,708 children in 1999.</P>
      <P>We also believe that an improved free school meal scheme should be extended. The increase in funding provided by the Minister is welcome but the existing scheme is insufficient given the need that currently exists. In this day and age, to boast that only 2,000 children can avail of this scheme out of a total school population of 824,000 children is pathetic in the extreme. Ireland is one of the last EU countries to put in place a free school meal scheme, particularly for disadvantaged children, and the Minister is responsible for that.</P>
      <P>There are some welcome improvements in the limits for family income supplements. Child care costs, however, should have been disregarded in the full assessment of FIS. Fine Gael proposed the introduction of a £10 per week capitation payment for child care.</P>
      <P>Once again the Government has reneged on its commitments to substantially improve the conditions for carers. Of the estimated 50,000 carers in Ireland, figures supplied by the Department itself, a few more than 14,000 are eligible to receive the carer's allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply tinkering with the existing allowances for carers, as the Minister has done, will not improve the position of a group who are providing care and assistance for thousands of people. Unfortunately, we have not seen any measures in this Bill to radically help their position. In November we proposed a £100 per month care payment for qualified carers to offset the additional costs of caring for a person in the home. We did not see any movement in relaxing the means test to allow additional people claim the carers allowance. Fine Gael has publicly called for doubling of the respite grant to £600, as against the Minister's proposal of £400 in this Bill. Equally, recipients of the carers allowance should keep other allowances to which they would be entitled if they were not in receipt of the carers allowance.</P>
      <P>We need to improve the position of pensioners. Ireland will witness a 50% increase in the population over retirement age from 400,000 in 1994 to 700,000 in 2020. It is estimated that 80% of elderly people living alone in Ireland are reliant on social welfare payments. Not only should we dramatically improve the direct level of income support, but we should develop community based support programmes so that older people can remain independent in the community. The vast majority of people cannot understand how older people can survive on such small incomes.</P>
      <P>An effort was not made in this budget to bring the non-contributory pension up to the level of the contributory pension. It is ludicrous that a monetary distinction should exist between both pensions schemes. I am also critical of the minor changes to the living alone allowance which will help recipients of disability allowance, invalidity pension, unemployment supplement and the blind person's pension, but will exclude widows and widowers and other groups who live alone and need support. Will the living at home allowance be extended to persons who take advantage of the new scheme in the Finance Bill and take in a tenant at a rent of up to £6,000 per annum before declaring for tax? Will the living alone allowance for elderly people still be available to them if they take in a student or a single person? That is an innovative proposal in the Finance Bill. Will those who take in tenants still receive the living alone allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There needs to be a radical rethink about the pensions policy. Given the need to retain people in the workforce, a more flexible approach is needed. There should be no financial barriers to people over 66 remaining in the workforce. Where people have been contributing to a pension scheme for years, they should be entitled to the pension even if they work outside the home <Col N="39" /> after the official retirement age. There is a need to provide high support facilities within the community for the elderly. There are excellent examples of local authorities developing senior citizens' complexes with imagination and skill. These should be the norm.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to abolish the ceiling on employers' PRSI. This was outlined first in December 2000. This measure will create additional difficulty in recruiting high skilled people. The Government ought to rethink this proposal. Removing the existing £36,600 ceiling means employers will have to foot the bill at the 12% rate for all salaries. This will increase the cost of high salaried, value added employment which, in turn, will have an adverse effect on employment investment. There are dangers threatening the US manufacturing base and consequent dangers for employment here. It would be prudent to tread carefully now. There are too many recent examples of job losses in the high-tech sector. It is becoming more difficult to employ high skilled people in the current labour situation. The removal of the PRSI ceiling is bad for business, future employment and competition. This was a sudden proposal and should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>We oppose the Bill because it is inadequate given our economic resources. It does not address income inequalities which have been highlighted yearly by the Government's taxation policies, obsessed with cutting rates rather than increasing allowances or introducing genuine tax reform. Our party wants to eradicate poverty and we now have an opportunity to do that. This Bill will make no difference to low income families in a cycle of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister tried to introduce anti-inflationary measures to protect low income families, but he was shot down by his Cabinet colleagues. He was told to wait and still there is no compensation for people on low income suffering because of inflation since last August. The proposals in this Bill will not outstrip inflation, which they must do&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Two months ago when the Minister, Deputy Ahern, concluded his speech on budget 2001, he said, &ldquo;The budget is about empowerment. This budget is about social inclusion. This budget is <Col N="40" /> about spreading the wealth and supporting the weak. This budget is about republicanism&rdquo;. Almost the direct opposite is the case. The Bill, and the budget on which it is based, are not about empowering our most deprived citizens and communities. They strengthened the social exclusion of tens of thousands of our most vulnerable citizens, especially those with disabilities, carers, pensioners and their dependants, young working parents and the long-term unemployed. Neither the budget nor the Bill is about republicanism, unless it was of the George W. Bush variety. Republicanism in early America and France stressed equality above all political virtues. With liberty and fraternity, it was a philosophic cornerstone of the French Revolution which continues to inspire political thought after more than two centuries. By this republican measure, this Minister is a hopeless failure and the Government is a right-wing greedy cabal. After almost four years of existence, the key impact of this Fianna Fáil-PD Government has been the widening of the gap between the rich and poor. Every time the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Taoiseach had to choose between improving conditions for the most disadvantaged in our society and expanding the income and opportunities of the richest, they chose their rich friends. The judgment of the CORI Justice Commission on this Government is devastating. It states:</P>
    <P>The poorest people in Irish Society have been betrayed by Budget 2001. With sufficient resources available to enable it to eliminate income poverty among both adults and children, Government chose instead to give these resources in superabundance to those who were already better off. As a result, this Government's legacy after four budgets is to have substantially widened the rich/poor gap &ndash; which was already the worst in the E.U.</P>
    <P>CORI concluded that &ldquo;when political leadership was required so that everyone would benefit from the country's new-found prosperity and be treated with fairness, this government chose, instead, to refuse to hear the cry of the poor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The cold statistics bear out this grim analysis. Total State expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of gross national product has declined from 9.9% in 1997, to 9.1 % in 1998, to 8.4% in 1999, to 7.9% in 2000 and finally to perhaps 7.5% this year.</P>

      <P>The 5.2% to 5.25% average increase in social welfare rates given from May 2000 was seriously eroded by the explosion in inflation and, for many categories of recipients, any benefits from budget 2000 were easily wiped out.</P>

      <P>The Minister should listen. As inflation gathered speed last September, I raised the alarm on behalf of social welfare recipients at the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. The Minister belatedly came to the committee and gave us a litany of vague and, as it transpired, worthless assurances. The Labour Party asked that budget 2001 increases be introduced from 1 January this year as a basic gesture of compensation for the ravages of inflation. The Minister steadfastly refused and hence the dates in sections 4 and 5.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Ahern, was well aware of the failure of the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to improve the living standards of our poorest people. This was clearly shown in the extraordinary saga, or perhaps farce, of the £74 million inflation compensation package which the Minister's friends in the media published just before the budget. Apparently the Minister asked the Cabinet for this £74 million, but he was shot down as the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, waved him away with disdain.</P>

      <P>That sorry tale clearly indicates that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, fully realised that inflation had wrecked his 2000-01 social welfare budget.

      <P>A Minister who took serious responsibility for families on social welfare would have told the Cabinet to produce more money or else. However, sadly, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is not such a Minister.</P>
      <P>Inflation continues to increase to 5.2% at present, although the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, estimates it will average 4.5% for 2001. However, after last year, who can believe him? The Minister for Finance's own figures show net current spending increasing to 6.6% for the coming year and this suggests a higher inflation rate than his budget estimate. Once again, in the final roller coaster year of entry to the euro, social welfare incomes may be seriously eroded or even wiped out as during 2000. Therefore, in a similar attempt to last year, the Labour Party will try to amend Part 2 of the Social Welfare Bill to allow monitoring of the effects of inflation on the rates of periodical benefits and social assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had heeded the advice of the Labour Party and many representative bodies for citizens on social welfare benefits, the Social Wel<Col N="43" /> fare Bill, 2001, would have been passed last autumn and the increases would have come into effect from 1 January this year. As he failed to introduce this inflation compensatory measure, the Minister is now faced with a double whammy for January 2002, assuming he is still the Minister. As Part 6 of the 2001 Bill outlines, the increases for 2002 in social insurance and assistance will have to be introduced between 27 December 2001 and 4 January 2002. According to a memorandum released under the Freedom of Information Act, the Minister's senior staff think this timetable may be impossible unless budget 2002 is early.</P>

      <P>Throughout the consultation period before this year's budget, the Government was strongly urged to aim at a general rise in social welfare rates of £14 per week by a variety of representative groups, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed. It was felt that such a rise would help to compensate for rising inflation. Contributors to the pre-budget debate believed that under no circumstances should the general rise be less than £10 per week. Since the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness set a target of £100 per week for the lowest social welfare payments, there was a strong effort by the voluntary and community pillar of national partnership to persuade the Government to achieve the £14 per week increase as a major step to the £100 benchmark. Regrettably, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, and his colleagues disregarded these pleas and the resulting basic increase is only £8 a week under Schedules A and B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the overall context of the economic performance to which I referred, the rate of increases from April 2001 remain woefully disappointing. We should reflect on a sample of these rates. For recipients of unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, disability allowance, farm assist, blind pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension and the one parent family <Col N="44" /> payment, the weekly rate is £85.50. This represents 25% of average industrial earnings at 1999 levels. The carer's allowance weekly rate of £88.50 is dismal. For the fourth year running, the Government has failed to achieve its modest £100 target for senior citizens since non-contributory old age pension reaches a weekly rate of only £95.50 in April next.</P>
    <P>This is the ninth year I have voiced similar misgivings about the abysmal levels of social welfare income. That is why, although belatedly and towards the end of his administration, I welcome the fact that the Minister has at last appointed a committee under Professor Kieran Kennedy to study the benchmarking of social welfare incomes. The issue of the levels of weekly rates is the most crucial challenge facing a society which aspires to equality or, in the terms in which I began my contribution, to being a true Republic. In the coming weeks, the Labour Party will bring forward its proposals with regard to basic social welfare income which will be related to income in the general economy rather than to inflation or to some spurious benchmark plucked, like the Minister's pensioners' benchmark, from thin air.</P>
    <P>The blanket refusal of the Government to individualise social welfare benefits contrasts starkly with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's grim determination to introduce full tax individualisation. Last year's budget made a commitment to increase the qualified adult payment rate to 70% of the personal rate over three years. Given our economic progress, this extended implementation period was unnecessary and the target could have been achieved this year. The decision to gradually bring the qualified adult rate for the old age pension up to the level of the non-contributory rate is welcome. However, across the other social welfare rates, the £7 qualified adult increase is inadequate and continues to treat women in poverty as second class citizens. The qualified adult rate of £54 for dependants of claimants on social assistance and for a wide range of social insurance payments, including disability and unemployment benefits, is an appalling and insulting allowance on which to expect an adult citizen to live. By my calculations, the Minister should have moved to a minimum 70% rate or about £60 a week with the intention to introduce full individualisation as soon as possible. Section 26 flies in the face of any move towards individualisation.</P>
    <P>Section 16 removes the limitation on couples in receipt of disability allowance. The limitation means that when both individuals in a couple satisfy the eligibility conditions for a payment, they do not receive two full rates of payment. In the welcome development to which I referred, the Bill signifies the first phase of increases which will raise qualified adult pensions to the level of the personal rate for the old age non-contributory pension. However, the obvious omission from these improvements is unemployed people. Most qualified adults are women. A mother whose partner is unemployed, is genuinely and actively seeking work, passes the means test and makes <Col N="45" /> appropriate child minding arrangements is still denied the same rate of unemployment compensation as her partner. The Labour Party intends to table an amendment to this section.</P>
    <P>The much vaunted mantra of the Government to provide pensions of £100 a week is at last contained in the Bill after four budgets. However, as I noted, the non-contributory pension has still reached only £95.50. The long-standing demand of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' Retired Workers Group and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament was for State pensions equal to 34% of average industrial earnings. There is widespread evidence throughout our society of the serious poverty endured by many senior citizens and other pensioners. Last week, the Dáil received a disturbing report about the dreadfully poor housing conditions of senior citizens from the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, as usual from this smug and careless Administration, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has made no effort to find out the real extent of poverty among our senior population.</P>
    <P>Even with the limited resources available to us in Opposition, the Labour Party has long held the view that the issue of poverty among the elderly and others on fixed incomes should be addressed. This is why we said before Christmas that we would increase all long-term pensions by £24 a week if we were returned to Government after the next general election, bringing the old age contributory pension up to £120 per week. As a fundamental gesture to the people who created the economic boom that we are currently enjoying and who paid their high taxes in bad times, the Labour Party is committed to backdating the rise to £120 a week from 1 January 2001 whenever the party gets an opportunity to implement it. This will be a <i>sine qua non</i> of any Labour Party participation in Government. There are distinct differences between the Labour Party and the two major parties in the House. The Labour Party strongly supports the lifting of the ceiling on employers' contributions and we support the Government in that regard.</P>

      <P>The £25 and £30 increases in child benefit are welcome and mean that the objective of £100 per month for child benefit, to which the Government signed up in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will be met within the lifetime of the programme. The Labour Party agrees with the PPF that child benefit is a key mechanism to reduce levels of child poverty and to provide child income support. However, we fundamentally reject the Government's approach in pretending to address the issue of child care through child benefit alone, which is an anti-poverty income tool in a nation <Col N="46" /> with one of the worst rates of child poverty in the EU and OECD.</P>
      <P>On the issue of child care, apart from investment in provision, the Labour Party supported an additional parental child care payment with a £20 weekly rate for the under fives. Section 6 which moves forward the payment date for the increases in child benefit to 1 June this year is welcome, though many constituents will ask why the increases in child benefit could not have been aligned this year with all other increases.</P>
      <P>Before the introduction of Budget 2001, many commentators on poverty directed their attention to the level of child dependant allowances. Agencies such as the Combat Poverty Agency felt the national priority should be to target additional resources at households most in need and advocated an increase in child dependant allowances to £16 a week for children under 12 and £19 a week for children over that age. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul also urged that child dependant allowances be increased to £18 per week per child at a cost of £41 million. Schedules A and B in this Bill ignore these constructive proposals and the child dependant rate remains at £13.20 per week for most categories of social assistance and social insurance recipients.</P>
      <P>The improvement, in section 20, which deals with one parent family payment &ndash; transitional arrangements and assessment of maintenance payments &ndash; is an important step forward. The assessment of the 50% over £75 per week will be a valuable extra resource for lone parents and an encouragement for separated fathers to discharge their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Section 12 will allow for a major improvement in family life in the extension of maternity benefit from 14 to 18 weeks and of benefit for adoptive parents, from 10 to 14 weeks. Regulations have already been laid before the House by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995. I understand that under the provisions of both sets of regulations the extended period of maternity and adoptive leave will only apply to people who give their employers four weeks notice of their intention to take the extended leave following the approval of the new regulations. We are now operating within the four week period leading to 8 March to coincide with the extension of maternity benefit and adoptive benefit. Many women who will be on maternity benefit and on leave before 8 March however, will lose out on these extensions. Will the Minister examine section 12(2), (3) and (4) to see if there is any way in which we can facilitate mothers and adoptive mothers and parents already in the leave period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the respite care grant from £300 to £400 a year in section 14 is disappointing, given the expectation among carers that the grant might be doubled. The Labour Party is committed to a respite care grant of £1,000 a year and I will seek to amend this section on Committee Stage. In the <Col N="47" /> recent debate on Second Stage of the Carers Leave Bill, 2000, I outlined the total disillusionment of carers with the Government and the Minister. In our Constitution and our legislation there is no recognition of the invaluable role of carers. For tens of thousands of our fellow citizens, caring for a child or adult with a disability, as carers rightly say, is a seven day a week, 24 hours a day responsibility. Yet there is no sign of the Government showing any interest in the development of a long-term policy on caring in the community.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance, published in 1998, estimated the number of full-time carers at around 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. The leading national advocate of carers, the Carers Association, estimated in its October 2000 pre-budget submission that there were at least 120,000 family carers in the State, as Deputy Hayes noted earlier. At the end of 2000, however, there were only 16,302 recipients of carer's allowance. I am glad the Minister now tells us it has reached 17,000.</P>
    <P>It was then calculated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that the budget 2001 increases in the income disregards for carers, to £150 for a single carer and £250 for a joint income couple, would result in up to 5,000 additional carers qualifying for payment and 2,800 existing carers receiving an increased payment. Even with the introduction of carer's leave and carer's benefit, it is obvious that well more than half of carers, in the most narrow departmental definition of the term, are still excluded from State financial support.</P>
    <P>The continuous struggle of carers is visible throughout our society and the Government and the Minister have given scant regard to the reforms which are now urgently necessary. Most of all, carers are deeply resentful of the means test which excludes many thousands of carers from receipt of the carer's allowance. The Labour Party strongly supports the fundamental reform of carer's allowance into a continual care payment which will not be paid on the basis of financial means of relatives but on the basis of the caring needs of those being cared for. This was the correct conclusion of the 1996 Oireachtas report, A Long-Term Support Framework For Female Carers, prepared by Mel Cousins, which advocated awarding the allowance to carers of all persons requiring full-time care. As I said in this House two weeks ago during the debate on the Carers Leave Bill, 2000, it is past time that we abandoned the current Government's poor law approach to carers and abolished this rotten and inhumane means test.</P>
    <P>The reference to carer's benefit in section 18 reminds us of the unbelievable lethargy of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in introducing carer's leave and <Col N="48" /> carer's benefit. Throughout last year, Deputy Ahern trumpeted the start of carer's benefit although he knew that few citizens could afford to avail of the new benefit since the carer's leave legislation was not introduced and only appeared before the Dáil two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that only 11 people had been approved for carer's benefit by mid-December 2000 and that there were only just over 200 applications up to a few weeks ago when we discussed the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000?</P>
    <P>In recent months I have been contacted by a number of carers who took caring leave at their own expense in recent years to look after sick relatives and who are now denied the opportunity to participate in official carer's leave with the consequent carer's benefit. I hope to amend section 25 to cover those citizens and I ask the Minister today to bring forward proposals for a retrospective award of carer's benefit.</P>
    <P>Fuel poverty is a constant harsh reality of life for tens of thousands of our most deprived citizens. The extension of the heating system by three weeks &ndash; would it were by three months &ndash; from early October to late April is welcome, but many of our elderly constituents want to know why the £5 and £8 rates have remained unchanged for more than a decade, since 1985.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me in November last that the cost of doubling the standard allowance from £5 to £10 a week would cost an extra £37.25 million per fuel season. The review of the national smokeless fuel schemes by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in 1998 concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary weekly payments fully compensated recipients for all price inflation including the cost of fuel. Yet nobody doubts that social welfare increases barely kept pace with inflation last year or that there has been a significant rise in fuel costs since the mid-1980s when the free fuel scheme began. The Senior Citizens' Parliament estimates the basic rise, despite falls in oil prices and so on, has been of the order of 30%.</P>
    <P>There is the additional problem that many elderly people need assistance with heating costs throughout the whole year, as they need to keep warm. The new 29 week heating scheme is, therefore, welcome, but it does not meet the needs of many senior citizens and invalids. Perhaps we could examine that again in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Nobody will deny that some progress has been made under the national anti-poverty strategy and against the background of our remarkable economic growth, halving the numbers of people in consistent poverty is a welcome development. However, the ESRI report, Monitoring Poverty Trends, showed that, in 1998, relative poverty was increasing under the socially divisive fiscal and social policies of the Government. The 1998 survey showed that the percentage of persons below the 50% relative income poverty line was higher than a year previously with approximately one in <Col N="49" /> five people falling below this line. The rate of income poverty remains a challenge which the Government has failed to address in any coherent way and certainly not in the Social Welfare Bill, 2001.</P>
    <P>One key aspect of poverty and social exclusion which should be central to the NAPS and to the work of the Combat Poverty Agency is the spatial dimension. The spatial aspect of rural and urban poverty is striking and profound yet none of our policy makers seem to be interested in constructing maps of disadvantage based on obvious research. Where, for example, is the equivalent of the spatial health and mortality statistics which the Government of the United Kingdom has at its disposal? Where are the spatial maps of crime and anti-social behaviour? Where are the maps of low educational attainment? Where are the concentrations of homeless individuals and families? Where are the greatest numbers of long-term unemployed? Where are the biggest concentrations of disadvantaged groups such as the Traveller community, unemployed people with disabilities, ex-offenders and people with addiction problems?</P>
    <P>The failure by the Government and its agencies to compile and present a clear national report on spatial disadvantage provides an easy excuse to do next to nothing and year after year the same urban and rural communities continue to suffer. It is against this background that I view the introduction of the island allowance in section 15, which gives an additional allowance of £10 per week for certain pensioners. I welcome the initiative but wonder why it could not be extended to pensioners in other disadvantaged areas both urban and rural.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have received a bitter complaint from the Irish Wheelchair Association and disabled constituents regarding the mobility allowance. The allowance is set to double to £90 per month in April and compensates people who are disabled for the lack of accessible public transport. We are informed that, from April next, people receiving tax concessions towards the purchase of an adapted private vehicle will not be entitled to mobility allowance. Is this the case and, if so, is it another example of one Minister giving something and another Minister taking it away? The criteria for mobility allowance are stringently applied and because of this, there are only about 2,600 beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government launched an initiative aimed at disadvantaged areas. Like its earlier efforts, there seemed to be a lack of vision and coherence in the manner in which the RAPID programme was introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Ryan. RAPID stands for revitalising areas by planning, investment and development. It marks the belated appearance of the targeted investment programme promised under the PPF about which I have repeatedly asked the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy <Col N="50" /> Ahern, at Question Time. Deprived areas of my constituency in north Coolock form one of 25 districts chosen for targeted investment. It seems, however, that there are no targets or mission statement for this new programme and that the Government has chosen to create yet another layer of bureaucracy to run the programme rather than utilise the existing tier of district government, the partnership companies. On the crucial issue of funding, the position is vague, to say the least, although we have just been informed that there will be £200 million available for social inclusion measures under the national development plan. I hope this does not include money which Commissioner Pedro Solbes, who recently visited the Minister's part of the country, wishes to claw back from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>This is the fourth and, perhaps, final Social Welfare Bill to be introduced by the Minister. His period in office offered an unparalleled opportunity to implement a programme of social inclusion measures to embrace all the people. Instead the division between rich and poor is widening as the proportion of national income allocated to social welfare recipients falls steadily. Eurostat figures for 1998 show that, at 16%, the GDP spend in Ireland on social protection was by far the lowest in the European Union.</P>

      <P>The Bill introduces welcome reforms such as the improvement in the assessment of means provided for in section 13. The 2001 social assistance and social insurance payment rates provided for in the Bill, however, reflect the harsh economic outlook of the Government. For that reason, the Labour Party must oppose the Bill. The failure to compensate social welfare claimants and their families for the ravages of inflation is a further indictment of the Government's lack national vision, particularly on social issues. It has failed in its responsibilities to key groups of citizens dependent on social welfare. Despite the smug boasting of the Minister, pensioners, parents of young children, carers, qualified adult dependants, widows and widowers with young children and many other social welfare claimants remain dissatisfied with the Government and continue to feel hard done by. Those living in disadvantaged areas are of the view that the economic boom has passed them by. Although the Labour Party will try to amend it, where possible, on Committee Stage, the Bill is another sad monument to the failure of the Minister. The electorate will have a chance to pass judgment, perhaps sooner than he thinks.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> I wish to refer to some of the major improvements provided for in the Bill which demonstrates the commitment of my party and that of the Government to look after the less well-off in society, to meet the needs of children, older people, carers and all those dependent on the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>In the past three and a half years the structure of society has changed significantly. The unemployment rate has fallen to around 4% and over 300,000 new jobs have been created, freeing resources and reducing the percentage of Government expenditure on social welfare. In spite of this, there has been an increase in spending in key areas such as old age and retirement pensions, child support, carers and people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The biggest ever increase in social welfare payments was provided for in the budget. In 1997, a sum of £214.5 million was provided for in the budget; in 1998, £225 million; in 1999, £16.5 million; in 2000, £403.38 million; and in 2001, £850 million, a fourfold increase on the 1997 figure. This gives lie to the statement by Opposition spokespersons that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, has been failing in his duty to provide for those dependent on the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The increase in old age pension will be £10, bringing the rate to £106 per week. Where both members of a couple are over 66 years of age, the increase in contributory old age pension will be £25, bringing the rate to £185.60 per week. The increase in non-contributory old age pension will be £19 per week. Fianna Fáil granted an increase of £5 per week to old age pensioners in 1998; £6 in 1999; £7 in 2000; and £10 this year. In comparison, the rainbow Government provided for increases of between £1.50 and £3.</P>
    <P>Opposition spokespersons have decried the increases and stated what they would do in our position. Why did they not do what they have continually preached in opposition? The credence one can give their utterances is diminished when one looks at their performance in government.</P>
    <P>The child benefit scheme has been targeted by the Government and all political parties as the most efficient and effective way to channel help to children. The increases announced in budget 2000, provided for in section 66 of the Bill, will bring investment in this area in 2001 to £761 million, a significant increase on the figure for 1997 of £397 million. Fianna Fáil has increased child benefit by £25 for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent children. The rainbow Government provided for increases of £1 and £5, respectively. Deputy Hayes berated the Minister for granting what he described as miserly increases. Having met parents in my constituency, I cannot subscribe to what he said. The Fine Gael spokesperson is in denial if all he can do is decry such a positive policy.</P>
    <P>Other family supports have been significantly increased. The net increase in family income sup<Col N="52" /> plement, of tremendous importance to 15,000 persons in society, will be £15 per week due to the increase in thresholds of £25 per week. The payment of four additional weeks of maternity and adoptive leave will be of tremendous assistance to young parents.</P>
    <P>Significant changes have been made to the PRSI system. In sections 8 and 9 there are reductions in charges, an increase in the earnings ceilings, abolition of employers' liability and a reduction in the rate of social insurance for the self-employed. All these changes are aimed towards bringing the tax and social welfare systems together. Most of the people who have contacted me about the abolition of the employers' PRSI ceiling are in the pharmaceutical and information technology industries where earnings are very high. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has explained many times, including yesterday, that many of these people calculate their increased costs on a full year basis. As the Minister stated, the 2001 financial year will be a short one at roughly three quarters the length of a normal financial year and the impact of the abolition will not kick in for the majority of people, even those on high salaries of up to £50,000, in the next year. He stated he has new plans to be unveiled in his next budget in October which he claims will be widely welcomed. Knowing the Minister, I am sure he has innovative plans to improve the PRSI and taxation systems and to bring them together.</P>
    <P>Carers have also gained significantly from this budget. The carer system was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Woods, in a Fianna Fáil Administration a number of years ago. It has been of tremendous assistance since it was introduced and the system has been refined and improved since its introduction. The changes this year &ndash; the means test threshold increased from £75 to £125 and from £150 to £250 &ndash; will mean a further 5,000 people will benefit. The effective increase will ensure a couple with two children earning a joint income in the region of £15,100 will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £25,100 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance. In addition to qualifying for those allowances, the free schemes and the respite care grant will become available to those people. It is another step forward in providing help and aid to people who stay at home to care for their parents or any member of their family who is ill. This scheme should be improved further.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit scheme was introduced in legislation published last week or the week before by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. That is another step forward which will benefit people who must stay at home and it will also benefit their families. People will now be able to take temporary leave from their jobs.</P>
    <P>I have outlined many of the positive elements in the Bill. I commend the legislation to the House because it addresses the commitments set out in the Government's programme aimed at building an inclusive society which improves the <Col N="53" /> living standards of everyone on social welfare, and because it fulfils our commitments under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputies Broughan and Hayes, one is increasingly reminded that they have a great deal in common. Both have a habit of overstating their case. They have both fallen victim and are prone to overstatement as a style in debates in the House and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I find it disturbing that, while Deputy Broughan clearly does not take that overstatement too seriously, it appears the Fine Gael spokesman on this subject, and on a range of portfolios he has held, takes his overstatement too seriously. It is always a concern when people begin to believe their propaganda. Deputy Hayes has moved slickly from portfolio to portfolio employing overstatement as his chief technique for criticising the Government. Whether it was the housing crisis and hyping the nature of the crisis and the response to it or, when it came to Northern Ireland, whether it was deploying the neo-Unionist language and line once deployed by the former Fine Gael leader, Deputy John Bruton, Deputy Hayes has always excelled himself in overstatement. He overstated the pro-Unionist case Fine Gael made until relatively recently. We on this side of the House are now delighted that it has finally decided to join the great pan-Nationalist consensus. This is an amazing turnaround and we are delighted to witness it.</P>
      <P>I hope that, given time, when Fine Gael members look back on the Bill, they will have a change of heart and mind. When historians come to write about this period and this legislation, they will probably say this was the finest moment in social engineering, when we changed a gear within society and moved away from a society where we were highly taxed and had no money to spend on social intervention. They will probably say this was the turning point when the Government decided to mark its purposeful intention to improve the circumstances of those less well off in society. This legislation will stand the test of time because the increases are phenomenal, whether they relate to carers, people on lower incomes or pensioners seeking an increase. All categories of people who can claim to be disadvantaged or downtrodden or who have not gained from recent economic success gain from this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is exceptional and a turning point in terms of the large amounts of money involved, but it is not just exceptional. It is also well thought out. It comes as part of a long line of budget announcements on the social welfare code which show a remarkable consistency on this side of the House. We as a party and a Government have always cared for disadvantaged people and <Col N="54" /> we deliver year in year out in this regard. The criticism, more often made by Labour than Fine Gael, that we concentrate too much on tax reduction rather than on social inclusion and social improvement is utterly wrong. One of the major lies perpetrated by the Labour Party is that we focus on tax reductions and do nothing when it comes to the social engineering through the social welfare code to ensure people on low incomes or no incomes have an opportunity to play a real role in society.</P>
    <P>It is important we not only commend the Bill but also the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, because he has been remarkably consistent not only in his role as Minister but also as a leading light in our political party advocating the social democratic and republican ethos of our party through newspaper articles, speeches and profound contributions of one form or another. He is a remarkable man who is perhaps overseeing a remarkable transformation in the lot of the people. He deserves full credit for that.</P>
    <P>It has been odd to see the Labour Party and Fine Gael cosying up to each other in recent weeks in the hope of forming a Government. Fine Gael dropped its policies on corporate donations and its members will possibly raise the white flag on all the old traditional Fine Gael policies and surrender to the Labour Party in their hunger not only to devour their former leaders but to get into Government and drive off in the Mercedes. That is their attitude and it will not work.</P>

      <P>What is remarkable is that, not only is the unionism gone to be replaced by a new, shiny green nationalism but so also is all semblance of Fine Gael's old, robust, right wing policies. The reality is that the parties opposite, Fine Gael and Labour, are the more conservative parties in the House. The real radicalism and commitment to social justice is to be found and heard on the Government benches. Our party is the one forging the big changes in modern Ireland. Deputy Flanagan's party was in Government several years ago and had the opportunity to bring about big changes but all the pensioners and social welfare recipients got was small change, literally, from Deputy De Rossa when he was Minister. They got small increases that nobody would bother to notice. Deputy Michael Ahern is to be commended for making that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been repeatedly and wrongly criticised by the Labour Party for what that party sees as an obsession with reducing tax rates and a related failure to spend money on people and services. That is hopelessly incorrect. We are continuing to reduce the tax burden to improve the funding position of the Exchequer when it comes to spending on social policies, so much so that Members opposite have joined with the europhiles in criticising us in recent days. The Opposition parties have been to the forefront in <Col N="55" /> trying to embarrass the Government by quoting the European Commission's adverse views on our economy and our spending levels in social and other areas. However, they cannot have it both ways. They cannot agree with Brussels criticising us for spending too much and then say that we are not spending enough on social welfare. There is an elemental contradiction in the Opposition's approach. Either we are spending too much or too little but it seems to change from day to day and week to week, depending on whether one is listening to Deputy Noonan or Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>There are strong reasons we should continue with our policy of tax reductions. It is not fashionable to point it out in left wing circles, and I am as left wing as anyone else on these benches, but the Reagan administration reduced the top rate of tax in America from 70% to 28% in the face of many ill-conceived left wing prophecies of doom. What happened? Personal tax revenues tripled and the foundation was laid for the long boom the American economy enjoyed until recently. That is the reality of cutting top and middle tax rates as well as those tax rates which bear down on the disadvantaged and unemployed.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of what the Government is trying to do and it is right to focus on the tax mission. That was a formal promise we made to the electorate. We made a formal pact with our partners, the Progressive Democrats, but we also made one with the electorate not just at the beginning of the election, but ten days before the polling day when we made a formal pact to continue to cut rates. I hope Deputy Flanagan and his friends in Brussels take that message back: we will continue to cut the taxes when we introduce our next budget towards the end of the year. We will continue with the formal promise we made to the public not just in the area of social inclusion, but more importantly in tax reduction. The high burden of tax reduction has borne down heavily on those on low pay and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government's tax reduction policy is the centre of social inclusion. Our party contains perhaps the only people in the House who have the vision to promote social inclusion as a concept. We have seen 1 million pensioners and qualified adults secure unprecedented increases in this budget and we have also seen an estimated 531,000 families benefiting from the massive increases in child benefit. We have also seen in this budget how 17,500 families on low incomes will benefit from the increased income threshold for family income supplement. One of the most enlightened aspects of the Minister's policies is the increase in the maternity and adoptive benefits, which are central to women's participation in the work force. If there is one cause this Government can be associated with, it is that we have forcefully pursued the interests of women and equality both in and outside the work force, whether that relates to increased maternity and adoptive leave or increased pay and child benefit terms. We are the people who are delivering for <Col N="56" /> women, who demand the right, as they should, to participate equally in the work force and every aspect of our national life.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lenihan never ceases to lighten a debate and to take away its seriousness, whether it is about Northern Ireland, economic issues or social welfare matters. One can always be sure his contribution will be colourful and light. He can start a sentence by lauding a model of European social democracy from one corner of his mouth and by the end of the same sentence, from the other corner of his mouth, he can talk admiringly about Ronald Reagan. Such is the spectrum available to Deputy Lenihan's political philosophy. He never ceases lightening a debate with a certain colour that makes consistency seem totally irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan spoke about what the caring Government had done to ease the plight of those in the poverty trap but nothing could be further from the truth. In spite of the increased funding to which Deputy Lenihan refers, if one looks at the Social Welfare Bill in the cold light of day and in the context of the budget, is this the best we can do to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots in society? If the Government will leave any legacy when it is removed from office later this year, it will be that it has attempted to impose on the people a nakedly American capitalist-style system, a system which the people are not buying.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a letter from the Irish Wheelchair Association regarding recent budgetary changes announced by the Minister for Finance and backed up by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in this Bill. Members of that association, perhaps the most vulnerable group in society, are upset and anxious because of negative budget changes announced in December's budget. I refer particularly to the mobility allowance. For years that allowance ensured that £45 per month paid by the health board acted as some form of inducement to those who were not mobile to get out of their houses, if only for a short period. The payment was designed to compensate people permanently unable to walk for <Col N="57" /> the lack of accessible public transport and applied particularly in rural areas to people such as those in my constituency. However, we now see an increase in that allowance from 1 April 2001 from £45 to £90 will only be available to a small few who qualified for that allowance to date. I do not know how many hundreds of people will be adversely affected by this cut in the mobility allowance but I urge the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance to rethink this callous and insensitive attack on the most vulnerable people in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs missed an opportunity to pull tens of thousands of people out of the poverty trap with this Bill. He has refused to do so. He and the Minister for Finance are presiding over a regime where thousands of people are losing their entitlement to a medical card.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of this report and I commend the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency and our own CSO for their initiative in bringing it to fruition. The publication is timely in that it comes when we in both parts of Ireland, North and South, are entering into a new era of co-operation with a focus on development to our mutual benefit. Good quality statistics will play a key role in the process by allowing us to focus in an objective manner on the similarities and differences which exist between our respective populations and economies.</P>
      <P>The most notable feature of the data is the degree of similarity exhibited in many of the statistical series presented. For example, both jurisdictions have relatively young populations by international standards, while the recent trends in births, deaths and marriages are remarkably similar. There are differences also: the lower pupil-teacher ratio in the North and the superior economic performance in recent years in the South. We can undoubtedly learn from one another through careful analysis of the reasons underlying these and other differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that both agencies see the report as the first in a series, and I look forward <Col N="58" /> to future editions which I am sure will be valued by users in both the North and the South.</P>

      <P>There is a considerable amount of information which is extremely worrying in this comparative study. For example, public housing in the South is progressing at a slower rate, there is a greater rate of suicides in the South, and a greater number of traffic related deaths, which will be again discussed in Private Members' time later today. Would the Minister agree, for example, that he should respond to this report with some stated targets for catching up in a number of areas where that is badly needed? Will he respond by giving a date, for example, when there will no longer be 380,000 holders of provisional licences allowed to drive unaccompanied on our roads, something which would not be countenanced in the North? Could he give any details as to when he will respond to the clear challenges presented in this report by giving target dates as to when we will at least be on a level with the North in relation to critical areas where we have been found wanting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give dates relating to the matters the Deputy raised. These statistics will be used by the different Government Departments to progress their programmes, North and South. This report is a very good one which I would urge Members to look at. It contains much fascinating information. It shows that in most areas the South is substantially ahead of the North. In one or two areas the South is behind the North. For example, the pupil-teacher ratio is a little lower in the North than in the South, and there are differences in a number of other areas. However, in terms of GDP per head, housing, female participation in the labour force, agriculture, transport, tourism, we are in substantially better shape than the North.</P>
      <P>One thing the Deputy mentioned which is certainly worth noting is that between 1990 and 1998 the number of road accident deaths per 100,000 people was consistently lower in Northern Ireland than in the Republic. We are certainly lagging behind in that area, and it is the subject of a debate before the House at the moment. I encourage Members to study this report because there really is a great deal of useful information and some pointers in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned housing. The only statistic I can see here on housing is that two fifths of households in the Republic are owned outright by the occupier. The comparative figure in the North is 33%. There is thus a higher rate of home ownership in the Republic than there is in Northern Ireland. The report is littered with such information which has implications for pol<Col N="59" /> icy. The various Departments will follow up on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is disputing that the report is fascinating. I agree that it is very informative and interesting. However, I ask the Minister not to simply pass this on to the Departments for their attention but to give priority to taking steps that can be taken without the need for legislation. There is obviously a need for legislation in relation to penalty points, but in regard to provisional licence holders driving unaccompanied, can he say that action will be taken forthwith to end that practice, given that it has been shown to be an area of difference between North and South which is likely to have led to considerably more road accidents on this part of the island? Can the Minister say that matter will be prioritised, rather than simply passing it to Departments for their attention?</P>

That is the approach to making the appointments. The CSO has a practice, which is very much in force on this occasion also, of giving preference when making these appointments to persons who are not in paid employment. As far as I know, the Department of the Taoiseach did not send out a directive in that regard, given the CSO policy. It is a well known policy which the office has used previously.</P>

      <P>They have to collect the forms and discuss them when they are collected in the four week period after 29 April. It is part of their brief to assist the person in completing the form and if the form is not completed, they will discuss it with the person on the doorstep and assist him or her in doing it. Where Irish is required in that regard, I am almost certain the applicant would be asked at interview if he or she could do that.

      <Col N="63" /> The total tonnage in the nine months to 30 September 2000 is 225,000 compared with 298,000 in 1999. The main categories are fresh potatoes, frozen potatoes, tomatoes and frozen vegetables. They mainly come from Great Britain, Netherlands, Spain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is alarming that we are importing 225,000 tonnes of vegetables. This country has the best climatic conditions in the world for growing vegetables. That is especially the case in my constituency and in south west Kerry where the warm waters of the Gulf Stream lap the coastline. We never get frost or snow. It is one of the best vegetable growing regions in Europe but we still import that huge amount of vegetables. Something must be done to promote vegetable cultivation in this country. Can the Minister of State provide a copy of the statistical breakdown?</P>

      <P>The Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs met on ten occasions in 2000. The last meeting took place on Wednesday, 31 January 2001 and the next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, 28 February.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet subcommittee continues to give political direction to the Government's social inclusion policies, including the national drugs strategy.

      <P>I am familiar with the Minister of State's work in this area as we share a constituency. Is he satisfied that the original resistance among residents groups to the provision of methadone treatment centres has been satisfactorily resolved in that treatment centres have been established? Are enough centres up and running to meet the estimated demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997 there were 21 treatment centres and there are 60 at present. There is still some resistance in certain areas to methadone maintenance. However, there are no problems in areas where these centres have been opened. <Col N="65" /> Crumlin is perhaps the best example of this. This time last year 60 to 70 people were on the waiting list in Crumlin. Two centres have been opened and currently the number on the waiting list is negligible.</P>
      <P>I spoke to residents groups at a public meeting in the area and they stated that once the centres are up and running the fears which existed disappear. They also pointed out that the level of crime has reduced and people are very positive about the fact that the centres are working.</P>
      <P>Many Members have encouraged other communities to accept these centres as they prove beneficial. However, unfortunately there are still problems in some areas which have the largest number of people on the waiting list.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question last December, the Minister of State said there were no deadlines for the submission of plans by local drugs task forces. What is the up-to-date position? Is there a deadline for the submission of these plans?</P>
      <P>There is evidence of hard drinking and binge drinking. Is the Minister of State working closely with the Minister for Health and Children on this issue? Where stands responsibility for taking decisive action on, for example, putting bar codes on cans so they can be traced to particular off-licences and whatever other measures are needed to deal with the access which young people have to drink? Is there a line between the Minister of State's responsibilities in this regard and those of the Minister for Health and Children, or are they working together?</P>

      <P>Initial funding has been allocated to Ballymun, Cork and Dublin 12. Three plans will go before the Cabinet subcommittee next week regarding Clondalkin, Dún Laoghaire and Finglas/Cabra. At least three other plans will go before next month's meeting regarding the canal communities, Dublin north east and Tallaght.</P>
      <P>In the budget the Minister for Finance gave a special allocation of £10 million for capital projects for premises in the local drugs task force areas. We are finalising the location of 16 projects which we will present at the next Cabinet subcommittee meeting for further moneys for local drugs task forces. These projects are spread throughout the city.</P>
      <P>I have had meetings with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, as have our officials, to try and amalgamate the issue of alcohol abuse into the national drugs strategy. This issue regularly came up during the public consultation component of the review strategy. Alcohol will be part of the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> We have not issued deadlines as we do not think people need them. Most local drugs task forces are seeking funding and are anxious to submit plans. All the plans will be submitted shortly. It must be borne in mind that some of this is initial funding. We gave £500,000 to Ballymun, £787,000 to Cork and £510,000 to Dublin 12. We are looking at other projects which have been submitted and will allocate further moneys.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister of State last answered questions on this issue on 10 October 2000. Does he agree that, although he said at the time that waiting lists were about to be eliminated, there is still a problem in that people have to wait for long periods to access treatment? Is he aware that in Blanchardstown, for example, which is one of the areas designated under the anti-drugs programme, many young people still cannot find places? Does he agree this is unsatisfactory?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State report on the current situation regarding rehabilitation and after care? Does he recall that on the last occasion he stated that we are trying to move people on recovery through rehabilitation and counselling? The infrastructure has not been put in place. What definitive steps will be taken immediately so that people can move from methadone maintenance to rehabilitation counselling? That is not happening at present to any satisfactory degree.</P>
      <P>As regards under 18 year olds, what is the Minister of State's proposal for such people who are addicted to heroin and who are lost in the system? There was one pilot programme. However, people under 18 years of age are not able to access the limited normal programmes which have been put in place. This is a serious problem. I want to know what is being done and what the Minister of State will do in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 1,372 people in treatment in 1995 and that figure had increased to more than 5,000 at the end of December last year. The numbers on the waiting list are almost the same. We must open more treatment centres or methadone maintenance clinics. Unfortunately, however, there is resistance in communities to such centres. The health board would open them more quickly if it did not meet such resistance. I am sure the Deputy has seen the resistance and the type of fear which is unfairly instilled in people. People are worried and their reactions are often seen at public meetings on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year I allocated more than £1 million to aftercare programmes. This money has been allocated across task forces for specific aftercare projects. The independent assessment <Col N="67" /> which was carried out shows that 40% of people went back to work. There is a greater emphasis in the new plans from the local drug task forces on the area the Deputy mentioned. That is a step in the right direction. The national drugs strategy team is positive about this development. The plans are aimed at funding rehabilitation and counselling projects in their own areas. It is difficult to assess that but we are making progress. A number of years ago people were looking for methadone maintenance services. The plans in the areas which got those services at an early stage are moving towards the area in which the Deputy and I want to see progress.</P>
    <P>As regards treatment for people under 18 years of age, I concur with the Deputy that it is a problem. A number of people presented a proposal to me two weeks ago to set up a different type of strategy for underage treatment and rehabilitation. We are considering that. This area must be examined and it will be covered in the national drugs strategy.</P>

      <P>When will the Cabinet subcommittee get its act together and sanction the necessary money for projects which have sought funding from the young people's facilities fund for community and sporting activities? This is the fourth occasion I have raised the proposal from the Cabra Drugs Task Force for a community and sports complex in John Paul Park in Cabra. This project is waiting over two years for the necessary funds to start building the centre. Dublin Corporation has provided the site and the local community has raised approximately £50,000, yet the project has been in stalemate for some time awaiting a decision. We mentioned deadlines. While there appears to be hundreds of millions of pounds available for national stadia, projects for local facilities seem to have been put on the long finger.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that if we do not provide community and sporting facilities, we are wasting our time trying to divert young people from drugs, whether they are illegal drugs or underage people dealing with legal drugs, such as alcohol? I ask the Minister of State to take this issue seriously this time and to give us a response. Everything else is ready to go in that area which has been hard hit by drugs in the past. The local community and Dublin Corporation need sanction from the Cabinet subcommittee which we are told met on 11 occasions. However, it does not appear to be able to make many decisions which will be effective in combating drugs among young people if it cannot make a decision on a project such as this one.</P>

It was due at the end of January but I understand it will be some weeks before it is published. Is there a view in the Cabinet subcommittee that we need to start tackling the issue of recreational drugs, such as solvents, ecstasy and cannabis? The measures required to tackle this issue are different from those required to deal with hard-core drugs, such as heroin and cocaine. Is there a specific strategy in the new drugs strategy review to deal with recreational drugs on a nation-wide basis or will they be dealt with in the same way as hard-core drugs are dealt with in the capital city? </P>
      <P>As regards underage drinking, perhaps the Minister of State could explain why the Government is stubbornly refusing to introduce a mandatory identification card scheme for young people. I cannot understand the objection of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to it, particularly when the voluntary identification card scheme is not working.</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister of State's view that we need to change tack in relation to drug and rehabilitation services in the prison system?

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the first question, it will be published in March. I agree that recreational drugs present a separate problem that extends throughout the country. While I welcome the recent report in which it is stated that it is decreasing, I would have to place a question mark beside it. That is one of the reasons the national advisory committee is examining the issue. One of the advantages of having such a committee is that the position can be examined to obtain hard data. While we receive many international reports, one wonders how accurate they are. Nonetheless, I welcome the report's findings on the decrease in the use of recreational drugs. It is time we conducted our own research to obtained hard facts on the extent of drug abuse within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the issue of recreational drugs is different, we will have to examine the idea of an educational campaign as well as getting parents and schools involved. There seems to be an impression that one can take recreational drugs without side effects, but that is not the case. According to anecdotal information, the heroin problem has stabilised and may be reducing. We <Col N="70" /> have been informed that in some communities young people between the ages of 15 and 17 years who are abusing ecstasy &ndash; perhaps taking five or six tablets a night &ndash; are beginning to smoke heroin to come down off it. While it has not been proven, it is a matter about which we are concerned. Those working on the problem in one flat complex informed me recently that the young people concerned were not there when heroin and AIDS presented huge problems. As they never experienced heroin and its associated problems, they are unaware of the difficulties involved. That is a worrying trend and we will have to keep a close eye on it.</P>
    <P>As regards under-age drinking, I intend to speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about identity cards. It comes under his remit, not mine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentioned housing, a problem that has come about because of the success of some of the programmes which have been put in place. It will not be an easy one to resolve. The same problems will arise when somebody who is recovering from heroin abuse is put in. We are examining the issue. At a recent meeting regarding young people and heroin the question of rehousing people within flat complexes and housing estates was also covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would some kind of sheltered housing or half-way house system be useful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Many have said that there should be a half-way house system for those coming through the recovery process, a place to which they can go to recharge their batteries if they are feeling down. While many are working and earning money, they have nothing to do. They cannot go to the pub and do not want to hang around the friends with whom they got involved in drug abuse before. Where do they go? They find it extremely difficult. We have to ensure services are available to make sure they stay off drugs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins mentioned rehabilitation programmes, of which we have introduced a number. Speed-Pack was one such programme financed during the year. We also helped to finance the labour inclusion programme which was supported by IBEC and the ICTU. As FÁS has 1,000 places, many such programmes are only starting up. The local drugs task forces have drawn up plans for rehabilitation by returning people to the workforce and training them according to their personal needs and abilities. There is no magic wand, however, because the people concerned have encountered great difficulties in their lives. I hope, however, with a hands-on approach they can be returned to the workforce and a drug-free situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the reports about crack cocaine, probably the most dangerous illegal drug. The problems it has caused in American inner cities are incredible. I intend to inquire about how extensive the problem is here. We have not <Col N="71" /> received any feedback from local drug task force personnel about it being a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not too late when it is a problem? There have been four seizures by the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that report and intend to take the matter up with the Garda Síochána to ascertain exactly how extensive the problem is. It is obvious there is a problem if there have been four seizures. While the problem of solvents abuse arose in a recent report also, it hardly featured in the review of the national drugs strategy. Over 20% of those questioned for the recent report said they had taken solvents, but we are not getting that information from our research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Question No. 86 of 4 October 2000, I made clear my wish to support the board of the National Theatre in its plans to create an Abbey Theatre which can look with confidence to affirming its role at the heart of theatrical development in Ireland, as the theatre approaches the centenary of its foundation.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the board of the National Theatre Society Limited submitted a number of options to me regarding the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre. At that time its preferred option was for the redevelopment of the theatre at its existing location. While it was clear in the proposals that the existing site was limited in scope, it was intended that these limitations would be minimised with imaginative design and the maximum use of space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my examination of these proposals was <Col N="72" /> proceeding, I received word from the board of the National Theatre that it was re-evaluating its options in response to intimations that sites at several other locations, including one owned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority at Grand Canal Basin, were likely to be available. Accordingly, the board advised me on 27 October 2000 that its preferred option was for the redevelopment of the National Theatre at the Grand Canal Basin site. At my request, the Office of Public Works carried out an analysis of the merits of this option and its report was submitted to me on 6 February last. There is concern in the report that the site on offer at Grand Canal Basin may not fully fulfil the brief of requirements as outlined by the board of the National Theatre Society.</P>
    <P>In light of this report and given my preference, which I expressed on a number of occasions in the past, that the National Theatre should if at all possible remain at its present location on Abbey Street if design constraints could be mitigated, I asked the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and in consultation with the National Theatre Society, to explore and to report to me on the options that exist in the matter of acquiring additional site space adjacent to the existing Abbey site with a view to developing a new landmark theatre at this location. This report will also consider other possible city centre relocation options and will inform my consideration of the future development of the National Theatre, including the proposals I will bring to Government in due course.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree the Abbey Theatre is more than an ordinary theatre, it is a national theatre. It is there to serve the country and it is frequented by many visitors to Ireland, Americans and others. It is a national institution. Does the Minister agree the facilities available to the theatre, whether on the existing location or at a new location, are even more important than the location of the theatre? Have representations been made by the Taoiseach in this regard? I hope that when the decision is made, whenever that will be, she will not be intimidated by the Taoiseach's wishes to maintain the theatre in his parish, if not his constituency, in spite of historic connotations, given that it was founded at its existing location almost 100 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the Taoiseach does not intimidate his Ministers; that is not his approach.</P>
      <P>With regard to the options and preferences, the Taoiseach made his view known in a recent press statement. When I visited the Abbey last year, initial discussions had taken place on this matter and the Abbey was considering three options related to the existing site. It was not until last August that the other two sites became available and the options and priorities of the board of the National Theatre then changed. From an early stage I made it clear that my preference was that there would a complete refurbishment of the site and a radical approach to addressing the facilities on the existing site.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy correctly emphasised, I am sure all of us would acknowledge that this theatre is the national theatre and has wonderful standing not only nationally but internationally. It does not have the facilities to mirror the tremendous talents that exist and the work that has been done in the theatre over the years. It is a 1960s building that needs complete and utter renovation. That is possible on the site.</P>
      <P>I have asked the corporation and the Office of Public Works to work in conjunction with the Department to ascertain what facilities are available in the vicinity that could be used to enhance the facilities of the Abbey Theatre. All of these matters are being considered. I hope to have that report from the Office of Public Works in the next few weeks. It has assured me it will be able to deliver the report in that short timeframe. Following receipt of it, I will have all the issues to hand and I will be able to make a considered decision.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, however, about the Office of Public Works's report regarding the Grand Canal site, as it does not seem to have the necessary space for the proposals put forward by the board of the National Theatre. All of these matters have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with the Deputy that we need to be able to provide the facilities of which any national theatre would be proud. Sadly, we do not have those facilities at present in the Abbey Theatre.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree we are facing a severe public health crisis in terms of alcohol abuse, that Ireland comes top of the league in Europe in that regard, that there is no avoiding the conclusion that television and radio advertising plays a substantial role in attracting young people, even young people who are under age, towards the consumption of alcohol, and that the situation calls for drastic and radical action on her part? Given that the Broadcasting Bill is before the Seanad, it is not too late for the Minister to table an amendment such as the one I suggested. Does she believe the current situation can be allowed to drift and that the solution will come in some form or other from the Broadcasting Commission in due course? This country's appalling alcohol problems are the worst in Europe. The Minister's answer was a negation of her responsibility to young people.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will be responsible for revising and updating particular codes. The Deputy made the correct distinction between alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse, which is under discussion here and in the Seanad. The Minister for Health and Children has expressed his views, and those of his Department, on the matter of alcohol advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To speak of an all-out ban, one must consider the practicalities of the matter. Deputy O'Shea will be aware of the difficulty of achieving an effective ban which fulfils its objectives. A common approach to the problem here, in Britain and across Europe, is needed. It is all very well to regulate indigenous channels, but advertising on foreign channels cannot be controlled. Agreement to ban advertising on indigenous channels may well be reached, but that does not mean content on other channels can be similarly agreed. These issues will be the responsibility of the new commission, under the Broadcasting Bill, 1999. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will have more powers and responsibilities than the existing Independent Radio and Television Commission, including the specific responsibility of <Col N="75" /> updating and revising the codes under section 19(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that she is not responding to a critical situation. She speaks of other member states of the EU who, unlike Ireland, do not have the worst juvenile abusers of alcohol. The Broadcasting Bill is before the Seanad, so it is not too late to do what we ask. The Minister for Health and Children and other Ministers have a role to play in this. Unfortunately the Minister is not sending a hopeful message to parents and those who are involved with young people. The Minister is handing the problem to a new organisation with new powers and in the process ignoring a terrible social problem for which we have quantifiable figures. Information made available this week indicates a connection between a relatively small amount of television advertising <i>vis-à-vis</i> alcohol and its abuse among young people.</P>

I look forward to speaking to the Minister for Health and Children on this issue, and we will see what will come of those discussions. It is important to outline that it is not a simplistic issue, it is quite complex and we do not have as much control in this regard as Deputy O'Shea would like. We must bear in mind that other channels are received by people. This issue which causes concern will be further discussed by my colleagues.</P>

Television licence fees may be purchased at any of An Post's nation-wide network of post offices. An Post estimates the level of evasion to be 10.5% at present. An Post is considering additional methods of pursuing evaders and more flexible payment methods.

      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that the licence fee is a very important element of RTE's entire income. I was going to ask the Minister if there had been a noticeable increase in the number of licence holders in the past three or four years, given that many new houses have been built. The Minister said that it has increased by 19%. What percentage of the licence fee is charged by An Post for its work in collecting it ? The Minister has been requested by RTE to significantly increase the licence fee. I know consultants have been employed to report to the Minister on the matter. When will the Minister be in a position to bring recommendations to Government regarding this request?</P>

      <P>There has been a 19% increase on licences in the past decade. This year's target for sales of licences is 1,170,000, compared to last year's figure of 1,057,296. I do not have the figures regarding collection costs, which is a matter for agreement between RTE and An Post, but I will have them sent on to the Deputy. A proposal on increasing the fee has been made by RTE as the Deputy is aware and I will assess it. If the Minister feels that such an increase is warranted, the proposal is brought to Government for a joint decision. I have looked for expert evaluation of the proposal and am currently considering it. I hope to bring my findings to Government soon.</P>

Amendments to the Habitats Directive require a decision by the Council of Ministers, or in some cases, a co-decision of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should appreciate that not alone is amendment of the Habitats Directive outside my competence, but any attempt on my part to promote an amendment perceived to weaken what the Deputy might consider the &ldquo;restrictive elements&rdquo; of the directive, will not be successful at a European level.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply because we all know that the Habitats Directive has a detrimental impact on the livelihoods of rural people. It is regrettable that there is no mechanism other than what the Minister has referred to. She states that she is not prepared to undertake this. It is a matter of recognising the need to curtail this unintended impact of the directive. The representative of the Commission who attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs expressed alarm at the directive's impact. The Minister must do what is necessary to amend it. Is the Minister aware of the impact it has on the livelihood of rural people, the curtailments it imposes? These people were the guardians of the environment before this directive was adopted. They, without any directive, conserved and protected the species in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. In Opposition and in Government, I said the landowners and users have been the guardians of the environment. That must be recognised.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy was disappointed with my reply. As he should know &ndash; because he was a Deputy at the time &ndash; the European Communities National Habitats Regulations, 1997, which transposed the directive into domestic law, were introduced under the previous Administration in March 1997. Given the legal situation, once transposed into domestic law, it cannot be changed by way of a ministerial order, legislation or statutory instrument. I share the Deputy's disappointment that the directive was accepted.</P>
      <P>In government and opposition I have expressed the great difficulties that can be experienced by landowners. I was presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> when I came into office. I considered what could be done to mitigate those difficulties in terms of SACs, the appeals board, the liaison committees and compensation. That is, unfortunately, the situation on the Habitats Directive, of which I am not a great advocate. The Deputy may be aware of certain statements I made about EU directives relatively recently.</P>

It is not a case of it being unconstitutional. If that was the case, it would have been considered and challenged before now. The point is that this is a<i> fait accompli</i>.

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When I assumed office in June 1997 the situation was far from satisfactory in relation to the protection of the architectural and archaeological heritage. On the architectural side, there was no framework in place for the structured protection of buildings of value. I acted immediately, therefore, on the report of the interdepartmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage, published in 1996. This involved, <i>inter alia</i>, establishing within my Department a new division dedicated to dealing with the protection of the architectural heritage. The division has responsibility for compiling the national inventory of architectural heritage, NIAH, in which an estimated 1 million structures ultimately will be recorded. The NIAH is used as the basis for my recommendations to local authorities on what structures ought to be included in their records of protected structures.</P>
      <P>The division provides expert advice in the form of guidelines on acceptable works to structures included in the record as well as advising on proposed developments which impact on protected structures. A total of 15 staff have been recruited to this new division and I am satisfied that good progress has been made in establishing the framework. Nevertheless, there is still much work to be done. Survey work on the NIAH needs to be stepped up in order that information can be fed to the local authorities sooner. In this regard, my Department recently enlarged the pool of consultants available to do this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for planning authorities and my role is mainly advisory. Local authorities need to establish their records of protected structures without further delay. They can employ their own conservation officers to assist them in their regu<Col N="81" /> latory role. While some have been appointed to date, there must be more appointments and a much greater take-up of such posts if the new measures are to be effective and consistently applied.</P>
    <P>On the protection of the archaeological heritage, I can also report good progress. The archaeological service of my Department had been experiencing difficulties as it sought to grapple with the increasing impact on archaeological sites and monuments arising from the upsurge in building activity. Matters came to a head in early 2000 when the backlog of work became so intolerable that the issuing of new licences had to be suspended for a number of weeks. At the same time, my Department's capacity to deal with underwater archaeological issues had to be suspended as the existing contract for the provision of this service came to an end.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an additional eight archaeologists has been authorised to ease this pressure of work. Long-standing contractual difficulties in relation to a further 17 archaeologists employed on contract in my Department have also been resolved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The net result of these initiatives is that the cadre of archaeologists within my Department has more than doubled in the past year with 40 archaeologists now employed. I am satisfied that there has been a major improvement in the staffing levels for the protection of the built heritage and the matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the candour of the Minister's reply. There may have been an improvement from a zero position, but the Department still does not have a fraction of the required number of staff to ensure valuable national monuments are not interfered with or destroyed. Does the Minister recall that in recent months a report in a newspaper stated that every ten years approximately 10% of the country's archaeological sites are destroyed? This is a shocking figure. While the Minister has recruited a number of staff to oversee the preservation of historic and valuable sites, enough is not being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see a point where she will have sufficient staff to ensure these sites are protected? Such sites are protected in Britain and other countries in western Europe. The Greeks, Italians or British would not allow such sites to be destroyed at the rate of 10% every ten years. I ask the Minister to redouble her efforts to ensure sites are protected.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the survey conducted by the Heritage Council to which the Deputy referred. The protection of sites is one of <Col N="82" /> the most important aspects of my job. That is the reason I wanted to ensure, in terms of the architectural side, a framework was put in place for the protection of buildings. The Deputy will be aware of the legislation the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I introduced in that regard.</P>
      <P>Ireland is lucky that 120,000 archaeological sites are afforded legal protection under the provisions of the National Monuments Act, 1994. Eight archaeologists were appointed to specifically consider this work. There were long-standing contractual difficulties involving 17 archaeologists employed on contract in my Department.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Deasy's sentiments about the protection of our heritage and archaeological sites. Does the Minister accept that people can automatically question the value of certain sites? Deputy Deasy said that planning is over run. When planning authorities receive an application with an objection from Dúchas or an individual and they suggest to the applicant that he or she should employ an archaeologist to supervise the work, the cost involved can be too prohibitive for the individual concerned. Does the Minister accept the system could be abused if the authorities get over-fussy?</P>

      <P>As usual, Deputy Browne has stolen some of my thunder. Following from the Minister's initial reply, does she agree that many archaeological sites were marked on maps a long time ago and were inserted without any major study of them? While I favour the protection of archaeological sites, many young people who apply for planning permission are faced with a request from Dúchas to the planning authority to carry out an archaeological dig which can cost up to £2,000. This is an added financial burden on the young people involved. Will the Minister make representations to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to allow these charges to be tax deductible?</P>

      <P>A great deal of the development taking place is due to the Celtic Tiger, which has put a further strain on the archaeological side of the Department. As a result, I decided to adopt a strategic rather than an <i>ad hoc</i> approach. We needed to ensure there was a balance between development and the protection of our heritage. To bring that about the NRA and the Department have devised an effective code of practice on how these matters should be examined in advance to avoid delays. This practice will be adopted by other groups as it is a good way to proceed. I intend to encourage other bodies to adopt it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 107 and 121 of 4 October 2000. The Swedish Government has identified a number of issues that it wishes to address during its Presidency of the European Union, one of which is the protection of minors from harmful media content. Sweden intends to pursue this issue within the EU to enable the Council of Ministers to adopt council conclusions on the matter. To this end a seminar was recently held in Stockholm on this issue. I remind the Deputies that any proposal that would have a legally binding effect in these areas would have to be presented by the European Commission in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Under provisions of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999 responsibility for drawing up codes, specifically codes and standards, practices and prohibitions in advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting services will devolve to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to be renamed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Bill, when enacted, will enable me to require the proposed Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, to make the question of advertising directed at children its top priority and to report back to me within one year. These issues should be left to the proposed Broadcasting Commission of Ireland as part of its remit to revise and update the codes relating to advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why new proposals would have to emanate from the Commission, bearing in mind that, since 1991, Sweden has legislation in place under which advertising targeted at children under 12 is banned? There is nothing to prevent the Minister from introducing, even at this late stage, an amendment to the Broadcasting Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>During the passage of that Bill through this House, when the Labour Party sought an all-out ban on advertising targeted at children under 12 years of age, in fairness,the Minister came some of the way to meet our demands, but it was far short of what we sought. If Sweden can do it, why can we not? I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage in the passage of the Bill, to examine this issue in a positive fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question posed by the Deputy, &ldquo;If Sweden can do it, why can we not?&rdquo; is the nub of the issue. Unfortunately, Sweden was not as successful as it hoped due to the position I outlined when referring to another question with regard to advertising and alcohol. The imposition of the ban in Sweden was not successful because many Swedish stations prevented <Col N="85" /> from carrying advertising directed at children simply sought and received licences outside Sweden to broadcast their services back into the State. Again, due to the Television Without Frontiers Directive, this was possible, despite the intentions of the Swedish authorities. That issue must be considered.</P>
      <P>The views in the Council of Ministers are wide-ranging. Some have strong views in favour of a complete ban and others have strong views against such a ban. The EU Commission is reluctant to have an EU-wide ban unless there are strong arguments in favour of the ban. Obviously, that depends on the support that can be engendered among member states to put this view forward.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might be interested to know these matters were discussed already on 12 and 13 February at a seminar entitled Children and Young People in the New Media Landscape held in Sweden. At EU level these issues will be examined further on 23 February, but that must happen in the context of the forthcoming review of the Television Without Frontiers Directive.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, to which I referred on 12 and 13 February, many NGOs and sectors of the industry were present, including representatives from my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and RTE. These issues are, therefore, being actively discussed but a great deal of persuasion must take place to reach a consensus among member states.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the difficulties with a ban on advertising alcoholic drink on radio and television. Would she agree that many of the advertisements for alcoholic drink appear in the early evening and are aimed at young people? Would she introduce a ban on advertising alcoholic drink before a certain time, for example, 9 p.m.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This certainly can be considered. I am sure it will be one of the issues which will be discussed if the Minister for Health and Children wishes to discuss this issue with me, and I look forward to that. However, when one is talking about advertising at specific times, one is referring to controls over indigenous channels. One would not be able to control advertising on stations outside the State and therefore one is faced with the same problem which was experienced because of the Television Without Frontiers Directive.</P>

      <P>When dealing with the smoking issue in America, the state of Florida was awarded a large sum in compensation from a tobacco company. Some of that money was used to advertise the anti-smoking campaign, using young people to influence their peers. I wonder whether it would be a good initiative for the Department responsible for culture to get some young people involved in a similar way, advertising the value of not drinking alcohol and getting <Col N="86" /> across the positive message. Perhaps that would be money well spent on advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to my first supplementary question the Minister referred to the legislation introduced in Sweden in 1991 and said the Swedish authorities had not been entirely successful in attaining their objectives. Would she agree that a government is not ever entirely successful at anything and that the fact that Sweden has not been entirely successful is not an argument for not introducing similar legislation here?</P>
      <P>We are discussing two questions here. Question No. 23, refers to radio and television advertising of alcohol, especially in view of the Government's campaign against alcohol abuse. Would the Minister agree that the constant connection between alcohol and both sport and success is not healthy or good and that it contributes to the abuse of alcohol, even by those who are under age? I can recall that one senior sports person would not turn up at a celebration for a minor team which had won a county championship on the basis that, by definition, some of the people, who would have been under 18, should not have been in the public house in the first place. We need to do something to break this culture. Will the Minister give us an undertaking here that she will look into and address this issue in an appropriate way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, who is engaged in business in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the potential danger to Irish agriculture posed by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain. This disease is highly contagious and I have taken the appropriate action to ensure that Irish herds are not affected. An outbreak here would have enormous economic consequences. This country has been free of the disease since 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I placed a temporary ban on the importation from the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, of live animals, animal products, includ<Col N="88" /> ing fresh meat, meat products, milk and milk products, semen, ova, hides and skins from the affected species, that is, cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer. In this regard I have put staff from my Department at district veterinary offices, ports and airports and meat factories on alert for these products. In addition, I have alerted the Garda Commissioner and requested him to devote the appropriate resources to assist with my staff in preventing the importation of the banned products from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The situation is being kept under continuous review. My staff have been in constant contact, both with their colleagues in the UK and the European Commission, to ensure that they are appraised of the developments as soon as possible after they happen. In this regard I understand the European Commission will take a similar decision as taken by us later today at 5 p.m. The issue will be discussed at the meeting of the standing veterinary committee on 27 February.</P>
    <P>I should point out that humans are only rarely infected by the handling of a diseased animal and that infection is only temporary and mild. It is vitally important that there is a full commitment by all concerned to keeping foot and mouth disease out of this country.</P>
    <P>This requires strict compliance with the ban on imports from the United Kingdom and the full co-operation of all those involved in the farming and agri-food sectors in maintaining the highest degree of vigilance for as long as the current threat remains.</P>
    <P>The position is serious. We have not been infected since 1941. The UK commissioners have been informed of the imposition of the ban and a press release informing the public of the measures to be taken will issue today. The position will be reviewed by the standing veterinary committee on 27 February 2001 and, if there is sufficient evidence, although that is by no means certain, Northern Ireland can be excluded from the scope of the ban.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply. I appreciate that this is a highly infectious and contagious viral disease which may spread over great distances with the movement of infected or contaminated animals, products, objects and people. I agree with the Minister of State that, if it reaches our shores, it will represent another dreadful hammer blow to our beleaguered industry. It is spread by cloven footed animals, namely, pigs, cattle, sheep and goats. Those are the susceptible animals as well as the inanimate vectors such as machinery in contact with the exclusion zone.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State ask the Food Safety Authority to issue a statement? While there are no major human health implications, will the Minister of State nonetheless ask it to outline its view on the matter to ensure people are not misled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have all members of the veterinary profession, apart from those in the Department, been noti<Col N="89" /> fied to be on the lookout for the disease? Has the Minister of State contacted his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Bríd Rodgers, and her officials on the matter? It is my understanding that the whole island is disease free. Is that still the case? I am aware that the Minister of State hopes to be in a position on 27 February to clarify the Northern Ireland position. Nonetheless, has he been in contact with Ms Rodgers and her counterpart in Britain?</P>
    <P>What is the position regarding the European Commission? Will there be a meeting of the relevant veterinary inspectors at EU level? If so, are they formulating any measures to help prevent and control the spread of this highly infectious and contagious disease?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that every veterinarian in Ireland is being contacted, but I am sure that they are aware of the position from news items. They would be so aware, above all, being conscious of health in farming. It is important that Members stress the importance of vigilance on this issue. This is not a nod and a wink situation. It must be ensured products originating in or coming through the United Kingdom are not tolerated.</P>
      <P>While we are in constant contact with our Northern Ireland counterparts, we will not clear it until a certain item is clarified. Pigs were delivered to an abattoir and the lorry which delivered them brought back other animals. Until the origin of the animals is cleared, a ban is being placed on Northern Ireland. The Border area is difficult to patrol. That is the reason additional staff have been stationed there to ensure every farmer is extremely vigilant. There was a fantastic response in 1968 to the outbreak in England, of which everyone was conscious. I remember people did not come home on holidays from England in case they brought the disease with them. They were also frowned upon if they came home because an outbreak of the disease would have caused an economic disaster. We need to be vigilant and strong on this issue. The Border area is the difficult matter until we ensure there is no trace of infection present in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his opening comments and welcome the fact that regulations are in place. That said, will we rely on Dáil reports and other news items to inform veterinary surgeons? Are there that many of them that they cannot be contacted directly to ensure they are fully aware of the regulations the Government puts in place? It reminds me of the order concerning BSE made in 1989 by the then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, about which nothing was done until 1996. This issue is so serious that we need to ensure it is dealt with seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to follow up the issue raised by Deputy Penrose. The Border area presents a serious problem. As I live there, I know how difficult it is to man. If we could obtain agreement with the <Col N="90" /> Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland in order that the ports there were properly manned, it would be much simpler than manning the Border. It is one island as far as this disease is concerned.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister of State been in contact with the National Pig Health Council which has been involved in the control of importation in recent years? I understand it is a voluntary body and does a magnificent job. It would be aware of what pigs have been imported recently and which are committed to being imported as far as the pure-bred section is concerned.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that imported meat and meat products are safe and should they be allowed in?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the European Commission will do something similar at 5 p.m. The disease is of a pan-Asian origin. Products from Greece are banned because of the presence of the disease there. The disease occurs mostly in Borneo, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Brazil and other parts of the world remote to us. It is a mystery how it reached the farm in question. It has not yet been established how that happened.</P>
      <P>We have been in hourly contact with the Northern authorities on this issue, especially in tracing the lorry that arrived in Northern Ireland. That is being followed up quickly by the Northern authorities. There is great co-operation between the Departments and authorities in both jurisdictions when it comes to tackling disease. I am sure Deputies will be aware of this from the Ulster Unionist farmers' visits on many occasions. There is joint co-operation.</P>
      <P>Given what Deputy Crawford said, we will try to have our veterinary officers contact all veterinary officers to ensure they are aware of any relevant imports. That includes many types of meat products originating in the United Kingdom. In the current situation, any pigs or animals imported from Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours, which would be around the time the truck arrived in the North, will be slaughtered and detained. If they are found not to have the disease, they will be released after 27 February. It is very strict.</P>
      <P>This issue only arose last night and the reaction of the Department has been spontaneous and quick. Gardaí at points of entry have also been notified. Nothing can help as much in this situation as national co-operation on the part of all those concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his replies so far. He said all the authorities at our sea and air ports are on alert but is that enough? This is an emergency. Should that response not be stepped up? I am aware of the regular call one gets to report to the agricultural authority at a sea or airport but does the Minister of State feel there is a need to step that up? Regarding the products on our shelves, the Minister of State said that imports are banned as of now, I assume, but what about products in the country? How can the Minister of State assure us of the safety of those products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The alert is updated. I am aware of the comments made when one lands at an airport, where procedures may seem a bit tedious or irrelevant because people do not see this as a danger. However, people will now be conscious of the danger and a great national spirit is exhibited in an emergency like this. However, the vigilance and procedures will be updated. Any meat products in the country are not from that area and I assume they are fine. There is very little pig importation into Ireland except on rare occasions when a particular pedigree or type is sought.</P>
      <P>There is a very high alert at present, particularly among veterinary officers near ports. It is hard to stop animals coming across the Border but our officers are on high alert, particularly in port areas, until we learn how this disease came to be where it was found and how confined it is. We do not know how far it has spread but it is in the animals that mixed in this abattoir and animals from a farm near the abattoir were transported to Northern Ireland, so that is our worry. We will co-operate with the authorities there and I am sure we will get a positive response from them, just as we have on other disease issues, such as disease of potatoes for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister of State on this occasion as this disease is very contagious and infectious and very difficult to contain. In the unfortunate event of an outbreak occurring in Ireland is there an emergency plan in place? What kind of action does the Minister of State see as necessary if the disease is to be contained? Does he consider a vaccination programme a possibility for containment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease is highly contagious, particularly in pigs. If there is an outbreak here there will be a plan but the movement of clusters of people will also be restricted, particularly gatherings of people from farms. Those would be immediately banned as a preventative measure, as they were in 1968, and the same would happen in England. We do not know until we see how far this has gone in England, as there is a danger the English authorities may not have known for two or three days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This highly infectious viral disease affects cattle, pigs, sheep, deer and goats and is characterised by the development of blisters in the <Col N="92" /> mouth, causing increased salivation, and lameness. Those in regular contact with animals will see that readily but regarding vaccination or any other systems that could be used, if there is any danger here national measures will be taken immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>

Was his Department notified immediately by the British authorities? How many outbreaks have occurred in Britain since this diagnosis was made? Prevention is better than cure but has the Department taken adequate steps to ensure there is a red alert in operation and that any British meat products now coming into the country will be impounded until such time as the origin of such products is known?

It is unclear when this was found in Britain but there was confirmation last night of what I presume was detected earlier yesterday on farms. The source is at present unclear but the infected animals came from Buckinghamshire and the Isle of Wight. The only other country in the EU where this disease broke out was northern Greece last year and all products from or coming through that area are banned.</P>
      <P>After the outbreak in Britain in 1968, the next outbreak was in 1981. The last case in Ireland was in 1941 so we have a good record of prevention but I seek the co-operation of all members of the public, particularly those in rural areas, in reporting any infringements of the law in this regard to the DVO or to the Garda, who are also on national alert regarding this issue.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State elaborate on an aspect of his reply? I agree with him that the most sensitive area relates to trade <Col N="93" /> between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

      <P>There is regular weekly contact at the highest levels of the Civil Service in Britain and the Civil Service here and the Northern Ireland Civil Service was immediately alerted to this problem. However, we are on alert regarding imports from the UK. There is one truck that brought animals from the farm adjacent to the infected farm and the Northern Ireland authorities are tracing it. They will inform us when they find it, they will ensure there is no movement from it and they will ensure those animals will be slaughtered immediately.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is free trade between our two countries and within the EU. We would not necessarily have knowledge about what came in before this alert. It does not affect the exportation of animals or meat from this country to the UK. However, additional concerns have arisen in respect of the vehicles used to transport such animals and meat. We must ensure that those vehicles are properly disinfected before their return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the exact lines of communication that have been established with the UK authorities? Will communications be between the chief veterinary officers or Secretaries General at the relevant Departments in both jurisdictions or will they take place at political level? Is the nature of these contacts informal or has a formal protocol been put in place to ensure that the latest and most accurate information from the UK and Northern Ireland will be automatically transmitted to the Irish authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that communications will take place at the highest level between the chief veterinary officers and other officials who are in regular contact with their British and Northern Irish counterparts. The European Union will also have a role to play in this regard. There may have been a certain lack of communication within the British system, which is a cause for slight concern. However, the Deputy will be aware that the Commission is going to take control of many areas and ensure that a wider alert system is put in place. I assure him that we will remain in contact with the British <Col N="94" /> authorities dealing with this emergency who are charged with sealing off affected areas and ensuring that the disease does not spread outside those areas. Deputy Upton stated that there are rumours that the disease has spread beyond the original area affected. I have not heard whether that is the case but the disease is highly contagious.</P>
      <P>I imagine that the immediate concern of the British authorities is to contain the outbreak of the disease and they have been most co-operative in providing us with updated information and in ensuring that there is no transportation of animals outside the areas affected. In addition, they have accepted the total ban on the transportation of all animals and meat, including those transported through Great Britain to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of my question, which involves an important matter, was not answered. Regardless of the level at which they take place, it is not sufficient that communications should occur on an informal basis and involve people who know each other keeping in contact by telephone. A formal protocol must be put in place in order that the best and most accurate information is automatically forthcoming to the Irish authorities. If such a protocol does not exist, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should travel to London to ensure that it is put in place. The Minister of State should bring this matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, because I presume from his reply that such a protocol has not been put in place and that the communication of information between senior officials is taking place on the basis of the goodwill and friendship developed out of previous contact.</P>

I accept that the risks to the latter are minimal. What is being done to ensure that the stringent controls being put in place will be completely effective and that people will take extreme precautions when visiting Britain, particularly those areas affected by the disease? Is it correct that the UK has banned the export of all cloven hoofed animals, including cattle, goats, pigs and sheep? Is the Minister of State in a position to indicate if that step, to which Britain's chief veterinary officer referred, been taken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to revert to the question posed by Deputies Clune and Johnny Brady. The Minister of State indicated that, as of now, the importation of foodstuffs from Great Britain has been banned. However, supermarket shelves in this country are already stocked with products from that country which arrived last week, at the weekend or as late as yesterday. Will the Minister of State and his colleagues at the Department of Health and Children take action to have those products removed from supermarket shelves immediately? I appreciate that the ban on importation applies from today, but supermarkets already have in stock foodstuffs from Great Britain which arrived in the past two weeks. This issue must be addressed and the Minister of State has not yet indicated how he intends to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a danger that food products imported in the past two weeks might pose a threat to human health, we will ensure, on foot of advice from our veterinary officials, that they are removed immediately. This matter could give rise to major economic consequences. I am not in a position provide information regarding the safety of food products already on supermarket shelves. The disease has spread quite rapidly in one area of Britain. If food products originated in the north of England, they may pose no threat to human health because they have been prepared before the outbreak of the disease. There is no real threat to human health in any event. Humans only suffer a minor infection, which is easily overcome, on consuming meat infected with the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred earlier to our great national spirit. That spirit is extremely important but, unfortunately, there are a number of rogue farmers, dealers or others abroad and this issue is much too serious to rely solely on the &ldquo;national spirit&rdquo;. For example, I refer to a case in Cork where people where given suspended sentences as a result of irregularities involving a number of cows.</P>
      <P>This is a serious issue. The pig industry, particularly in the Border area, endured a horrendous period when many producers went out of business while others will be obliged to live with the losses they experienced for many years. We cannot afford to take any chances in respect of this matter if we are to protect the pig industry and the other industries to which the Minister of State referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> What plans have been put in place by the Garda Síochána to ensure that, in the short term at least, infected animals are not transported across the Border? As stated earlier, I would have preferred if the importation of animals was stopped at port level on an all-Ireland basis. In the short term we must ensure that the Border is properly manned because we cannot rely on the national spirit to safeguard an industry at risk. The Minister of State has overall responsibility for this matter but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others have a role to play. A clear indication of how it is being dealt with must be provided because our largest industry and people's health must not be put at risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, the Garda Commissioner was contacted this morning and asked to put in place the appropriate support for the Department's veterinary offices on the Border in Dundalk, Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal, Fermanagh and Leitrim. It is difficult to patrol the Border region, however, particularly when one considers the number of back roads, side roads and adjoining farms. We are relying on people to co-operate with the DVO and the Garda Síochána. I am aware that there is a small minority of individuals who would see opportunity in any situation. However, it is time people made the identity of these individuals known to the authorities particularly if their activities pose a threat to the health of livestock animals such as pigs, sheep, goats or deer.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes in the social welfare system in the past ten years have benefited everybody, particularly recipients, and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has been included in the modern business-like response system of politics in that in some places those who call to political clinics can now produce their smart card which has their PRSI number and details electronically stored. This has moved a system of payment from the State to recipients of social welfare in various categories from being a bureaucratic nightmare to something that has become streamlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform speak on the &ldquo;Morning <Col N="98" /> Ireland&rdquo; radio programme about the drink and licensing laws. He said that it would not be possible to issue identity cards to everybody in the State. However, many thousands of people in receipt of social welfare benefits have received identity cards in the form of smart cards which identify who they are, their date of birth and social welfare entitlements. The Minister might indicate what is the future of this system. Will it be to move from a system where the smart cards now held by social welfare recipients will be used for the retention of other electronic data relevant to them? In other words, will it become a more complete form of identification?</P>
    <P>Our education system leaves much to be desired. I had a visit some weeks ago from a reformed alcoholic, a separated mother of four children who has been through a rough time in the past six to eight years. She has completed a VTOS course in various educational facilities which has provided a new challenge in her life, the possibility of a career and betterment for herself. I raise the matter because there appears to be a difference between the treatment of those who receive disability allowance from a health board and those who receive unemployment assistance from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the impact of which relates to the charges levied against them if they take up a course in a GMIT, an institute of technology or on VTOS. This anomaly should be rectified. It is the policy of the Government to allow as many people as possible access to whatever part of the education system they wish. The criteria for charging for this should be changed and made more flexible and fair. Perhaps the Minister will look at this aspect of the treatment of different categories of recipients who wish to avail of similar courses of education.</P>
    <P>The age-old assessment methods of the inspectors of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have been ameliorated to some extent. When I first came into the House, assessments for old age pension purposes went into minute detail in terms of the means and assets, income and potential income of applicants. That has been changed and streamlined and, having attended at appeals with old age pension applicants, I am aware that the social welfare inspectorate is open to looking at whatever case is made on behalf of the applicant. I cannot say that they are not prepared to listen to an argument made in particular cases for old age pension applicants. One aspect, however, needs to be looked at by the Minister. That is where old age pensioners receive double payments in the form of a pension from Great Britain and a supplementary pension from Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the impact of emigration during the years and of the many hundreds of thousands of navvies who left this country and built the motorways, bridges and canal system of Great Britain and other countries. As we have bilateral agreements with a number of these countries, particularly Great Britain, thousands of <Col N="99" /> pensioners here receive both a British pension and a supplementary Irish pension. Where the means of these pensioners are due for review, particularly in relation to the Irish element of the pension, they are likely to suffer serious reductions in the amounts they receive because of the conversion from sterling and the increases allowed in the British budget. The stress and the generally bad feeling which is created by this situation could be alleviated by way of a simple change. The Minister could announce that any person over 75 or 80 years who is in receipt of a British pension and of a part Irish pension will not have this difficulty placed in his way. The numbers involved are relatively small as is the amount of money but the impact on the lives of the pensioners would be huge.</P>
    <P>These pensioners have always felt that they were forced out of this country by bad economic times. They went to work in England to keep families at home alive with the Friday parcel or the monthly cheque. At the end of their days, they should not have this bureaucratic nightmare imposed on their humble living standards. A review carried out on a pensioner of 75 or 80 years means they would be liable to suffer serious reductions because of the exchange rate even though the payment in sterling in the first instance means so much to them. A change such as I suggest would be most welcome and beneficial for the pensioners involved. I hope the Minister will take it on board. The matter was brought to my attention by a number of pension applicants from the west of Ireland, an area that traditionally had a heavy emigration rate to Britain.</P>
    <P>Databases are now available so we are aware of the many thousands of people living in Great Britain whose sense of pride has been dented, who have not been home for many years and who are now living in doss houses and hostels. They receive little care and attention, particularly medical care, except for that provided by organisations such as DÍON and other voluntary organisations operating from Ireland. Many of them are out of touch with their homes, families and communities.</P>
    <P>Given the economic boom, dealing with this issue is not a problem of money but of imagination and effect. The Department should look seriously at a radical approach to bringing these people home. When one talks to them in their alcoholic state, in their misery or in their loneliness, one realises how anxious they are to come home. Many of them were champions of physical work for a generation. They are now unable to work and are seriously drifting down the social scale. The statistics and information available to the Department through the Department of Foreign Affairs is such that their numbers are known. We should be able to find out where they are. They should be contacted and assessed, both physically and mentally if necessary, and given the attention, support and encouragement they <Col N="100" /> need. Where possible, we should at least offer them the opportunity to return to Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are a number of community efforts in this area, such as that in Mulrany, County Mayo, where St. Brendan's and Dr. Cowley have brought people back from England. The happiness of these people to be back in their home place in their last years is sublime. While the home place might have changed physically in terms of buildings and planning, we should never lose sight of the importance of the sense of community, even if the roar of the Celtic tiger can be heard from here to the boundaries of Athens.</P>
    <P>The four points I outlined are relevant. If the Minister were to take these suggestions on board and implement them, it would enhance the status and compassion of his Department. It would also enhance the community in general and, in particular, would have great relevance to the lives of those most directly affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish Deputy Kenny well. This morning the Minister put great emphasis on the fact that the Department has changed the system from one that compensates people for economic failure to one that helps people to help themselves. While that idea is good and should be encouraged, we should not lose sight of the fact that many people are not in a position to help themselves.</P>
      <P>A country will be judged on how it looks after those who are not in a position to look after themselves. The record of the Government in this regard is a proud one. In 1997, a total of £4.5 billion was spent on social welfare. The figure this year will be more than £6 billion. However, increased budgets do not always achieve the results we seek. In many cases it can help, but it is important to ensure that the money is spent wisely and efficiently and that we get value for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, Governments have been criticised for giving commitments before elections and not delivering on them afterwards. This Government has delivered, particularly on social welfare, what it promised. In many cases, it has given more. The old age contributory pension is an example. In 1997 it was £78 per week. That is now increased to £106. When the Government promised it would increase the pension to £100 per week, people said it could not be done. With prudent management, however, we have delivered on that <Col N="101" /> commitment and it is much appreciated by those who are in receipt of it.</P>

      <P>There was an announcement today by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, of increased funding for special housing aid for the elderly. My health board area will get a grant of more than £1.25 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>That was done before I arrived in the Chamber. This is an area that was neglected in the past. During election campaigns one calls to many houses in rural areas and it is clear that there are many elderly people living alone in extremely poor conditions. It has been hard to get anything done about it. One goes between the health board and the county council in search of assistance but it is difficult to find.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, no matter how much one wishes to think the country has changed, we are still a self centred and greedy race. The poorer people are, the fewer friends they have. One need only go to funerals to see that emphasised. Unless they have a special characteristic or socialise regularly, people in general do not want to know about poor people who live alone. If they have a few bob, however, they will always have a few friends. That attitude, unfortunately, is on the increase.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the issue of child benefit. There has been ongoing discussion in recent years about child support, crèche facilities and the best way to deal with the child care issue. Some people have been critical of the Government's performance in dealing with child care. A number of initiatives were undertaken. There is general acceptance that child benefit is the best system of family support. It is a targeted approach which is particularly beneficial to children. The Minister has increased the allowances substantially this year and has promised further increases next year.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a question about the different rates of benefit. The rate for the first two children in a family is increased by £25 per month while the rate for the third and subsequent children is increased by £30. Why should there be different rates per child? In the case of a family with four children, such as in my own case, does the bigger increase relate to the eldest child or the youngest? Perhaps the Minister will clarify this point later. I acknowledge the great improvements in child benefit which the Government has brought about. The Minister has lived up to his promises and I hope he will be in a position to deliver the goods again at the time of the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred earlier to the increase in the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance, from 9,000 in 1997 to more than 17,000 today. While the idea is good, there is concern <Col N="102" /> among carers and among people familiar with their role, that the scheme is very restrictive. Many people who are providing the service are not in a position to avail of the carer's allowance. The conditions should be relaxed to allow more people to benefit. It should be possible to put a costing on this. The service provided by carers was taken for granted for too long. This relatively new allowance is an important recognition, though we can never fully compensate carers for their work.</P>
    <P>Social welfare problems are frequently raised with Deputies at local clinics. Up to quite recently, people sometimes said they could not afford to take up employment because they were better off on social welfare benefits and had a better quality of life. This was one of the reasons for the introduction of the family income supplement, which has certainly made it more attractive for people to work.</P>
    <P>We have seen major changes in the economy in recent years, including the introduction of the minimum wage. The increased incentive to work must be beneficial to the country and to the quality of life. The Government is to be congratulated on creating some 300,000 new jobs and achieving a major decline in the number of people on the live register.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the free travel scheme. While it is an excellent scheme and greatly facilitates those who are in a position to use it, there are many people in rural areas who have no public transport service. Such people can only get out of their homes with the help of a neighbour or by using a taxi service. I call on the Minister to introduce a transport voucher scheme, to allow a person to have, say, two free trips per week for such purposes as churchgoing or shopping. People need this opportunity to get out of their homes and travel even locally. It would improve their quality of life and the cost would not be great. The resulting flexibility would make it more attractive for people to remain in rural Ireland and help to prevent the current movement of population from the countryside to urban areas.    </P>
    <P>I appeal to the Opposition to try to improve their performance somewhat. Good government needs good opposition. Far too little time of this House is devoted to policy matters. Issues raised by the Opposition since the last recess have included the facilities available to Deputies, an alleged conflict of interest involving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and, this week, the position of the former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. If those are seen as the major problems confronting us, the country is in a much healthier state than I had ever thought possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill. I fully support the call by Deputy Power for an extension of the free travel scheme. We all know of elderly people in <Col N="103" /> remote areas who must use a taxi to get to church or to collect their pensions. Taxi fares take up a considerable percentage of the income of such people. We need a system of transport vouchers or some form of supplementary payment for elderly people living outside of urban areas who are not in a position to avail of free transport. Many elderly people live alone in rural areas and have no immediate family members in the neighbourhood. They should be enabled to travel quite freely without having to worry about the cost of transport.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny has referred to the difficulties of some people who are in receipt of old age pensions from Britain and who have a partial Irish pension. Many such people who had their means assessed recently for Irish pension purposes are now finding their pensions reduced because of the change in the value of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the punt. When sterling was below parity with the punt some years ago, I argued that those people should be compensated on the Irish side. At that time, when Deputy De Rossa was Minister and perhaps also during Deputy Woods' term, the Department adamantly refused to top up the pension to allow for the decline in the value of sterling. It is absolutely appalling that the Department is now punishing people because of the strength of sterling against the Irish punt. The Department should find some other way of saving money, rather than on the pensions of people who are bringing revenue into the country as a result of their hard work abroad over many years.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Coughlan, Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, whose county, like mine, has suffered high emigration, has many similar queries from pensioners. I wish her every success in her new position and I am quite sure she will do an excellent job in that Department as Aire Stáit go dtí mí Meitheamh na bliana seo chugainn.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Government has introduced some very progressive measures, including the highest minimum wage in Europe and increasing the number of places on the back to work scheme by 12,000 to 34,000. This has had a significant impact on the unemployed and those on low wages. Despite achieving the lowest live register figures in recent history, the Government has continued to increase social welfare spending from £4.5 billion in 1997 to more than £6 billion in 2001 &ndash; an increase of more than 33%. The £850 million package announced in the December budget is four times that introduced by Deputy De Rossa when he was Minister for Social Welfare in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases for pensioners are very welcome. I particularly welcome the £10 increase in the old age pension which follows previous increases of £5, £6 and £7. We all remember the meagre increases introduced by the previous Government which were vigorously defended in the House by Deputies Quinn and De Rossa. Fianna Fáil and <Col N="104" /> the Progressive Democrats committed themselves to delivering an old age pension of £100 by 2002 and I am glad a payment of £106 will be realised this year.</P>
    <P>The Government is also set to achieve the £100 target for the lowest rate of social welfare benefits agreed in the PPF. The additional £8 represents a 10% increase in personal rates of social welfare payments. This is a welcome increase which will go a long way to ensuring that those who are unemployed will not be left to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has always had a social democratic ethos and a republican belief that all in society should be adequately catered for. While we will make every effort to involve those in the work force we are committed to ensuring that the unemployed are not forced to live in poverty. Much more needs to be done in the area of social welfare and, over the next 12 to 15 months, the Minister will introduce many worthwhile and positive measures aimed particularly at the less well off.</P>
    <P>The Government's efforts to bring people into the work force have resulted in a change in social welfare spending. In 1997, £1 in every £4 of social welfare expenditure was on unemployment benefits and supports. This figure is now down to £1 in every £7, while more than 30% of unemployment spending assists people to get back to work or to education. These statistics speak for the improvement in the economy over recent years. VTOS and back-to-work allowance schemes are also important and have a high take-up rate, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises that carers are an irreplaceable element of society. The increases in the income disregard for the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person, and from £150 to £250 for a couple, will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. The Minister indicated that more needs to be done in this area and I urge him to further increase the income disregards.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an improvement in the residency requirements for the carer's allowance. Carers used to have to live under the same roof as the person being cared for to qualify for the allowance. Thankfully a more sensible approach is being taken. However, in some cases a daughter or son may live nine or ten miles from their parents yet spend most of the day in their parents' house caring for them and often return at night to check on them. On occasions the Department is too strict as regards this requirement and some leniency should be shown.</P>
    <P>I recently dealt with a case in west Cavan involving a woman who spends the day and most of the night with her mother and then returns to care for her own children in her own home. This woman has been denied the carer's allowance or any sort of assistance. She told me that her mother does not want a home help. Such cases <Col N="105" /> should be examined and some assistance provided.</P>
    <P>I am glad that proper funding for carers goes hand in hand with improvements for those with disabilities. Section 17 provides for the extension of the £6 living alone allowance to recipients of disability allowance, invalidity pension, unemployability supplement and blind person's pension, irrespective of age, with effect from April 2001. I welcome this measure which will be of great benefit to the 10,000 recipients who will qualify for an additional supplement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power referred to the loneliness experienced by many people, particularly those living in rural areas. The Department, particularly through the scheme of voluntary grants, has provided worthwhile assistance to many community groups in urban and rural areas. The Minister has been in County Cavan with me on a number of occasions and has seen at first hand the valuable work carried out by local communities where a new resource or community centre is provided. This has enabled local communities to provide a day care facility where people can have a meal or enjoy an afternoon social event.</P>
    <P>Such day care centres are the only social outlet for many people who look forward to being collected by the bus so they can meet people from their locality and enjoy an afternoon's hospitality and a wholesome, nutritious meal. I hope the Minister will be able to obtain more funding for the scheme of voluntary grants to ensure that other voluntary groups will be able to provide facilities which are so costly and demanding on local communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>We expect these things to happen fairly soon and we look forward to working with the Minister of State. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for the social welfare increases included in the Bill. However, as a member of the Opposition I must also point out some of the deficiencies in the social welfare increases and where the Minister fell down on what he should have done.</P>
      <P>The country is awash with money yet the poor are pushed out and left without adequate payments. For example, how can anyone be asked to survive on unemployment assistance which has increased from £76 to £84? It must be impossible to do so. There is great affluence in the country and it is terrible that we ask people to survive on £84 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> No one has addressed the issue of what will happen when this increase kicks in. I hope the Minister of State will raise this issue with the Minister. Once the increases are introduced, if the recipient lives in a council flat or house, the differential rents system will be reviewed &ndash; and this has started in my county &ndash; and people will pay increased rents because of increases in social welfare payments. As a result, part of the increase they receive will be immediately clawed back.</P>
    <P>If people are living in private rented accommodation and receiving a rent allowance, there will be an immediate claw back as the allowance will be reduced because of the increase in the social welfare benefits. The Minister has failed to address the ceiling limits as regards rent allowances so part of the £8 increase will be clawed back. Even though people are supposed to receive an increase of £8 per week, the reality is it will be a good deal less, and this is not to mention the difficulties caused by inflation.</P>
    <P>We need to bring in the poverty proofing review so that increases in social welfare payments will be real increases. Local authority rents, for example, should not go back to the local authority or money from private rented accommodated should not be clawed back by the health board for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Increases are not being passed on to the recipient as much of them are clawed back. We must have some type of poverty proofing so that people on low incomes are not penalised in that way. Single parents are particularly vulnerable and they get a raw deal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has moved a small way to do something for widows and widowers and I welcome the improvement. However, widows and widowers have got a raw deal from this and successive Governments. We must build in special provisions for them. We all know of cases where a widow or widower is heavily penalised by having to pay additional tax. The tax band which was slowly introduced in recent years is a help but it does not fully compensate for the difficulties involved. It seems ridiculous that someone on a middle income, such as a garda or a factory worker, should pay additional tax because his or her wife or husband dies and he or she is left with two or three children. That is horrendous. They get a raw deal in this State. While the Minister has gone some of the way, I hope he goes further and I would support him in that.</P>
    <P>As regards family income supplement, only 15,000 people take it up. Yet Revenue officials will say more people should qualify for it and that there is not a full take-up of the scheme. We must review it and see what can be done. At a time when there is good employment but also a great deal of poverty and commitments to rent and mortgages, the Minister should increase the rates by more than £25. The income ceiling for a person with one child is £258. This is increased by £20 to £278 for someone with two children. That is the borderline of people's earnings. Some £300 or £330 is a great deal of money for many people <Col N="107" /> with two children. I hope every effort is made to increase it.</P>
    <P>Child benefit was mentioned. Like me, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Coughlan, will not believe that the Minister quoted the child benefit figures which will be in place in 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>He should come back to the real world. Deputy Power also mentioned child benefit. The officials in the Department must be tired listening to me complaining about the fact that first and second children get a particular rate of child benefit, while the third and subsequent children get another rate. Why are there different rates for different children? </P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should more money be paid in child benefit for the third and subsequent children compared to first and second children? I was the youngest of ten children. I do not know what year the half crowns, as my mother used to call them, were introduced. When my older brother, who was five years older than me, came of age, I was the last one for which she received payment. However, they would not pay for one child. It was ten bob at that time and my mother thought it was great. As I was the last child on my own, I was pushed out. I can see first and second children, who were the love children, growing up with a grudge because they were badly treated in that they did not receive the same treatment as the third and fourth child. I am sure a good writer will write an essay in the future on deprived first and second children. I am sure it would be interesting and funny. However, this brings to our attention the need to treat all children equally, which is important.</P>
      <P>We pay one and a half times the rate of child benefit for twins and double the amount for triplets. There is a view that all multiple births should be treated the same and that double the amount should be paid. Twins should therefore get twice the rate of child benefit. In a time of affluence, we should move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tired drawing attention to another anomaly in our social welfare system but nothing has been done about it. We do not treat our children equally when it comes to payments. Depending on who one's parents are, the child dependent allowance could be £13.20, £15 or £17 a week. If <Col N="108" /> a couple on social welfare have three children, one child could be worth £13.20, the next child could be worth £15 and the third child could be worth £17. How ridiculous is that? A widow will get an allowance of £17 a week for each child. A person on an invalidity pension or an old age contributory pension with dependent children will get £15 a week for each child. However, a person on unemployment benefit or disability allowance will only get £13.20 a week for each child. It is time to change that and to treat all children equally.</P>
    <P>The payment should be increased to £17 for all children. I hope the Minister does not say the poverty review, which was done three or four years ago, stated that this would be seen as a disincentive to work. That has gone out the door because that review was done before the back to work allowance scheme was introduced. If a person is on the back to work allowance scheme, the payments are reflected in social welfare where the increased rates would also apply. The Minister should not use that as an excuse. We must change those rates. The only reason he will not do so is that it will cost money because he will not be able to reduce the payments. He will have to increase them all to £17 and the bulk of them are currently receiving £13.20. However, there are sufficient funds to do that.</P>
    <P>The meanest thing I have seen in a long time is in this Bill. I am disgusted, although not surprised, at the way the Government has slipped it in. It is mean, low and affects about 400,000 people who I hope will be aware of it. In section 8, the PRSI ceiling will go from £26,500 to £28,250 for the coming year. The PRSI ceiling is rising year after year and we welcome that. To date, however, employees whose incomes reached those thresholds got a PRSI holiday for that part of the year when their incomes were in excess of the PRSI ceiling. The Minister of State might take note that in the tax year 1999-2000, some 340,000 people availed of this PRSI holiday and, therefore, it is a fairly substantial issue for many people. The average benefit they received was £300,000. The current tax year, which runs from April to December, is a shortened one with only 38 weeks. What has the Government done? All personal and PRSI allowances are allowable at 74%. We all have to say that is fair, but what has the Government done with the PRSI ceiling? Nothing. The PRSI ceiling stays as a full year rate at £28,250.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>That is mean, small-minded and deceptive. The Government has done it because it sees an easy target and wants to slip this measure in without anyone noticing it. On budget day, the Minister for Finance announced that all allowances would be given at the 74% rate, but he did not say a word about the PRSI ceiling which he announced would be at £28,250. That will become an issue. It is a handy one for social welfare because I estimate the Department is collecting about £130 million from it. I may be wrong but according to the figures I have calculated from replies to parliamentary questions, the Department must be collecting approximately that sum. The Minister should examine that matter carefully and do something about it.</P>
      <P>Carers are the great unsung heroes in our society. According to the Carers' Society there are about 120,000 of them, but the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs puts the figure at around 55,000. No matter what the real figure is, the Department pays a few shillings to 17,000 carers at most. Therefore, on its own admission the Department pays only 30% of its own total figure for carers. The remaining 70% of carers that the Department recognises receive nothing. Carers look after people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which equals 168 hours per week. They receive £88 which equals about 50p an hour. It is an absolute disgrace. We give them some benefits, including free travel but where can one go in Westmeath or Donegal with a free travel pass? The person the carer is looking after is probably in a wheelchair unable to access public transport. Carers cannot travel on their own because the free travel passes are not much use.</P>
      <P>Let us go back to the idea put forward by one of the Minister's colleagues, which is to provide travel vouchers. In that way, carers could use taxis if they wished. The precedent is there, because we already subsidise people living on islands for travel purposes. They are allowed to use special subsidies for flights in and out of the islands, so why not give limited free travel vouchers to carers for taxis? At least that would be of some use to them. As it now stands, the free travel system is not of much use to most people. The Government is paying CIE a flat rate per travel pass but carers have no use for it because the service is not there. Let us do something about looking after carers. We also have to review how close carers are living to the person they are caring for and what care they are providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many carers who are looking after people day and night. Some carers, who have <Col N="110" /> been identified as such by the Department, are not getting a shilling. In this time of affluence, the Department should provide them with a once-off respite payment so they can have a little break. Currently, the respite is only payable to those who receive the allowance. The other 34,000 that the Department recognises as carers receive nothing. They should all receive a respite payment, tested on medical grounds only, so they can have a break.</P>

      <P>This Bill will go down in history. In 30 or 40 years time when people talk about the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, they will remember him as the man who gave £100 a week to pensioners. He is putting his name into the history books, and not just with regard to this legislation. The Bill will be remembered for a long time by pensioners who appreciate the improvements made in their payments.</P>
      <P>In the few years I have been a Member of the House, I have tested public opinion after each budget to see what people think of the increases in my own village of Castletown, County Laois. Generally, they say &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; or &ldquo;It's not very much&rdquo;. Following last year's budget, however, the reaction was outstanding. People genuinely appreciated the £10 per week increase in old age pensions. It was something we had promised in the general election campaign and while people did not think we would do it, we have delivered on it and we still have another budget to go. The only factor that will make the £100 per week pension short-lived in the public mind is that when we come to next year's social welfare increases on 1 January 2002 they will be payable in euros. We will be looking at a weekly pension of 140 or 150 euros, depending on the level of increase. The £100 pension will thus be forgotten, although it is a milestone in pensioners' lives today.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the carer's allowance. I am pleased at the big increase in the income disregards for a single person who is a carer, which rises from £75 to £150 per week. That is a generous and substantial increase. We could do more, but it must be recognised that we are making progress in this area. I will continue to keep pressure on the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to ensure they go further in the budget later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a couple, the income disregard rises from £125 to £250 a week which will result in more than £5,000 new carers coming into the system this year. Based on current information regarding the new income disregard figure, up to 3,000 carers will receive increased payments. When we came into Government, between 8,000 and 9,000 people were in receipt of the carer's allowance. As a result of the new measures, I <Col N="111" /> expect the figure will exceed 20,000 in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I appeal to social welfare officers to be more flexible in their approach to dealing with the carer's allowance and case after case has been cited in this House. Deputy Smith spoke about the position in Cavan and the position is the same in County Laois. In cases were sons and daughters care for their elderly parents for hours on end every day, a social welfare officer will make an assessment that such care does not constitute full-time care because at some hour of the day one or other of the carers return to his or her home. A telephone connection between the two houses concerned was allowed in last year's Bill, which indicated there was a direct line in communication and the person concerned was continually available or on call. While that rule was introduced, the Department was slow to publicise it with the result that many people did not know about it. I hope this year more easily readable information on this allowance will be published and made available to the people concerned at a much earlier stage than on previous occasions. When there is good news in this area, there is an onus on all of us to ensure the general public are fully informed about it.</P>
    <P>A family with two children on an income of up to £15,000 will qualify for the maximum carer's allowance and families with two children on an income of up to £25,000, which while not substantial is a reasonable income, will qualify for the minimum amount of the carer's allowance. They will also be entitled to the free schemes and the respite grants, which have increased from £300 to £400. Where a carer is caring for two elderly people or two disabled people, he or she will be entitled to a respite grant of £800 in any one year, which is a significant payment.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance benefit must be dovetailed with the carer's leave scheme, which is provided for in the Carer's Leave Bill brought forward by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Second Stage of which was taken in this House two weeks ago. A great effort has been made to dovetail the two schemes. That is probably one of the reasons the Carer's Leave Bill was slow to get off the ground. I am aware of cases in my constituency where people knew this scheme was due to be introduced and applied for carer's benefit, but their application for carer's leave has not yet been approved. Some transition measures need to be introduced. As more than 200 people are affected by this transition arrangement, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs should work with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make sure their applications are properly considered and that they are granted carer's leave. I appreciate that the carer's leave is a matter for another Department, but the two schemes are interlinked.</P>
    <P>The public are confused about carer's entitlements. There is the carer's allowance scheme, the <Col N="112" /> new carer's benefit scheme, to which carers who leave their jobs will be entitled, the carer's leave scheme, which guarantees a carer the right to return to his or her job if he or she has taken 15 months leave from it, and the carer's tax free allowance and the income tax code. We need to ensure those schemes are dovetailed, as the public are confused about them. I ask that the schemes be co-ordinated to ensure there are no glitches along the way.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the increases in child benefit, which have increased by £25 per week. I see nothing wrong with the Government stating it has a programme to increase this benefit from £42.50 up to approximately £90 in two years' time. There is nothing wrong in it publicising its long-term intentions. The increase in the benefit goes a long way towards meeting that target. I am also pleased about the increase in maternity leave benefit and adoptive leave benefit.</P>
    <P>Given that many social welfare recipients are old age pensioners, they will be confused when they get their increases in benefit on 1 January next year. The Department will have to ensure that old people understand the new currency when it is given in their pension books or bank accounts. That is an issue on which we will have to concentrate and to which special attention must be paid.</P>
    <P>With regard to the child dependant allowance, I refer particularly to cases where a family is in receipt of unemployment assistance or farm assistance and receives an adult dependent allowance of £13.20. I received a letter today from the Minister in response to a matter I raised with him concerning this allowance. The reply states that child benefit is payable up to the age of 18 years of age, but where the claimant is in receipt of a long-term allowance, such as those I mentioned, it will be paid where children are in full-time education up the age of 22 or the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. As children are now starting school at the age of five and given the introduction of the transition year, I am aware of many cases in County Laois where students have not completed their primary degree before they reach the age of 23. In such cases where families are on farm assistance, they lose more than £600 per annum in benefit. I, therefore, ask that the age of entitlement be increased to allow the students concerned to complete their primary degrees. We do not want the age of entitlement to be extended indefinitely, but a poverty trap has been created in this instance with students completing the final year of their primary degrees when they are over the age of 22. I ask that this matter be addressed.</P>
    <P>The free schemes, such as the free telephone rental allowance scheme, are very good. I have had detailed discussions on this matter with the Minister and I am aware that work has been done in regard to the free telephone rental allowance scheme. The free scheme should be extended as urgently as possible to people who opt to use a mobile phone, as it is easier for people to carry a <Col N="113" /> mobile phone upstairs, downstairs, out to the garden and on their person, especially if they need to contact people, rather than an Eircom fixed line. As Eircom is privatised, it should not be given a privileged position. Free allowances must be available to telecommunications operators in general and not only to Eircom.</P>
    <P>A number of old age pensioners have asked me to raise with the Minister if it would be feasible for the scope of the free schemes to be extended to include the dog licence fee. As the saying goes, a dog is man's best friend. The only regular companion many old people have is a dog. That request may seem trivial, but for many an old age pensioners the only friend around the house most days of the week is his friendly dog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Department on the extra expenditure of 15%, £850 million, in social welfare payments. The total spend of the Department of £6 billion is very impressive and has rocketed in recent years.</P>
      <P>Many people thought the commitment given in 1997 that we would reach the target of £100 in old age pension benefit within the life of this Government was a wild promise, but three and a half years later that target has been passed. The £28 increase in the old age pension is tremendous. The Pensions Board's policy is to increase the old age pension benefit to 34% of the average industrial wage and good progress has been made on reaching that target in recent years. The benefit is 31% of the average industrial wage, and only three more percentage points need to be given to reach the target figure of 34%. The benefit has increased by 3% or 4% in the past three or four years, which must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>There are a few provisions in the Bill that are marvellous. The increase to qualified adults, particularly the £25 increase in benefit to a pensioner couple over the age of 66 who share an old age pension book, did not come across very clearly on budget day. That increase is going down extremely well. Many years ago the increase in benefit for such a couple was approximately £6, usually for the man, and £1.50 or £2 for the spouse, usually the woman. It is great to see that role reversed and that the increase is £10 for the applicant or the person qualified and £15 for the spouse. That is a tremendous turnaround. It is a real boost and it has been very much welcomed by women over the age 66 who never got a tosser from the State and who now feel all their years of work in the home is being recognised. It is great to hear that the Department will carry on this policy over the new few years and bring the benefit payment of the spouse up to the level of the non-contributory pension rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approve of many other things, such as the living alone allowance for people on invalidity or disability benefit. Deputy McGrath spoke of his mean point, and similarly I have one little snag or problem. I wonder about the case of a widow of a person who was killed at work. Historically, such <Col N="114" /> a person received about £17 as a top-up. A very mean interpretation was put on that in recent years, which meant that only a person under 66 received the top-up. When the widow passed the age of 66, the top-up was severely eaten into. I thought the Minister had committed to restoring it. I would specifically like to know if a widow over 66 who receives this top-up will get an increase of £12.90 this year, will she recover the £8 she lost in the past few years, or will the top-up be further eaten into?</P>
    <P>The increases in child benefit are so enormous that I worry birth rates might start to rocket. I am nervous of how the Minister's generosity might be interpreted in certain quarters. I wonder if the Government missed an opportunity to tax child benefit, and to give more money to poor people who need it. The increases have been considerable, but like Deputy McGrath I fail to see the logic behind giving more money for the third and fourth child. If the Department is nervous about taking the blame for that, it can say that all parties in the Dáil Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs recommended the higher benefit go for the first child.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the booklet that comes out every year from the Conference of Religious of Ireland, who are a great organisation. Father Seán Healy and Sister Bridget Callaghan do great work, although they are a little sensitive at times. I value their yearly critique which has good information, even if I may not agree with it all. It is funny that 33 years after the issue of Humanae Vitae, the poor and disadvantaged have discovered birth control, according to Father Seán's critique. His examples this year seem to refer to lone parents with only one child, whereas in previous years he spoke of a lone parent with four children or a couple with 17 children. This year, when the benefit goes to the third child and subsequent children, his examples have just one child. Computer programmes will give answers based on what is put in, so I hope Father Seán will not be too annoyed when I point out that it is a bit rich.</P>
    <P>It is great that unemployment figures are down, but there are still long-term unemployed. If the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment cannot solve the problem now, it never will. There is no logic in cutting back on the number of community employment schemes when people in my constituency are on the dole. Every unemployed person should be hassled by the Department into finding a job or a place on a scheme, even if they are seen as unemployable.</P>
    <P>Community employment is vital, which is why the consultant's report which recommended a cut in the number of CE schemes is crazy. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will have to exert itself and get more CE schemes for people in disadvantaged areas. If there is a problem in filling CE schemes in well-to-do parts of the country, so be it. Many people in other regions want them, and people should be pushed on to them. It galls me when I hear of <Col N="115" /> men in the 59 to 63 year old age bracket being told that they cannot go on a scheme because they are too old, their chance has gone and that they should sit at home where their children can see them with nothing to do. It is a crazy problem which should be addressed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, who should take on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>This Department's CDP programmes are not the worst, but I represent constituencies that are being examined and planned almost to death. Every Minister is throwing around money that could be better directed. I wish more money was given to helping people to work and find jobs. Even some departmental CDP schemes could be looked at more critically. It should not be a case of employing activists and college students who are studying the poor. We would be better off to directly employ the poor, to give them a few bob to cut grass or do something.</P>
    <P>There are too many programmes under this Government, although this Department is not the worst. Several other Ministers and their Departments examine and plan to death without directly targeting those who need help. More responsibility should be put on people to make a few shillings rather than their area being further studied and examined. I am sick and tired of looking at reports which seem to go around in circles, getting nowhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for giving way, and I will share time with him. I welcome many aspects of the Social Welfare Bill. For many years, those in need have not had the opportunity to obtain the funds they deserve. The Minister highlighted the fact that pensions have gone up significantly in recent years. It has to be remembered it is at a time when inflation is militating against pensioners, who are the people who saved this country in times of difficulty. Some left the country and others are coming back, and they are welcome, but many of those who are on pensions today went through extremely difficult times. While £8 might be welcome, it is certainly not over-generous today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often spoken of those on disability, who have been left behind with regard to payments. For a number of years they got much lower payments than pensioners, including non-contributory pensioners. The disabled often need more heat, among other things, because of their condition. At a time of reasonable wealth in the State, when there are billions of pounds that the Minister hardly knows what to do with, it is hard to justify leaving the disabled behind with regard to payments and militating against them in other <Col N="116" /> ways. Some disabled people, who are unable to drive because of legal technicalities &ndash; this applies to all branches of Government &ndash; are denied the disabled driver's allowance for VRT and Vat. I know of one woman who lost a leg and was living in the family home next door to her son who was caring for her. After initially being given it, the allowance was cancelled on the technicality that the son did not live with her under the same roof. This family could have behaved differently. Another son who lived with his mother might have bought a car and claimed the allowance. They wished to be honest and the one who cared for the mother made the claim. This area must be re-examined at a time of considerable wealth in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement mentioned the number of people who have been included since he took up office. Immediately before he came into Government, there was an increase in the number of people who had been disallowed and the allowance was only increased this year from £150 to £250. We must ensure that people who need it get the allowance and the care. There are different levels of need. Those with the greatest claim, who have to care for a patient on a 24 hour basis, must be treated sympathetically.</P>
    <P>A widow, who cares for the parent of a dead spouse, may have received the allowance while the spouse was alive but lost it on his death. She only gets the widow's pension. This could happen to widowers also. This is discrimination and must be re-examined.</P>
    <P>The increase in family income supplement is welcome for those on PAYE and PRSI but the area of self-employment must be reconsidered. Small shopkeepers and other self-employed people have to close their businesses to get social welfare payments. The system lacks compassion and understanding. Previous Ministers have stated that they would not accept the accountancy figures produced by these small business people. That is an indictment of the system. If a person, self-employed or not, produces figures to prove his earnings are such as to make him eligible for the income supplement, he should get it.</P>
    <P>The situation with farm assistance is farcical. It was introduced to maintain family farm incomes when the BSE crisis first hit. The figures show that fewer people receive farm assistance than received the earlier farm support, as small farm dole. Taking into account those who have changed over for technical reasons from widow's or other allowances, there may be less available under the farm assistance scheme. This Minister must examine his conscience in the light of the new BSE crisis and deal with farm income problems.</P>
    <P>A constituent approached me yesterday seeking a medical card. His family was receiving payments under the farm assistance scheme. The problem was this: their daughter had to pay £52 to enter an exam and he could not afford it. There is a crisis in the small, private, non-PAYE farming sector. The Minister must examine this before <Col N="117" /> it is too late and make the necessary changes in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare package is increased by £850 million with a total estimated spend of £5.5 billion. This is a huge allocation of money. It is important that the date for increased social welfare payment has been brought forward to coincide with the beginning of the tax year, and next year it will coincide with the calendar year. The previous practice was that payments might not have been brought in up to six months later.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that only 5,000 extra people will receive the carer's allowance and 3,000 existing carers will benefit from the changes in the means test. It is estimated that there are 120,000 family carers in poor circumstances. Carers do valuable work which must be recognised.</P>
      <P>The increase in respite grants from £300 to £400 is inadequate. This a seven day a week job involving huge commitment. The £800 for those caring for two or more people is not enough. This works out as payment below the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated to foster care, £9 million, was small. People give dedicated service to health boards in this area and considerable additional money could have been allocated to it.</P>
      <P>Another issue of concern is child poverty. It was recommended that child benefit should be increased to £100 per child per month. This amount is necessary given the cost of child care. The elimination of child poverty is one of the objectives of the strategy in this area. Ireland has one of the highest levels of child poverty and that does not reflect well on people's opinion of the economy. This matter must be addressed in future budgets. Carers also must cope with huge ordeals in the context of child poverty.</P>
      <P>Many people on the minimum wage still pay tax. The budget was geared towards people on higher incomes. People earning £4.40 an hour or £176 a week still pay tax and this must be examined. Those at the upper end of the scale received an additional £1,000 tax saving, but people at the lower end, who are rearing children, are still paying tax. This issue must be considered.</P>
      <P>People with disabilities should be in a position to employ personal assistants. I have met several groups in relation to this important matter. The adoption of my suggestion would create a huge saving for the State and the Minister must ensure that funds allocated to health boards are ring-fenced in this area. The employment of personal assistants would enable disabled people maintain their independence at home. The allocation for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities is another important matter. While I welcome many aspects of the budget, it is important that funding is ring-fenced in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated spend of approximately £5.5 billion is huge, but many people are still unhappy. This puts a question mark over the entire allocation and the value for money likely to be achieved. The Minister must ensure a large <Col N="118" /> uptake of the funds and that people in need benefit. An extra £850 million has been provided, which is double the amount allocated last year. However, money does not solve all problems and administration is an important aspect.</P>
    <P>As an employer, another matter of concern is the decision to impose a further PRSI cost of £159 million on businesses. This is unnecessary and unwarranted and it has created acrimony where harmony is needed. The decision to remove the ceiling on employers' PRSI has rendered the entire PRSI system grossly inequitable, complex and unnecessarily costly to administer. A complete overhaul of the PRSI system, aimed at a significant reduction in employer rates and the abolition of the 2% employers' health levy, is required.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the decision to remove the ceiling on employers and self-employed PRSI contributions. The decision will impose a further cost of £159 million on businesses. Employers' contributions to the social insurance fund rose from 47% to 74% between 1987 and 2000 while employees' PRSI contributions to the fund have fallen in line with reductions in employment taxation. At the same time, the Government contribution has fallen from 30% to zero. One must ask why the private sector is funding almost the entire social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>As an employer, my view is that the Minister must maintain a competitive tax/PRSI structure relative to our competitors, particularly in the UK. The number of insurance classes must be reduced because the current structure is very complex. It consists of a range of rates and benefits and the number of classes of PRSI contributions should be rationalised. For example, there are nine sub-classes in the class A PRSI contributions code. The system needs a root and branch examination.</P>
    <P>The health levy does not confer any extra entitlement on those who pay it and does not remove any entitlement from those who do not pay it. Levies are not part of the tax simplification process and the Government no longer needs to raise tax in this manner. The 2% health levy is a taxation on employment. The exemption limits also pose a significant poverty trap for employees as their gross income increases and goes over the threshold. The net income demand decreases by 2%, thereby putting pressure on wages. The sum of £490 million is raised by the health levy, but, despite the buoyancy of the economy at present, people on the minimum wage are still in the tax net.</P>
    <P>If the health levy is a tax, it should be integrated into the PAYE contribution and not dealt with separately. If the levy is not a tax and the moneys raised are no longer required, it should be abolished. The Government's budget figure was more than £3 billion and the health levy is not justified in such circumstances. I ask the Minister to clarify the future role of the health levy and the Government's plans in that regard. It is a taxation on employment and it does not give <Col N="119" /> any benefit to those who pay it. Those who do not pay it have the same entitlements. If it is a tax, it should be specified as such and not a levy because it does not provide any benefits.</P>

      <P>In common with other Members, I wholeheartedly welcome the many improvements in the Bill and I compliment the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. In common with other Members, over the years I have made representations to the Minister on behalf of widows and widowers. I am delighted the Minister has made a significant improvement in this area this year. The important point is that the Minister listens to the views of Members not only at budget time, but throughout the year. He takes our views into consideration and goes to some lengths to accommodate our opinions. The Bill is probably the most practical example in that regard.</P>
      <P>Members of the House deal with people in their constituencies daily and they bring views back to respective Ministers as to what should be included in the budget and the improvements that should be made. Thankfully, many of those improvements sought have been included. Many improvements will not be made and it is important that things said in this debate on the Bill will be taken into consideration at a future date.</P>
      <P>We are in a position in which we can make significant changes due to our sound economic situation. That did not happen overnight either, but was brought about by much hard work and commitment on the part of politicians who seldom get much credit for that.</P>
      <P>The Bill is to be welcomed wholeheartedly for the many ways it helps those members of society most in need. It builds on the Government's significant achievements in this regard since coming to office in 1997. If the performance of any Government or society were judged it would be on how we treat the weakest in society. Thankfully, in a time of plenty, regardless of how well the economy might forge ahead, the weaker people in society have not been forgotten and that has been the record of Fianna Fáil and of Fianna Fáil led Governments over many years. They have introduced many benefits and, though people like to demonise people like Charlie Haughey, the things he did in the 70s are relevant to people today. One hears that from the ordinary people. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is someone who has listened and is prepared to put into practice the points put to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures such as introducing the highest minimum wage in Europe and increasing the number of places on the back to work schemes by 12,000 <Col N="120" /> to 34,000 have made a significant impact on people previously unemployed or working for low wages. I return to a point made by my colleague, Deputy Ahern, when he referred to community employment schemes. Although it is probably the responsibility of another Department these schemes are worthy and benefit many voluntary groups and organisations throughout the length and breadth of the country. I ask for the continuation of these schemes even in modified form. They will always be necessary, though perhaps they are not required to the same extent today as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>Despite achieving the lowest live register figures in recent history the Government has continued to increase resources spent on social welfare. Spending has increased massively from £4.5 billion in 1997 to more than £6 billion in 2001. That is an increase of one third in just over four years. That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>If we were to bury our heads in the sand or if the Government got carried away with the booming, tiger economy we could forget about people and keep the social welfare budget static. However, we have not done that. We have increased it massively over the years. Obviously, if there are fewer people to pull from the social welfare budget, then those on social welfare will benefit most.</P>
    <P>The £850 million package provided by the Government in budget 2001 for social welfare improvements is more than twice the size of last year's social welfare package and four times greater than that of the Rainbow Coalition Government in 1997. We hear criticism and it is no harm that we remember that fact.</P>
    <P>This means that people dependent on social welfare will benefit, this year, from increases of between 10% to 18% which, in itself, allowing for inflation, is a massive increase. This Bill highlights the Government's continuing commitment to those in society who depend on social welfare payments for a decent quality of life. Thank God we have reached that stage today.</P>
    <P>In relation to pensioners, the increases provided in sections 4 and 5 deliver on our commitments. I welcome the increase of £10 in the old age pensions. This follows previous increases of £5, £6 and £7. I compare this to the meagre increases of between £1.50 and £3 delivered by the Rainbow Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>We committed ourselves to delivering an old age pension of £100 by 2002. This Bill sees that target achieved and pensions brought up to £106. This is only correct and proper. When everyone seems to benefit it is right that those that have given long service to the country for small wages over many years would be recognised. The Government has certainly done that.</P>
    <P>We are also on target to achieve the £100 target set out in the PPF for the lowest rates of social welfare benefit. The £8 or 10% increase in personal rates of social welfare payments are welcome and will go a long way toward ensuring that <Col N="121" /> those who find themselves out of work will not be left to fend for themselves. Fianna Fáil has always had a democratic ethos, a republican belief that all in society should be cared for and all are equal. While we make every effort to involve people in the work force we are committed to ensuring that those that find themselves unemployed are not forced to live in poverty.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to bring people into the work force has seen spending on social welfare change from the situation where, in 1997, we spent £1 in every £4 of total social welfare expenditure on employment and on employment supports. Today the figure is down to £1 in every £7, while more than 30% of employment and unemployment spending goes to helping people to return to work and education.</P>
    <P>As chairman of a vocational educational committee, I commend the Minister on the many initiatives taken on a constant basis. The Minister's Department over-laps with many other Departments and if I had more time I would say something about that, as the improvements the Minister has brought about in his Department are sometimes not matched with the same urgency in other Departments. I mention the Department of Education and Science and, in particular, the Department of Health and Children and, through our county councils, the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Government taking office, spending on child benefits stood at £397 million annually. Increases provided for in this Bill bring spending in 2001 to £761 million, almost double the 1997 figure. The monthly rate for the first two children has been increased by £25 and the monthly rate for third and subsequent children has been increased by £30. This is greater than the increases provided in the last six budgets. The increases of £25 and £30 are in contrast to the measly £1 and £5 provided by Deputy Quinn in his last two budgets as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This year's budget must be judged on a range of packets but one of the best decisions the Minister and the Government made on this occasion was ensuring that this major increase went in the direction it did. There were others who hoped and wished it would go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>These increases will make it easier for parents and families where the costs of raising a family in the present environment can be off-putting. Carers are an important part of society and the Bill recognises that. The increase in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. This is a logical step and one the Minister might examine in the future for further improvements.</P>
    <P>There is over crowding in many of our hospitals. There are people staying in long-stay acute beds costing significant amounts of money and we pay subventions to people in nursing homes. If it were attractive enough one would <Col N="122" /> find that more people would care for their relatives at home. The way to make it more attractive is to try to improve the means test and to try to improve the level of payments.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has annoyed me lately is that, every time we increase a subvention to a patient in a nursing home it is immediately taken by the nursing home. That crosses over to the Department of Health and Children but all these issues are interlinked and it is important that we go in this direction and that we improve on that.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years Fianna Fáil has steered the economy to its present position as the strongest economy in Europe. However, we have not lost sight of those who are vulnerable and our primary aim is to ensure that everyone feels part of society and is allowed to lead a good quality life. I congratulate the Minister for his work in reforming and improving our social welfare system. In only four years he has gone a long way to achieving a social welfare system that went from one that simply compensates people for economic failure to one that helps people to help themselves. We are helping people to return to the workforce in a way that has never been tried. We are caring for older people, children, carers and people with disabilities to a standard never previously achieved. Fianna Fáil will continue to improve the quality of life of all our people, especially the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I thank and congratulate the Minister and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this excellent Bill. It is a declaration of the way in which resources are to be directed as never before towards meeting the needs of the poor, the underprivileged and the aged.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for increases in the rates of social insurance and social assistance payments and child benefit, improvements to the family income supplement scheme and the duration of maternity and adoptive benefit by four weeks. It also provides for the changes in PRSI announced in the budget, including a reduction in the rates of contributions payable by employees and the self-employed, an increase in the annual earnings ceilings for employee social insurance contributions, for optional contributions and the abolition of the earnings-income ceilings for both employers' and self-employment contributions.</P>
      <P>The Bill is about spreading wealth and supporting the weak. In this the fourth Social Welfare Bill of the Government, we have witnessed tremendous progress being made in this area. Like my colleague, Deputy Aylward, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Ahern, who has shown himself to be a caring Minister.</P>
      <P>There is a substantial increase in the rate of old age pension. Over four budgets, the basic rate for old age pensioners has been increased by £28, an increase of 36% in four years and well above the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> The budget supported families. The family is the key element in society. The provision of a decent and comfortable quality of life into old age is a fundamental entitlement. A person's worth does not end in retirement. The budget focused on support for people with disabilities and carers. It provided, in total, for additional social welfare expenditure of £850 million, four times the level provided for by the rainbow Government in its last year in office. The budget provided for the most substantial increases in child benefit since its introduction in the form of children's allowance. This is only the first of three increases which will see investment rise by £1 billion by 2003, almost a threefold increase.</P>
    <P>In the budget an increase in child benefit was announced of £25 per month for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent children, payable from June 2001. In this the first of three increases, a family with four children will receive over £300 per month or over £70 per week in child benefit. These increases will be payable to all families &ndash; those who choose to go out to work and use paid child care, those with informal child care arrangements and those who choose to work in the home and care for their children in that way. From June, a full three months earlier than usual, 532,000 families with a total of over one million children will benefit from the support the Government will provide through the enhanced child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the school meals community programme is being increased from £100,000 to £300,000 per year. This programme was launched by the Minister last September, which shows his initiative. It provides for 100% funding of food costs for meals in established community schools and projects providing breakfast clubs, lunches and after school meals. Sixteen projects are being funded with over 2,000 children benefiting from this excellent programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that maternity leave will be extended to a total of 26 weeks, including 18 weeks paid leave. Provision is being made for an additional four weeks maternity benefit which will also be available to adoptive parents. The minimum maternity and adoptive benefit is to be increased by £8, bringing the maximum rate to £183 per week, an increase of over £10 per week.</P>
    <P>A total of 10,000 recipients of disability payments are to receive an additional allowance, as are 15,000 carers. In last year's budget we welcomed the extension of the free schemes to all those aged 75 years and over, regardless of income. I welcome the provision in this year's budget whereby the free schemes have been extended to all those over 70 years of age. This recognises the major contribution of older people in society.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance scheme has been extended by two weeks. It will now be paid from the first week in October to late April. I appeal for a <Col N="124" /> further extension of the scheme which is of tremendous benefit to the elderly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the easing of the means test for the fuel allowance. To date, those in receipt of contributory pensions such as retirement pension or widow's contributory pension qualified for the fuel allowance if their income from other sources was not greater than £30 per week. This is being increased to £40 per week from the beginning of the next fuel season in October. This will be much appreciated.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the new carer's benefit scheme which is extremely beneficial to those carers who experience tremendous difficulties in caring and working full time. The scheme, which was introduced last October, allows carers to leave the workforce for up to 15 months and receive a payment which is not means tested. A unique feature of the scheme is the retention of the carer's employment rights for the period in question.</P>
    <P>Carer's allowance is subject to a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his or her partner is assessable. The current applicable figures for disregards are £75 per week for a single carer and £150 for the joint means of a couple. These figures have now been increased. A single person can have an income disregard of £125 and a couple a joint income disregard of £250. This measure will increase the payment of almost 3,000 recipients of carers' allowance. It will also ensure an additional 5,000 carers will qualify for a payment. The measure will come into effect in April 2001 at a cost of £80 million, a huge increase in expenditure on carers.</P>
    <P>The respite care grant, which was increased last year from £200 to £300, is being increased to £400 this year. The increase will come into force in June 2001 and will benefit those in receipt of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and carers caring for a person in receipt of constant attendance allowance or prescribed relative's allowance. The total allocated in 2001 for carer's allowance is over £100 million.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for an easement of the qualifying conditions for the benefit to deal with situations where a carer is on leave from his or her employment in the three month period immediately prior to claiming the benefit. It is estimated that there could eventually be in the region of 6,800 in receipt of carer's benefit, but it must be recognised that it will take a number of years for the scheme to reach maturity.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the removal of the limitation on income support payable to a couple in receipt of disability allowance. The overall amount paid, where a married couple claim certain payments, may not exceed the personal rate plus the increase for the qualified adult. This measure will abolish the limitation on disability allowance with any other social welfare income support scheme. A total of 1,000 recipients will benefit from this measure by between £17.30 and £31.50 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> Section 17 provides for the extension of the £6 living alone allowance to recipients of disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension, irrespective of age, with effect from April 2001. It is estimated that 10,000 recipients will qualify for the additional supplement. The overall increase for this group, when account is taken of the general increase of £8 per week, will be £14 per week.</P>
    <P>Section 13 introduces a number of improvements to the means test for social assistance payments, including the disregard for the purposes of means assessment under any social assistance scheme of income received by a claimant by way of an allowance for the boarding out by a health board of frail elderly persons. Section 20 provides for a change in the assessment of maintenance payments under the one parent family payment scheme.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister who has shown himself to be a caring Minister. The initiatives he has introduced in the past four years are a credit to him and I trust that the budget in October will be successful from his point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>I welcome some of the measures provided for in the Bill. I am not a person who comes into the House only to criticise; I offer constructive criticism in a number of areas. I hope the Minister will take such criticism in the spirit in which it is made because I know how important social welfare continues to be for a number of families. When my father was out of work, my family depended upon it and I have always been aware of its importance as a result.</P>
      <P>I am amused by the plethora of praise because CORI had something different to say, not just about the Minister's area but on the budget as a whole. To be fair, it may have concentrated more on areas other than the Minister's. One group of people about whom I am concerned is widows and widowers. The non-contributory pension has increased from £77 to £85.50, an increase of about £8, and the contributory pension has increased from £81 to £89. The recipients are badly done by, especially at what is a vulnerable time in their lives. It is a meagre amount of money on which to try to survive. If any of us had to survive on it, we would not last too long. Apart from the amount, it is the vulnerability which is the key issue, and widows and widowers express that. Another area is allowances where a widow or widower is under 66 and his or her spouse did not qualify for allowances. That is an area we should reform. Free travel and various allowances should be given to widows and widowers at a point in their lives when they need every crutch and support the State can give them. It can be an emotionally difficult time for widows and widowers and we are not doing enough to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister examine their situation in the context of the next budget? I am aware there are areas upon which the Minister will concentrate <Col N="126" /> such as child benefit, something I appreciate. He is right to focus upon it because it is money which goes directly to mothers, and all the various reports advocated that. Mothers have used it very well to support their children. As someone who comes from a large family, I remember that the first Tuesday of the month was looked forward to because various small items could be purchased for school going children. It is very important and I welcome the focus on it. Nonetheless, will the Minister consider the extension of the free schemes to widows and widowers under the qualifying age? It may cost about £35 million &ndash; I stand to be corrected &ndash; but it is something upon which to focus.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is the first benefit people receive upon applying to the Minister's Department. For many people in rural areas, the first place to put it is often up behind the holy picture or whatever and they might never take it down again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever type of picture. I do not say what I said in a disparaging way. The Minister knows there is no public transport in many rural areas. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is involved in an initiative in this regard in his constituency. The free travel is of no use unless a good public transport system is in place. For many of those living in rural areas, there is not any public transport system. The Department pays a set amount each time to Bus Éireann or whoever under the free travel scheme. I am a great advocate of the semi-State and State sector, but where it does not provide a public transport service and where public private partnerships exist to provide bus services, such as that in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, people should be allowed to utilise the passes for other forms of transport, such as taxis. I appreciate it is difficult to administer, but perhaps the Minister could stipulate a fixed monetary amount over which he would have control and which would be available to people in those areas where there is not a public transport system, to use for taxis, private buses or public private partnership transport schemes. The passes are only useful on buses and trains provided by State companies. We must extend the scope and utility value of the passes. Otherwise, they will remain behind the picture or over the mantelpiece and will not be used. I know people to whom the passes are not of any use. I do not wish to be disparaging. It is something the Minister should examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about inflation and compensation for inflation, inflation proofing as it is called. My colleague, Deputy Broughan, tried to introduce an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill last year to take account of this. The increases in the Bill are not that generous. We sought a £14 increase, but that is always the way. We will always look for something more. Despite the increases, inflation erodes their value. The increase in the price of fuel, <Col N="127" /> for example, eroded the real value of those increases to pensioners. Therefore, the reality was not as good as the announcement. Some account must be taken of inflation and consideration given to inflation proofing.</P>
    <P>There is always a serious poverty problem for elderly citizens and other pensioners. One of the best schemes introduced was the housing aid for the elderly scheme. Even the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General did not criticise it that much. However, it is the one area on which I would criticise the Minister. While I know it may not be his area, he should get together with the Minister for Health and Children and ensure more money is available for the scheme. Elderly people live in abject poverty and poor conditions in a number of houses throughout the country. They do not have toilets or wash-hand basins. That may sound strange and it may be something the Minister may want to tackle in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Children, but it is something which infuriates me and makes me wonder if it is worthwhile. That must be changed. No one, especially an elderly person, must be left without the basic facilities of a toilet and washing facilities. People living in this country are without those at present. They may live down boreens or wherever, but they exist.</P>
    <P>Another area is the carer's allowance and the increase in the respite care grant from £300 to £400 in section 14. That is disappointing by any standards. There was an expectation among carers that this would be doubled to £600. If we ever get back into Government, I will be disappointed if we do not give £1,000 respite care grants. It is very important and perhaps the Minister might consider that on Committee Stage. Carers are disappointed with the Government. There is no recognition of carers and the excellent job they do, keeping people in their homes rather than putting them in institutional care so that those people are happy in their home environment. There is no legislative basis for or constitutional recognition of the work of carers.</P>

      <P>By agreement, the Government has given the remainder of its time to Fine Gael. Deputy Kenny is sharing time with Deputies Ring, Hayes, Farrelly and McGahon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The late John Kelly used to speak in the House and at parliamentary meetings about the dangers of giving young people the facility of driving a ton of metal down a highway at 100 miles an hour. The evidence and analysis of most fatal accidents is sent to the traffic corps at national level and traffic corps personnel con<Col N="129" /> centrate on that. I compliment Deputies Naughten and Coveney for producing their report and scheme in respect of this matter. Time is short and I wish to make a few suggestions.</P>
      <P>The traffic calming measures in place throughout the country do not succeed in their objectives. They are like chicanes in Formula One racing. They comprise signs surrounded by concrete bollards or parapets and are often badly lit. They are not painted clearly enough according to the requirements of the National Road Authority and there should also be reflector strips there. Many drivers do not see these signs and once they get through these narrow passages they find themselves on the straight road again and are inclined to resume speed. The areas between traffic calming bollards should be painted a different colour, such as red, so that drivers know they are in a zone of controlled speed. There will not ever be adequate Garda surveillance for all villages and small towns and unless permanent cameras are installed in these areas people will continue to break the law.</P>
      <P>In the administrative county of Mayo, the third largest in the country, there is a dedicated traffic corps of four gardaí. When the patrols overlap one squad may work from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. while the other operates from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. but it is physically impossible to cover an area that size with a force that limited.</P>
      <P>It is crazy that a 17 year old can receive a provisional licence for two years and then two further years without undergoing a test, instruction or tuition. A person is given a licence that raises the possibility of him or her becoming involved in a serious traffic accident. The measures mentioned by my colleagues are worthy of consideration and until we make it socially unacceptable to engage in such activity we will not have an answer to this problem. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to speak on this matter because for years I have been trying to address this problem and the problem of drinking. All Governments, including my own, refused to address these linked problems. The glorification of drink is tragic and we recently received a report that highlights this. We did not need it to tell us about the number of young children, particularly girls, who are drinking.</P>
      <P>Last month 50 people were delivered to graveyards, which is tragic. The media focused attention on this through its coverage, not Fine Gael, and we must accept that unless deterrents are introduced young people will continue to kill themselves like flies crashing against a wall. They are endangering the road for everyone. Fifty deaths in one month is like the First World War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must come to terms with this. The creation of a highway patrol, similar to those in Germany and France, is absolutely necessary. The patrol must be given draconian powers and should be able to impound cars if necessary. A points system must also be introduced. Why are cars which <Col N="130" /> can reach 150 miles per hour allowed into the country when the speed limit is 60 miles per hour? It is a nonsense but then we are very good at nonsense. We have any amount of legislation which is not enforced. The first thing we must do is fix governors on to cars if we are serious about stemming the flow of young people into graveyards. That should be a priority for any Government &ndash; Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour should act as one on this. Recent graphic advertisements pass over the heads of young people because they feel accidents will not happen to them but to someone else. We must realise that boys and girls of 17 have no sense of responsibility; nobody under 21 should be allowed to drive a car. Our main responsibility is to the thousands who use the roads every day. We read every day of awful tragedies in every county in Ireland and last night two young men died in Emyvale in Monaghan; we must stop this and deterrents are the only way to do so.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member no Government has had the courage to address this problem and the associated problem of drinking. Young people have been cynically and successfully targeted by the breweries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I particularly congratulate Deputy Naughten, who published a position paper on behalf of Fine Gael on this important issue last September. Deputy Naughten has raised this issue in different ways in recent years and I am glad he and other colleagues sponsored this motion.</P>
      <P>I have great respect for the Minister of State but it is an absolute disgrace that two and a half years after the publication of the Government's plan to improve road safety we have yet to see the penalty points legislation. We are a laughing stock among other EU countries, all of which have a penalty points system. We now have the ludicrous system whereby the Six Counties have a penalty points system while the Republic does not. I recently asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the number of successful prosecutions which had been taken against those driving dangerously on the Dublin-Belfast road. Deputy McGahon knows that road well; it is the most dangerous road in Ireland because there are not ever any prosecutions for dangerous driving on it. What happens if a garda takes a prosecution against someone from Northern Ireland driving in the Republic? Where does the case go once that person returns to Northern Ireland? There is not a prosecution so a case is not launched against such people. There is no way of bringing them to book, as one cannot extradite a person for a traffic offence. We must introduce a penalty points system on both sides of the Border which would ensure that Northern Ireland drivers who drive dangerously in this jurisdiction would be given penalty points in Northern Ireland. The reverse would apply to drivers from the Republic driving in the North. The situation is the same in France and Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> We need to do this quickly but the Government has not introduced the necessary legislation two and a half years after it promised to do so. The time scale for road safety has been forgotten and that will have to be addressed. Deputy McGahon is right in saying we need deterrents. I support the principle of taking cars off the road if their drivers continually drive dangerously.</P>
    <P>Last September Deputy Naughten made an innovative proposal regarding car insurance for young people. He proposed that young drivers who sign up to a stringent new hazard perception test and a range of other tests rather than the typical driving instructor test should have a preferential rating when it came to car insurance premia. Many young drivers are bad drivers; wearing baseball caps they drive around housing estates causing all sorts of difficulties because they have no experience. However, there are also many young drivers who want to drive safely and well and those who take that difficult test should be given the low premia enjoyed by other responsible people. Those two issues are crucial and I ask the Government to give consideration to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I had the opportunity last week to refer to the worst accident black spot in the country, namely, Slane Bridge. The accident to which I referred was not caused by car drivers on this occasion, it was caused when a lorry went out of control. On the local radio station this morning there was a report from a woman who saw a lorry approach the traffic lights on Slane Bridge yesterday and overtake a car that had stopped because the traffic lights were red. The lorry crossed the bridge even though the lights were against it but thankfully the gardaí were present and they confiscated the lorry.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there are many accident black spots throughout the country and that accidents are often caused by the way some people drive. However, every young driver should not be penalised for the sins of a few individuals. Modern cars are capable of reaching much higher speeds than those used on our roads when I was young and when I was unfortunate enough to be involved in an accident or two. When driving a car in those days one could not accelerate beyond 35 miles per hour before the steering wheel began to shake. Therefore, one did not accelerate to higher speeds and was more safe as a result, but that is not the case today. The Government should negotiate with the insurance companies and insist that only people, particularly young drivers, who are involved in accidents for which they are at fault and which were caused by speeding, should be penalised. Everyone should not be penalised because of the actions of a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority is responsible for implementing Government policy in respect of national primary roads. Accidents at Slane Bridge have now claimed the lives of 22 people. <Col N="132" /> Traffic lights were erected on the bridge in recent years and David Garvey, Lord have mercy on him, was the most recent person to be killed as a result of having to stop vehicles at the bottom of a steep, one mile long hill. If a lorry happens to go out of control approaching the traffic lights, the people in the cars in front are the ones who will suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister's private consultant addressed a meeting in Slane last night and stated that lorries will, in future, be stopped at the top of the town and made to travel down the hill in convoy. I have no problem with that. However, the Minister has the power to provide the National Roads Authority with the money to construct a new bridge. My colleague, Deputy Bruton, took such action in Navan when the National Roads Authority had no intention of providing a new bridge over the Blackwater in order to alleviate traffic congestion. The bottom line is that the buck stops with the Minister of the day in terms of dealing with accident black spots. The Minister of State should communicate that message to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It is not acceptable to me, as an elected representative for County Meath, that heavy goods vehicles will be stopped at the top of Slane town and that money will not be made available to build a new bridge. People want a new bridge to be built in order that many lives will be saved.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party supports the motion, which was tabled by Fine Gael. I congratulate my colleague from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, on her appointment as Fine Gael spokesperson. I also compliment Deputy Naughten on tabling the motion and the work he has consistently done on this issue over a long period.</P>
      <P>This is a life and death issue. More than 400 people are killed and approximately 10,000 are injured on our roads every year. That is a level of carnage which is worse than that which obtained during the blackest periods during the troubles in Northern Ireland. On a daily basis, families are suffering the unnecessary loss of a loved one as a result of road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to suggest that the direct responsibility for these deaths and losses rests with any Minister. The responsibility for a death or a car crash rests ultimately with drivers and other road users. However, we must reflect on a number of fundamental facts as we debate this issue. First, our record on road safety is the worst in Europe. An article by Michael O'Regan in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 10 January referred to a report given to a committee of the House by Mr. Brian Dalton of the insurance division of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="133" /> ment and stated that Mr. Dalton had indicated that Ireland is currently ranked third worst of the 15 EU member states on road accident frequency and its fatality rate was the highest in Europe. We must consider the reasons for this. It cannot be the case that we have the worst or the most careless drivers in Europe because there is no evidence to suggest that Irish drivers are somehow worse than their European counterparts. We must look at a number of other reasons for our poor record.</P>
    <P>We must give due consideration to the contributing factors such as the condition of our roads, the competence and qualifications of drivers, the adequacy of road safety legislation and the degree to which the rules of the road are enforced. On all of those issues, responsibility rests with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In terms of addressing the avoidable factors which contribute to the deaths and injuries that occur on our roads, the Minister has been a failure. The extent of his failure is underlined in the extraordinary statement made late last year by the chairperson of the National Safety Council, Mr. Eddie Shaw, which was reported by Tim O'Brien in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 20 December 2000. The article in question states:</P>
    <P>Announcing that 408 people had died on the State's roads so far this year &ndash; 11 more than the corresponding period last year &ndash; the chairman, Mr. Eddie Shaw, criticised the Government for not implementing aspects of the five-year strategy The Road to Safety 19982002 . . . Mr. Shaw was unequivocal in his criticism of the Government for &ldquo;launching a strategy with no budget&rdquo;. He pointed out that the penalty points system for drivers was supposed to have been developed during 1998 and legislation to enact it brought in by 1999, but that was not now expected until the end of 2001 or early 2002.</P>
    <P>The article proceeds with a direct quote from Mr. Shaw to the effect that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Road deaths are twice what they should be by international comparison, and if the strategy was on target 50 people who have died so far this year would be alive. Ultimately we could drop the kill rate by 50 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot recall any occasion on which the chairman of a State agency criticised its parent Department, the Minister to whom he is accountable and the Government in such trenchant and unequivocal terms.</P>
    <P>Mr. Shaw was not the first chairman of the National Safety Council to tackle Government policy because, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> report, his predecessor, Mr. Cartan Finegan, warned the Government as early as March 1999 that the strategy was in danger of failure. The article further states that according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, Mr. Finegan had &ldquo;an increasingly fraught relationship with the Department of the Envir<Col N="134" /> onment in 1999 and repeatedly asked for support&rdquo;. It is not the Opposition parties which are pointing the finger at Government for its failure in this area. It is those who were appointed by Government and who are responsible for implementing Government policy who are saying that this is a failure of Government, that Government has not delivered.</P>
    <P>An obvious example of where Government has not delivered is its failure to introduce the penalty points system. Last night the Minister of State informed us that the drafting of the Road Traffic Bill, 2000, was approved by Government on 26 July 2000, two years after it was to have been introduced. The drafting has been approved but, six or seven months on, we have not yet seen a draft. No Bill has yet been published and the Minister of State has informed us that even when it is enacted it will not take effect because a number of other initiatives must be taken to facilitate the introduction and administration of a penalty points system, for example, the commencement of section 24 of the Road Traffic Act and the compilation of a national driver file. Not only have we had almost three years of inaction by the Government on the issue, we also have a prediction of further long-fingering into the future.</P>
    <P>We have had a problem with driver testing in recent years. It is no secret that the number of cars was increasing dramatically. The Department of the Environment and Local Government was the recipient of the car registration tax collected owing to the increased numbers of cars and it did not make provision, until five minutes to midnight, for additional driver testers. The result has been huge delays in driver testing and also, because of the failure rate among those undergoing the driving test, a quarter of drivers are not qualified to drive because they do not have a driving licence. This has happened under this Administration.</P>
    <P>On top of that, the Government is presiding over a traffic and transport policy which concentrates increased volumes of heavy traffic on roads which are not adequate to deal with it, which puts most of the freight and passenger traffic onto our roads. When the roads are not adequately developed, not properly surfaced, with bends and other kinds of problems, lorries rushing to meet a shipping deadline at a port and jostling with cars containing business people rushing to a meeting somewhere, as well as people who are going about their personal business, we have all of the ingredients of the crashes and so-called accidents and tragedies we have witnessed. The Government, in a nutshell, has not dealt with the factors which are contributing to road deaths and accidents on our roads. It has been a miserable failure in this area. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and his two lieutenants, the Ministers of State, Deputies Dan Wallace and Molloy, both of whom have some responsibility in this area, have been an absolute failure in dealing with what needed to be dealt with at a legis<Col N="135" /> lative and policy level to try to reduce the number of deaths on our roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>It is baffling that in a country where the normal speed limit is 60 miles per hour and the speed limit on motorways is 70 miles per hour there are vehicles which can travel at speeds of up to 140 or 150 miles per hour. Without that capacity, the excessive speeds that contribute to accidents could not be reached. It is crazy that cars on our roads can reach speeds up to 80 miles per hour above the speed limit on motorways.</P>
      <P>In preparing for this debate, I cast my mind over the incidents I see on the roads that give rise to accidents and to people taking risks and that could be eliminated. Like most Deputies, I drive much more than the average driver. What I particularly notice is learner drivers driving at peak times at relatively slow speeds, forcing other drivers to drive in convoys. However, if drivers are to learn to drive properly, they must be exposed to peak-time conditions. My secretary informed me recently that as she was going home from work one evening, she found herself travelling behind a large van, in front of which was a learner driver. The driver behind her became frustrated and pulled out, something he should not have done. There was not an accident, but it seems it came close to it. We need to address the problem of road rage and discourtesy in our driving culture. I do not know what can be done about the learner driver situation I described. On certain parts of the national primary route large convoys of heavy goods vehicles can build up and effectively slow down the speed of traffic to around 40 miles per hour. People then become frustrated and pull out from behind these convoys and that can give rise to dangerous situations.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon of road rage is not unique to this country, but it is very much a feature. We have all seen drivers on motorways and dual carriageways who nip in and out of lanes, overtake in the slow lane and so on. This is dangerous and if somebody wants to pull in to let traffic behind pass, a difficult situation can arise. The convoys I describe could be convoys of trucks, cars or a mixture. Farm machinery on roads at specific times can give rise to problems as well. There are times, for instance, when farmers want to avail of good weather to spread slurry, but their vehicles can cause a large back-up in traffic. I am not sure what can be done about that, but I suggest a regulation to discourage farm machinery from using busy roads at peak times. There are aspects of our driving which, because of the inadequacy of our roads, can give rise to convoys developing, to traffic slowing down, to people becoming irritated, to road rage setting in, and to people taking chances they would not normally take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming up to Dublin this week, I was travelling in darkness and encountered fog along parts of the road. I passed two vehicles, each of which had only one headlamp &ndash; this is obviously an enforcement issue. I was not certain, as I looked <Col N="136" /> up the road, that the vehicle approaching me with one light was a four wheeled vehicle. It was a van. These matters are hugely important. There must be more stringent enforcement of the rules regarding car lights. If there is one car on the road with only one functioning headlamp, it is one too many.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises with regard to heavy goods vehicles, which appear to be involved in a large number of accidents. There are speed limits and other regulations in place for these vehicles but we regularly see them travelling too fast on our roads and motorways. Something effective and urgent must be done to address that problem.</P>
    <P>I encountered another road safety problem during the local election campaign in 1999. I was canvassing on a large housing estate in Waterford. A green area, provided by the local authority, was located across from where I was canvassing and a small saloon car, with no registration plates and occupied by two young men, was being driven on it. Although it was a beautiful evening, there were fortunately no children or senior citizens walking across the area. I rang the Garda and was informed that the young men were not in violation of the road traffic Acts as they were not on the public road. These cars, I understand, can be bought for £10 or £20 from a garage and young men can drive them around before setting fire to them and abandoning them. It is another danger on the roads that unregistered and uninsured vehicles such as this can be driven on public areas, not to mind on public roads.</P>
    <P>We must apply ourselves to tackling these situations and I hope the Minister will take my comments into consideration. My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, spoke of the lethargy on the part of the Department and the Minister in establishing a proper penalty points system. Introducing a penalty points system under which people can lose their licences is the only effective way of getting the message across. People will realise that the current situation cannot continue.</P>
    <P>A not altogether unrelated point is that we should seek to eradicate the practice of allowing learner drivers to drive unaccompanied. Obviously, it will be necessary to deal with the driving test delays. The Government must also address the driving culture in this country and the anger we constantly see on our roads. In my experience, drivers are more courteous in Britain and are more concerned about other drivers on the road.</P>
    <P>I drove home from the House a fortnight ago and on the road between Waterford and Tramore, where I live, there had been a fatal accident. A young man on a motor scooter had been killed. I do not know the exact circumstances aside from the rumours one hears. However, seeing a diversion on the road and ambulances and gardaí at the scene brings home the reality of fatal accidents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> We must work on a number of aspects of road safety and much can be done through regulation and enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. The ongoing tragedy of the carnage on our roads, not just every weekend but practically every day, must be taken seriously and addressed. When one reads that there is a death on our roads every 19 hours, it concentrates one's mind on the gaps that exist in road manners, road safety and the legislation that applies to road safety.</P>
      <P>There are so many gaps to be filled it is difficult to know where to begin and to identify the primary problems. However, it is absolutely ludicrous that a young person can buy a car with just a birth certificate to prove their age and enough money to pay for the licence and insurance. Legally, they are entitled to sit into the car by themselves and drive it at a speed of up to 70 miles per hour without any other control or training being required. That is ridiculous. There is no other occupation or profession in which no training, accreditation and approval of some description are required in advance of undertaking the occupation. Safe road use is not underpinned when such a system is legally acceptable. It allows the conditions I have described to prevail.</P>
      <P>The culture of good use of the roads and safe driving must begin at school level, particularly at primary and second levels, where it would be possible to inculcate the ideas of safe driving and the rules of the road. There is also an opportunity to introduce driving lessons at second level. The transition year, for example, could usefully be used, where pupils are over the required legal age, to introduce them to the good culture of safe driving. They might also begin to appreciate some of the hazards and risks involved if driving were introduced in that fashion rather than in a more negative fashion later when there are, in effect, challenges before them to break speed limits and so forth.</P>
      <P>We have failed to apply the law. Monetary fines appear to have little or no impact on drivers who are in breach of the law. The only way to deal with this is to introduce a penalty points system. I have called for its introduction on a number of occasions. The penalty points will be shown to be an effective means of keeping track of people's road traffic offences. Sloppy and reckless driving leads to most of the accidents and road deaths. However, the State does not appear to have any way of keeping track of an individual's road offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A truly dangerous driver could escape for a long time with cautions and fines until they finally kill somebody. This is the type of driver the penalty points system will remove from our roads. I tried to use a series of parliamentary questions last year to assess whether lives could have been saved. On 5 December, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed me that five people were convicted of the charge of dangerous <Col N="138" /> driving causing death during 1998 and 1999. On 12 December I asked if the Minister could provide the Dáil with the summonses served and the convictions made against these five people. The Minister was unable or unwilling to provide this information even though the question only referred to five specific cases. It is legitimate to ask if the five individuals convicted in those two years would have been off the roads if penalty points were in place.</P>
    <P>The current shambolic system means past road traffic offences are hidden, yet these regular offences can point to low standards of driving. Penalty points would force drivers to get into the habit of good driving. They are easy for the Garda to enforce and the driver knows how many chances he or she has left before they will be put off the road. The bureaucratic nightmare that is now in place discourages the Garda from enforcing the law. The Government's road safety plan has been in place since 1998 but the figures for road deaths indicate it is a failure. That is because the most important element of the plan, the penalty points, is still a long way from being in place.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, promised that the Bill would be enacted by the end of this year. He could not give any commitments on the availability of a national driver file by the end of the year yet penalty points to keep track of offences can operate without such a file.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an IT hub so the Department should have no problems accessing the skills to implement the necessary IT infrastructure. A penalty points system is in operation in Northern Ireland and I would like to know what contacts the Minister has had with his counterpart in the North to assist in the implementation of a similar system.</P>
    <P>I also wish to address the training provided for driving instructors. What standards are necessary to set up a driving school? Can anyone decide to set up such a school? Who evaluates driving instructors? What qualifications are they required to have? Are the qualifications accredited or evaluated? It appears that one does not have to have accreditation or evaluation and that anyone can become a driving instructor. No other profession operates with such a lack of standards and accreditation. No teacher or course instructor in any other area would be able to deliver a course without being accredited.</P>
    <P>The epidemic of mobile telephones has hit the country. This does not just involve people using telephones in the office or the restaurant. Unfortunately people are also using mobile telephones when driving. Motorists who drive with one hand and use the other hand to hold a telephone are surely not observing best practice. Will the Minister outline how many prosecutions and convictions there have been due to dangerous or careless driving because the driver was using a mobile telephone? This road hazard is on the increase rather than on the decrease. People are taking <Col N="139" /> little notice of recommendations or advice on the use of mobile telephones when driving.</P>
    <P>Learner drivers should always be accompanied by a qualified driver. However, it is ridiculous that a learner driver can drive unaccompanied and without training. There is no enforcement of any requirement to be accompanied by a qualified driver even when the learner is on a second or third provisional licence.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to speed limits. It is ridiculous that the maximum speed limit is 70 mph yet cars are designed to travel at 130 mph or 140 mph. What is the logic in providing someone with a vehicle which can travel at speeds which are illegal? This issue must be addressed in terms of managing driving speed.</P>
    <P>Some of the recent safe driving advertisements have been informative and startling and I hope they are effective. However, there is a need for a pro-active campaign on safe driving. There should also be a dedicated Garda traffic corps which will not just hand out parking fines but will monitor safe road use and good driving practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak in this debate and to support the motion, as amended. I am delighted this subject is being debated but it would have been preferable if we could have agreed the wording of a motion. We need to get the message across that road safety is an important topic which is of serious concern to all Members.</P>
      <P>Some Opposition Deputies acknowledged, perhaps not implicitly, that this Government has prioritised and driven the road safety agenda efficiently, actively and effectively. The road safety strategy is already producing good results in terms of outcomes and delivery of promised policies and measures.</P>
      <P>Higher public, media and political priority is now being given to road safety and this debate is testament to that fact. The media is also giving regular coverage to road safety. The Government has led and welcomes this process. By setting quantified and clearly stated objectives for road safety in its strategy, the Government has deliberately held itself more accountable than any previous Government for progressing the road safety agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline some of the achievements. It is unhelpful that Fine Gael speakers have tried to talk down the progress being made with the strategy. This may be a good idea from a political point of view but it is not very productive from a road safety point of view. The annual toll of road deaths was reduced by more than 12% in 1999 and 2000 since the introduction of the strategy. In <Col N="140" /> 1999, serious injuries from road accidents were reduced by nearly 15% relative to 1997 which was the base year for the strategy. Compared with a continuation of the rising trends obtaining up to 1997, it can be estimated that more than 100 lives were saved in 2000 due to the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>We can take some pride from these statistics. However, I agree with Opposition Deputies that no one can be complacent about the tragic and avoidable toll of human life and health which road accidents take. There is not an acceptable level of road accidents. It is right that there should be political support for progressively ambitious road safety targets. It is also right that impatience should be felt at any setbacks or delays in the existing strategy.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, however, for criticism of Irish road safety performance to be based on exaggeration or false claims some of which have, unfortunately, been put forward in this debate. Ireland does not have the worst, or a low ranking, road safety performance in terms of EU comparisons. By the most reliable indicator of road safety &ndash; the number of road deaths per head of population &ndash; Ireland stood at 12.4 per 100,000 in 1998 which was the seventh highest among EU member states. In the past two years Ireland's rate of deaths per 100,000 population has reduced further and is now 11.2.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong to claim that the strategy has failed to meet quantified outcome targets. The two interim targets set for achievement by 2000 have already been met and exceeded. These were to bring the rate of Irish road deaths within the prevailing EU average of 116 per 100,000 population and to implement accident reductions at 240 locations on the national road network.</P>
    <P>There has also been exaggeration by a factor of eight of the probability of the involvement of young people in fatal accidents. I say this not to minimise the real and continuing risks to young people from road accidents but to avoid compounding distress or sacrificing credibility by insisting on wrong assertions.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of the Government's strategy, the road safety agencies have been taking practical actions to make our roads safer. For example, the NRA's roads programme is reducing the number of fatal road accidents by an average increment of 14 each year and the number of serious injury accidents by 40. The gardaí served 224,000 fines on the spot for speeding and 84,000 fines for non-seat belt wearing last year. This form of interaction between the gardaí and road users did not exist before 1997 and has been intensifying since then. The National Safety Council has valuably joined forces in a succession of safety campaigns with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to achieve greater economies of scale and coverage in relation to road safety awareness throughout the island.</P>
    <P>Concern is being expressed and criticism is being levelled at the delay in implementing a pen<Col N="141" /> alty points system. It must be understood that the strategy comprises a wide array of policies and measures. They have different timescales and requirements in terms of deliverability. No one measure constitutes the key to the strategy. It is widely accepted that road safety strategies must consist of many different policies and measures and that all have their contribution to make.</P>
    <P>A penalty points system will be an important and worthwhile measure in support of the strategy and it is being pursued urgently. However, it will not of itself guarantee the success of the strategy, as some have wrongly assumed. It has been publicly stated since mid-1999 that the IT systems needed to support a national driver file, with penalty points functionality, would take until 2001 to put in place. My Department is working urgently to ensure delivery of this target. I intend that the legislation in support of penalty points will be published shortly and that it will be processed by the Oireachtas ahead of this deadline. Everything is being done by the Government and the Department to try to ensure it will be in place in time.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, was not in a position to finish his speech and to respond to points made about driving tests. It was not until 1998 that the trend towards greatly increased driver tests demand became fully established and that the link between this demand and the buoyant Irish economy asserted itself inescapably. In 1998 there was an increase of 23% over 1997 resulting in an all time record of 146,506 test applications. This trend continued in 1999 with 153,389 applications. That is an increase of 5% on 1998 and 45% on 1995. Once again that record was broken in 2000 with 167,000 applications received. That represents an 8% increase on the record intake in 1999 and 55% on 1995. Indications so far this year are that we are likely to receive approximately the same volume of applications during the current year.</P>
    <P>Despite this unprecedented rise in demand, the waiting times for driving tests have improved considerably with the average waiting time falling from 33 to 20 weeks, while the longest anyone has to wait for a test has fallen from an average of 41 to 22 weeks. The current backlog of driving test applications is 72,000. This is down from the high of 102,000 in 1999 and a reduction of 16,500 on the starting figure for 2000. This improvement in the level of service has resulted from a number of measures taken by my Department.</P>
    <P>Improvements to the service in 1999 and 2000 were achieved by increasing the numbers and productivity of driver testers. Significant additional resources have been allocated to the service, which now numbers 115 testers compared to 66 in 1998. The recruitment of additional testers, both permanent and contract, followed the holding of a competition by the Civil Service Commission and lengthy negotiations with the driver testers union to agree greater productivity and the recruitment of contract testers. Additional staff and productivity, together with Saturday working, has increased the testing <Col N="142" /> capacity of the service to over 200,000 standard tests annually. Access to the service has also been improved through the provision of three new test centres in Tallaght, Raheny and a second centre in Limerick. In response to the upsurge in demand in 2000, the Department took steps to employ retired testers and recruited 12 additional testers. We also negotiated a bonus scheme with existing testers with a view to maximising their productivity. We also propose to recruit additional contract testers this year. I am confident these measures should enable us to meet our customer service target of ten weeks' maximum waiting time for an appointment by mid-year.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that where an individual requires a test for urgent reasons they will be facilitated as far as possible. During the most recent period for which figures are available, 44% of applicants were tested within 15 weeks. I am conscious of the need to provide a testing service which can offer tests within a reasonable period of time and I assure the House that both I and my Department will take the measures necessary to ensure that a quality service is provided. It is also important to note that a number of people on the waiting list for driving tests have indicated they do not want a driving test for some time.</P>
    <P>As regards driver testing and road safety, the parameters for the driving test now reflect the high standards laid down in EU directives which facilitates the recognition of Irish driving licences in the EU and internationally. The driving tester must determine whether an applicant is competent to drive a vehicle safely and with due regard for the safety and convenience of other persons. The role of driver testing in ensuring that drivers reach an acceptable level of competence is important in the context of road safety. I assure the House that the content of the test will be kept under constant review and where opportunities to improve the test become available they will be taken.</P>
    <P>The question of training for driver testers was raised by the previous speaker. I acknowledge that due to the unprecedented demand placed on the service in recent years and the need to train an additional 49 testers, the opportunity to put in place a comprehensive training programme for driver testers has been limited. However, I am pleased to inform the House that a comprehensive training programme for testers will take place this year. It will incorporate refresher training to ensure a consistent application of test standards as well as customer care skills.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy proposes improvements in driver training and testing as well as in educational programmes as complements to its primary counter-measures in relation to speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing. Proposals for improving the quality control and regulation of driving instruction have been announced. These include the recognition of certain private approved bodies which would operate to quality standards and train, assess and register driving instructors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> An initiative by the Irish Motorcycle Action Group to establish a network of motorcycle instructors has also been supported by my Department. Funding has been advanced to the Irish Rider Training Association which has been established under the auspices of MAG to enable it to carry out this task. There is a commitment to address the issue of initial practical training for motor cyclists.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to address some of the other issues raised. It is important to note that the Government has been the first to prepare and adopt a road safety strategy. Within its framework and co-ordination, the road safety agencies will continue to strive for a reduced toll of fatalities and serious injuries. A 20% reduction in deaths and serious injuries by the end of 2002, relative to 1997, is the minimum we must target. We can and will succeed in delivering this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Government's strategy to improve road safety. The Government's strategy for road safety for 1998 to 2000 was the first national road safety strategy to be formulated by any Government. While I welcome the progress being made towards improving road safety, more must be done if we are to substantially reduce the level of fatalities on our roads. I fully support the statement made before Christmas by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, in which he said, &ldquo;There is no acceptable rate of road fatalities or injuries in this country&rdquo;. He is correct in his analysis of the matter. He further stated, &ldquo;All road accidents must be regarded as preventable, and the avoidable loss of life is tragic&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Speed is a central reason there are so many fatalities on our roads. By the end of 1999 Ireland's road fatality rate per one million inhabitants stood at 112. Road deaths increased by 59, or nearly 13%, between 1997 and 1999. In the same period serious injuries decreased by over 15%, but there is no acceptable rate of road fatalities or injuries. The Government has implemented a range of new measures to support road safety improvements, including a greater Garda enforcement of the road traffic laws in the areas of speeding, drinking and seat belt usage. Fixed automated speed cameras and breath testing have been introduced. These measures are being further extended in support of greater road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research into the involvement of young people in road accidents and the problem of drugs and drinking is being advanced. Education and information on road safety is being improved, including the joint promotion of campaigns with the Northern Ireland authorities. The road safety strategy depends on the active and co-ordinated implementation of all its policies and measures. The implementation of any single measure is not sufficient alone to ensure the success of our road <Col N="144" /> safety strategy. An effective road safety strategy must maintain public confidence at all times. A rigorous enforcement of our traffic laws is important in the ongoing battle to reduce the number of casualties on our roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments made by the Irish Insurance Federation in its pre-budget submission last year when it said that the motor insurance industry actively supports the national road safety strategy. In 2000, members of the Irish Insurance Federation contributed £900,000 to the National Safety Council's road safety promotional activities. I agree with the policy position that the enactment of educational and engineering measures in the national road safety strategy is a vital component of a comprehensive approach to road safety promotion.</P>
    <P>The current high level of accidents and casualties on our roads is a contributory factor to insurance costs. It is important that financial resources are available at all times for the implementation of the national road safety strategy. I am confident that the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government fully agree with the need to allocate substantial financial resources to upgrade the level of Garda activity in enforcing the road traffic laws and to enable the National Safety Council to scale up its road safety educational and advertising activities.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by all agencies and interested groupings in the high level group on road safety that benefits can accrue to the State from the allocation of increased resources in order to implement the national road safety strategy. Putting aside increased resources for that strategy must be seen by all as an investment that will pay rich dividends, rather than as an expenditure with no tangible returns. The tangible return that can be delivered by the successful implementation of the national road safety strategy is the reduction of fatalities and other causalities on our roads.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a family on this island that has not been touched in some shape or form by a road accident. Some families have suffered more than others, particularly where loved ones have died. There is no acceptable rate of road fatalities or injuries. It is incumbent on all of us to implement the key provisions of the national road safety strategy at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, the Government established the motor insurance advisory board. One of its recommendations is that the proceeds of the 2% levy on motor insurance business under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1982, should be applied to road safety projects within the framework of the national road safety strategy. The Government should give serious consideration to this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Young drivers have to pay high levels of motor insurance and, therefore, I welcome the fact that the Government has established the motor insurance advisory board to ascertain how car insurance can best be reduced for such drivers. The plain fact is that young drivers pay exorbitant <Col N="145" /> levels of car insurance, with some in their early twenties paying as much as £3,000 or £3,500 for annual car cover. This is not an incentive for young people to start up a small business because car insurance would be such a prohibitive cost in the initial stages of such an enterprise. If young drivers can drive without any accidents for a short period, their insurance costs should be substantially reduced. Insurance companies have to come clean in proving that young drivers are not being discriminated against. There are varying levels of insurance premia for young drivers across different insurance sectors. Speed is a reason young drivers are involved in accidents, but the vast majority are paying exorbitant levels of car insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Opposition Deputies for the temper of their contributions in recognising that this is a serious issue and not one to be kicked around like a political football. We can all foresee that a penalty points system will be introduced. That is a welcome development. We must address a number of elemental questions in this debate. Why is it so dangerous to travel on our roads? Why is motor insurance so expensive for younger people in particular, although not just for them? Why do we compare so badly with other countries when it comes to accident records? Even the contrast between here and the six north-eastern counties is striking. Why are we so different from other countries? Why are our roads so dangerous? Why is insurance so expensive? There are a number of reasons, none of which has to do with Government.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest &ndash; it is not just in relation to driving, but a whole plethora of areas in our national life, including the conduct of politics &ndash; something in the Irish culture has not been compliant for many years. Now that we are prosperous we have an opportunity to makes ourselves fully compliant in our respect for the law, including safety in the workplace and on the roads. Unfortunately, that culture of compliance has not been well established for long, but we are moving from a culture of non-compliance to one of compliance. More than anyone else, the Minister is leading the way in that respect, both in terms of his local government reforms and in terms of the way we penalise and punish those who transgress road traffic legislation.</P>
      <P>Why are we so dangerous on the roads? Is it because, in some ways, we have been so successful? Every year there are many thousands of new car registrations which are adding pressure to a stretched road infrastructure. Nobody could have predicted that spectacular success or the number of people who are able, and eligible, to buy new cars. That is a huge change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the problem would be greatly reduced if we could get people off the roads. It would also mean less capital outlay. In addition to focusing on the safety record, a points system and the drink driving issue &ndash; all of which are important &ndash; we should concentrate on the other areas for <Col N="146" /> which the Minister is responsible and which are not often discussed in debates such as this. These include the development of the rail infrastructure and alternatives to road transport. When one considers insurance claims figures, the level of claims by those aged between 18 and 34 is striking. The number of serious accidents those young people cause, whether through exuberance or inexperience, or a mixture of both, is striking.</P>
    <P>There is also a much deeper issue, a compensation mentality, &ldquo;compo hunting&rdquo;, as it is called, that has nothing to do with young people, which reflects on all of us, individually and collectively. That compensation culture is very strong and prevalent here. It is encouraged by the court system.</P>
    <P>A relative of mine who lived in Paris was knocked down by a passing car mounting the pavement. Typically reflecting our culture, he half expected he would get a sizeable claim for his injuries which were not very deep but he was unconscious for a period. When he appeared before the French magistrates court, he was shocked to be informed there were set fees for injuries, that if one suffered a mild concussion, it was worth X number of francs. That is the way the system here should operate. Unfortunately, we have juries, judges and a legal system that tends to be well disposed towards the humble claimant of compensation and this attitude arises from our culture and our history. I am sure Deputy Shatter, who is a very experienced lawyer, would agree. Our juries, legal system and judicial personages are far too generous in the awards they make. They do not take the broader national interest into consideration. This gives rise to the question of freezing awards to dampen the level of compensation claims and to implementing set fees. That issue is important in regard to this motion.</P>
    <P>In terms of making our roads safer, the introduction of a points system is desirable. Any measure that relates to driver training is important.</P>
    <P>To address the problem of joyriding, more positive interventions are required at a local level. With regard to the abuse of horses, the Fettercairn horse project in my constituency has been very successful. It illustrates the benefit of diverting the attention of the youth into other areas of activity. We should invest in go-karting initiatives for the youth in disadvantaged areas. Many youngsters steal cars because there is little else to divert their attention in the underprivileged areas from which they come. If they have an opportunity to drive, through the initiatives I mentioned, the position might be much better.</P>
    <P>I have full confidence in the Minister's ability to tackle these problems. He is one of those Ministers who listens to the backbenchers, absorbs what they have to say and takes it on board. He is one of the Ministers most open in that regard in the Government.</P>

      <P>When I saw this motion, I thought I would not like to be on the Government side and I wondered what its members might say. During a Private Members' motion, generally the Opposition berate the Government for what it has not done, what it promised to do and what it failed to do. There might be some plusses, the Government might say it did this and that. Unfortunately, I did not hear the contributions of the Government speakers other than Deputy Lenihan's and a little of the Minister's.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan spoke on the Social Welfare Bill earlier and Deputy Flanagan referring to his contribution said Deputy Lenihan always adds a little light relief. I was interested to hear what he had to say on this motion. It was notable that he did not greatly praise the Government. Talking of lateral thinking, we were go-karting out somewhere in Bohernabreena at some stage. The issue of safety on our roads is the Achilles' heel of the Government. It is certainly the Achilles' heel of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In 1998 the Government published a five year road safety strategy that referred to reducing the 1997 level of deaths on our roads by 20% by 2002. Sweden has a zero acceptance level of road deaths. Why have we decided that a certain level of road casualties is acceptable? This was the Government that made famous the call for zero tolerance in the justice area. Why can we not do likewise in terms of safety on our roads?</P>
      <P>The Minister briefly mentioned that the Government has brought publicity to the issue. It has, in that we see photographs of, if not the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, wearing a helmet on the back of a motorbike, the Minister astride one. Regrettably that is all they have done. However, the issue has got further publicity because of the horrific carnage on our roads in recent times.</P>
      <P>There are several matters wrong. Our driver training is outdated, the driving test has not been radically changed since it was introduced first in the early 1960s. We do not have a system of statutory registration for driving instructors. For the driving test, we have a waiting list as long as my arm. There are in the region of 300,000 provisional licence holders on the roads. If my memory serves me correctly, that figure is incompatible with the number of people who are awaiting driving tests. How can there be so many provisional licence holders on the road and so few people, albeit on a long waiting list, waiting to be tested? Why are we allowing people to obtain up to eight provisional licences and not doing anything about it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few measures could be introduced without imposing any great hardship. Many motorists drive vehicles with only one headlight or no rear lights and on many occasions gardaí do not pros<Col N="148" /> ecute them. It is considered too minor an offence or the garda knows the motorist in question. The Garda have a small book with various fees they can charge or penalties they can impose and we should consider extending that system. It would be preferable if a garda were to give a motorist a ticket for a £50 charge for failure to have a light working on his or her motor vehicle than to prosecute the motorist, as such offences clog up the court, waste Garda time and are ineffective in many respects.</P>
    <P>With regard to contractors and the condition of our roads, there is a good deal of development taking place around the country and no one seems to be policing contractors. The road between Blessington and Dublin is like a quarry lane. It is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>Many commentators have spoken about the introduction of a penalty points system. Deputy Lenihan spoke about our lack of compliance and our culture of not complying. Statistics reveal that 50% of motorists break the speed limit and I am probably one of those, as are probably half, if not more, of the Members of this House. The introduction of a penalty points system is needed. It is the only deterrent that would address that offence. In this case, the imposition of a fine will not work. However, if I were given three penalty points for taking a right turn when I should not take it between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m., I would not take that turn, but I would continue to take that turn until such time as I were given three penalty points on my licence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of politicians, many local authorities are trying to get approval for road improvements and politicians are afraid to make the difficult decisions and back them.</P>
    <P>With regard to road safety at schools, there are children and vehicles in the area of schools and the Department, in conjunction with the local authorities, should examine road safety in the vicinity of schools.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the failure of the Government to address the serious issue of road safety.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate and congratulate Deputies Naughten and Mitchell on introducing the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will dwell specifically on the number of road accidents in rural areas, which is directly related to the condition of the roads in rural areas. Not enough is being done to ensure the condition of roads in rural areas is improved. We have had a severe winter and there are reports of a growing number of accidents on county roads due to the deterioration in their condition. There should be a plan over a period, be it two, four or ten years, to ensure that we bring the condition of county roads up to an acceptable level, that of the condition of roads in urban areas. There is no reason we could not asphalt rural roads over a reasonable period. Regional roads are currently being asphalted and that is welcome, as it has greatly improved their condition. We should extend that programme of work to include initially country <Col N="149" /> roads on which traffic has greatly increased and then to those roads on which there is less traffic. The improvement of the condition of those roads would substantially reduce the number of accidents and it would also substantially reduce the level of mechanical problems with vehicles.</P>
    <P>The OE test has shown a higher level of mechanical failure in rural areas than in urban areas which is directly related to the condition of the roads. It would improve car performance levels and reduce accident levels if county roads were improved. Too often we see heavy goods vehicles and cars avoiding potholes and bad patches of road by dangerously crossing the lane. Sometimes one even sees it happening on a bend. A comprehensive programme to improve rural roads would have a positive effect on accident levels. The Government has not recognised the growing car ownership, the increase in the number of young drivers on our roads and the higher number of commercial vehicles.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the 4,000 people affected by the 400 deaths on our county roads last year. I support my colleagues who have urged the Government to introduce a penalty points system as an important way of ensuring people become aware at an early stage that they run the risk of losing their licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues, including Deputy Mitchell, have highlighted the fact that there is a death on our roads, on average, every 19 hours. A total of 415 lives were lost last year. Many thousands more suffered serious injury. So far this year, 54 people have died. The Government stands indicted of a scandalous failure to implement its own road safety strategy. In 1998, amid great fanfare and publicity, the Government launched a strategy with a fairly modest objective: by 2002 the number of deaths on our roads would be reduced by 20%. It has become clear that there is no realistic possibility of that objective being achieved. Tragically, it is more likely that the number of road deaths will have increased by 20% between 1998 and 2002.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons we have major accidents on our roads, so many deaths and the lives of so many young people are lost. A total of 25% of car drivers only have a provisional driving licence. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, despite being in office for three and a half years, has found it impossible to organise a driving test system which ensures young people can take a driving test within eight to ten weeks of application. In Dublin, one can wait for nine to 12 months to take the test. As a consequence, the law which prescribes that a person with a provisional licence should be accompanied by a qualified driver is flouted and unenforceable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an unreliable railway service which fails to provide a proper transport system to allow people to travel from one part of the State to another. This is part of the reason we have so many road deaths. People know that the railway <Col N="150" /> service cannot be relied upon. In our cities, particularly Dublin, the Government has failed to implement a coherent and comprehensive public transport strategy. This means that there are more cars on our roads than should be the case. In my constituency, the southern cross motorway should have been completed two years ago. Luas should be operational by now. Instead, the Government has been paralysed by an inability to make decisions. When decisions are finally made, they take years to bear fruit because the Government is caught in such a bureaucratic quagmire.</P>
    <P>Three and a half years ago the Government's road safety strategy promised that a penalty points system would be introduced to penalise motorists who did not comply with the rules of the road. Legislation to implement such a system has yet to be introduced in the House. We were promised that speeding would be dealt with by installing six speed cameras between 2000 and 2002. There are only two cameras to identify cars speeding in a way that could cause major accidents.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle this problem, we need to put out of office a Government which has shown it lacks the capacity to do so. It is a Government which needs to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on our roads, to put in place a comprehensive and reliable public transport system, and to complete major and necessary road works, the absence of which contributes to the regular occurrence of fatal accidents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I spoke last night the number of deaths in the first seven weeks of this new year has risen to 57. It is that inexorable upward trend which motivated this motion and makes it vital that the Government refreshes its commitment to its road safety strategy. Nobody in the House expects the Government to wipe out deaths on our roads. We do not live in a risk-free environment. There will always be the potential for a set of circumstances which leads to an accident. It is the accidents which are preventable for which the Government must take responsibility and do everything possible to prevent.</P>
      <P>Speaker after speaker last night spoke of the shambles that is our driver testing system and the non-existence of legally required training or education, either at the early stages of learning to drive or later as new conditions emerge. There is no training or ongoing campaign to make the public aware of how to handle roundabouts, motorways or cycle paths, in which the Minister's Department has invested heavily. Although cycle paths are supposed to be a life saving measure, this will not happen as neither cyclists, motorists nor pedestrians know how to operate them. There should be a campaign to inform the public how to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that everybody knows the rules of the road and that we all operate to the same <Col N="151" /> rules in order that assumptions can be made about how others will behave. The lack of information available about the rules means that no such assumptions can be made. Last night, the Minister spoke proudly about the increase in the number of on-the-spot fines. He said that it had doubled since 1998. Although this implies more Garda activity, it could equally be interpreted as an increase in speeding. It is a meaningless figure to give.</P>
    <P>A main target of the strategy is to reduce speeding, but this can only be done by changing people's behaviour, which was what the penalty points system was supposed to do. I do not accept the Minister's attempts to talk this down, as it is <Col N="152" /> fundamental to the strategy. Human behaviour is seen as the main contributory factor in accidents. Changing it, therefore, is vital. This can only be done by enforcement. My colleagues have referred to the farce of having only two cameras. The reason there are only two cameras is more farcical. The reason is they are too efficient and detect too many people speeding. Their capacity to detect is greater than that of the Garda to prosecute. I regret the self-congratulatory nature of the Government's amendment to our motion which is inappropriate on such a topic. It will ring hollow to the families who have lost loved ones. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Carers deeply resent the means test which excludes thousands of people from the carer's allowance. The Labour Party supports a fundamental reform of the carer's allowance. It should be a continual care payment that is paid not on the basis of the financial means of relatives, but the needs of those who are receiving care.</P>
      <P>It is time we got rid of the means test which I find abhorrent. I urge the Minister to examine that in the context of the next budget. Every one of us has been cared for, or will be carers, at some time in our lives and we know it is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week job. Carers do tremendous work.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the income disregard for carers has increased to £150 for a single income and £250 for a joint income, creating 5,000 additional carers, nevertheless too many people are still excluded. Some 20,000 carers out of an estimated 100,000 is still not adequate, although the Minister says there are only 50,000 according to the Department's figures. It is time qualitative data were available and that a proper analysis of the number of carers was carried out.</P>
      <P>A Western Area Health Board survey showed there were approximately 20,000 carers in that area alone and there was an almost hysterical reaction from the Government. If that is the number of carers in the west, by extrapolation, there are five times as many throughout the country giving us a figure of at least 100,000. Despite what the Department says, my knowledge, though empirical and anecdotal, suggests we are totally underestimating the number of carers. They do a great job and it is time we recognised that and put it on a legislative basis. I would prefer to see such recognition on a constitutional basis or as a social contract with those people.</P>
      <P>Fuel poverty is a constant harsh reality for tens of thousands of people. I welcome the three week extension of the heating season, though I heard one of the Minister's colleagues saying two weeks. I admit that we failed to do anything about it when in Government but with fuel price increases almost yearly, the £5 rate which has remained unchanged for over a decade is too low. It will cost about £37 million to double the fuel allowance but perhaps the Minister could see his way to do this as so many people depend on it. Because of the rate of inflation, it is not as valuable as it was a couple of years ago. I urge the Minister to examine that. I welcome the extension to 29 weeks, though an extension to 32 weeks would be better. Doubling the rate of allowance would be important for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has received a certain amount of praise for this Bill and, while I praise elements of it, the thrust of it and of the budget generally has managed to increase inequality and relative poverty instead of improving the position. This is one of the worst countries in the EU in terms of the inequalities in society. I had hoped that, in this time of plenty, of budget surplus never before experienced and of huge increases in tax intake, we would be able to address this relative social inequality in the budget.</P>
      <P>People on basic social welfare incomes, such as widow's pension and disability allowance, got an increase of £8 &ndash; from £77.50 per week to the princely sum of £85.50. I challenge anyone in this House to try to live on that. Those people have benefited by only £416 per annum in the budget, whereas a person earning £15,000 a year has benefited by £576 per annum and a person earning £100,000 a year has benefited by £2,532 per annum. Those figures clearly illustrate that, while there are improvements for some people, the main improvements in the budget generally, and subsequently in the Bill, are for people on higher incomes.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything for which the Minister should be congratulated in that regard. Expecting people to live on such basic rates is not on. We should examine seriously the basic rates on which people still live in a country where there is so much wealth and these people must deal with inflation just as the person on £100,000 must do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been shown that a large percentage of people with disabilities, in particular, live in poverty. I had hoped that the area of disability allow<Col N="155" /> ance would be addressed, not just in the £8 per week increase but that the issue of the cost of disability would be addressed in the budget. I ask that the Minister address it in his future considerations. The Disability Federation of Ireland made a good case for a costing of disability payments and I acknowledge that it would not be an easy scheme to administer. Nevertheless, this must be addressed if we are serious about giving people with disabilities real opportunities to have the same living standards as others. A certain percentage of people with disabilities can go out and get a job and in some cases they are supported. There are, however, others who have to live on these basic incomes. They should be given the dignity of having a decent basic income.</P>
    <P>I cannot find mention in either the Social Welfare Bill or in the Finance Bill &ndash; though it was announced by the Minister for Finance and I have a reply to a parliamentary question where he says he will not change his mind &ndash; of his intention to abolish the right to mobility allowance for those who benefit from the disabled drivers and passengers tax relief as and from 1 April 2001. This is a mean little proposal. I do not know whether it comes under any social welfare heading but I cannot find it in the Finance Bill either. I ask that the Government reconsider this as they are taking the mobility allowance from people who clearly have mobility problems. It is a relatively small sum of money and I am sure the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, who is present in the House, would be sympathetic to the point I make. I ask that that issue be reconsidered. It is one that has not received much attention but it is a particularly mean change that should be addressed. I am not sure I am addressing the right Minister but I wanted to raise this issue.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Penrose's comments in relation to carers. Quite a sizeable percentage of carers do not qualify for carer's allowance because of the means test. I acknowledge that there have been improvements in this Bill but we need again to examine the entire system rather than merely making small improvements. We need to consider a carer's payment which would not be means tested but would acknowledge that people who care on a full-time basis are doing a job and saving the State a great deal of money. They should be rewarded. This allowance should not be means tested.</P>
    <P>Many people lose out because of the means test while others lose out because they are in receipt of another social welfare payment and would lose money were they to be in receipt of the carer's allowance. Another aspect to which I draw the Minister's attention is that if one is not in receipt of carer's allowance or another allowance of which a small number of people are in receipt &ndash; the name of which I cannot remember &ndash; one does not qualify for respite grant. That should also be examined as full-time carers who would qualify if they chose to go on carer's allowance <Col N="156" /> do not get the respite grant. That has been increased in this Bill. I ask that we also examine that unfair situation.</P>
    <P>I know a woman who cares full-time for her daughter who is in a wheelchair but she cannot get a respite grant as she chooses to stay on her contributory pension which is worth a few more pounds a week to her. People like that should be included in the respite grant.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the living alone allowance to recipients of disability allowance, invalidity pension, unemployability supplement and blind pension. That is a good move and I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the improvements as they relate to qualified adults. Again, this is something we need to fundamentally consider &ndash; that adults are described as dependants of other adults. People should have payments in their own right. They should not have to be dependants; they are adults entitled to the dignity of being described as other than dependants. We need to move further in that area.</P>
    <P>Another point made by various Deputies is that people who got increases, and who will get increases, under this and other social welfare Bills have their rents increased by local authorities. Someone came to me recently who had her diet supplement cut, which was means tested, because she had received an increase in her social welfare payments. Because of her particular physical condition she needed special foods yet her diet supplement was cut. That is yet another anomaly. This was done through the Department of Health and Children, <i>via </i>the health board, rather than through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Nevertheless, there is a principle, and other Members have referred to this, where other agencies make cuts when people get social welfare increases. Something should be done across the board with local authorities, health boards, etc.</P>
    <P>In the time remaining, I want to address the question of child care. I welcome the increase provided for in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill. However, there is an attempt to use child benefit as a means of dealing with the cost of child care. It is a pity the Government did not introduce a parental child care payment in addition to the increase in child benefit. The real cost to parents, whether they go out to work and pay for child care or do without a second salary, or even a first salary in the case of a single parent, by staying at home with the children, means that they are losing out substantially. While I welcome the increase in child benefit, it does not address the real costs of child care. If the Government genuinely wants to support families, it should have sought to introduce the kind of payment to which I refer which was recommended by a number of organisations.</P>
    <P>There are some good provisions in the Bill but the inequalities in society are increasing. The Bill is an opportunity lost in this time of plenty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy John McGuinness.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. As the Minister said, the Government is committed to looking after our children, older people and carers and all who are dependent on the social welfare system. The Bill is proof of this and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for bringing it into the House.</P>
      <P>The issue of carers has been mentioned by a number of speakers. The carers allowance has improved since 1990, when it was first introduced. I, like other Members, look forward to the day when the carer's allowance will not involve a means test. However, we have come a long way since 1990, introducing respite care, for example, which has increased from £100 to £400, and free travel for carers and also relaxing the residency conditions.</P>
      <P>One important improvement is that carers have been allowed to take up employment for ten hours a week and to get involved in the back to education initiatives. I also welcome the introduction by the Government of the Carer's Leave Bill and the extension of the free electricity scheme and other schemes to carers.</P>
      <P>We discussed the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subvention. There would be fewer people in nursing homes if the carer's allowance was improved and if a better housing aid for the elderly scheme was provided by the health boards and the local authorities. Even though one might prefer if the carer's allowance was provided by the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has done much work to ensure that the scheme would be improved.</P>
      <P>Other schemes for the elderly in which the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is involved include the provision of alarms and security pendants through the community alert scheme. The Deputy has done a great deal of good work and great credit is due to the Minister for what he has done.</P>
      <P>In the child care area, the Bill provides for increases in child benefit of £25 for the first and second child and of £30 for the third and subsequent children from June, which involves paying these increases a month earlier than in previous years. I welcome the earlier payment of the increases because it is an issue we all hear about on the doorsteps and in our clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the question of <i>pro rata</i> pensions with the Minister on a number of occasions. For a number of years we have known that farmers and the self-employed have had difficulties in achieving ten years' contributions and they have fallen behind other sectors which are entitled to contributory pensions. The Minister introduced the <i>pro rata</i> pension where the contributions before 1953 were included, but unfortunately there are still people who are losing out. Only last week I came across the case of a person who was eight contributions short. There should be some way in which such a person could purchase those contri<Col N="158" /> butions or be entitled to some form of pension. There is no such provision made in this legislation and I hope that issue can be addressed soon in another Bill because it is unfortunate that such people are losing out in that way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction by the Minister of the extension of living alone allowances to people with disabilities under 66 years of age. To date, this applied only to old age pensioners over 66 years. I also welcome the fact that where a person must go into a nursing home and must sell his or her house, the ceiling of the exemption from the means test of £75,000 is being increased to £150,000.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the Minister introduced a provision to help people living on the islands. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, was very involved in this when he was Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I wish him well in his new position and I also wish Deputy Coughlan well in her new role.</P>
    <P>There are many people returning to live on the islands and they incur great expense when it comes to housing, whether in new or refurbished houses. Some people, for example, must generate their own electricity and that is just one challenge.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving an extra £10 to pensioners living on the islands. This was recommended by the interdepartmental committee on the islands in the Gaeltacht. It was also included in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the last election and I know it has been welcomed by the people on the islands.</P>
    <P>One issue relevant to social welfare recipients which arises time and again is the question of participation on community employment schemes or FÁS schemes. Naturally when the economy is going well there will be a shortage of workers but people on social welfare should be allowed return to those schemes as quickly as possible. Currently one must be unemployed for a year to qualify for a scheme and that is not good enough. Even people who have been laid off are told that they must wait a year and if they have spent three years in social employment, they may not return to the scheme. It is difficult, in particular, for small farmers with small holdings who would like to get employment near their homes. At a time when we are telling farmers that they should look for part-time employment if their farms do not provide enough income, it would make good sense for them to be employed as close to their homes as possible. The Government could improve the situation by allowing people on social welfare to return to those schemes quickly.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister said about the family income supplement, which is a great way of helping low income families. There is an increase of £25 at each point in the FIS scale. This increase of £25 and the weekly income thresholds will give nearly all existing FIS recipients an additional £15. It will help 17,500 families at a <Col N="159" /> cost of £30 million in a full year. I welcome the fact that these improvements will come into effect from 5 April because the date of payment in this case has been brought forward also.</P>
    <P>The Department provides grants to voluntary and community organisations. I welcome the provision of such grants to people in rural areas. People on social welfare have derived great benefit from these grants. Recently I visited an enterprise centre which the Minister opened in Lawrencetown near Ballinasloe which has greatly benefited the community. We were honoured to have the Minister open that centre. I hope this scheme to which I refer will continue for all the community groups looking for assistance because they cannot get assistance from sources other than the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the free schemes to people aged 70 or over and the fact that now medical cards will be available to this age category. Many organisations throughout the country sought this extension of these schemes and also improvements in the fuel scheme. The fuel scheme will be extended by three weeks. That is welcome. I hope the amount for the fuel scheme will be considered because there has been an increase in fuel costs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It shows the Government is committed to caring for the less well-off in society. There is a total package of £850 million in a full year and the Minister should insist it is directed to those most in need. I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the efforts by the Government in the budget to ensure a huge investment is made in this area to improve the schemes available to those within the social welfare system and to relax some of the criteria laid down for them. It is a good Bill, involving a sum of £850 million which will give great benefit across the board. I am glad to see the increases were in money terms rather than in percentages. For too long we have given increases on a percentage basis. The budget and this Bill change that for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has overseen radical change in the delivery of the social welfare services, and I compliment him and his staff on that. I compliment not only the staff at national level but those involved at every level on a daily basis. The approach of the Department has changed, it has become much more user-friendly. I remember when politicians in this House could make a name for themselves by ensuring benefits were paid or were paid on time. Now one has only to ring the Department or call into a local office and problems that were once insurmountable are easily overcome. That did not happen overnight and the Minister has put his shoulder to the wheel to ensure the type of change which needed to happen within the Department to deliver the range of services available. He has done a wonderful <Col N="160" /> job in co-operation with his staff. It has also involved information technology which I notice is used throughout the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department is an example to others when it comes to the parliamentary questions system. Not only does one receive a reply to a parliamentary question within a day, one sometimes receives one within a number of hours. The replies are accurate and offer help and assistance to the people who raised the matters concerned with Members. That underlines the radical changes which have taken place and which have improved the levels of service immensely. That message should be carried to staff to encourage them and to ensure further efforts are made to continue to overhaul and change the Department.</P>
    <P>The main provision in the Bill is the care being extended to pensioners. I have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that previous generations made a huge contribution to the country and did not receive the proper level of pension. In a time of plenty the budget has recognised the efforts of those men and women who, in the difficult times when they did not have plenty, worked to enable us to be in a position to reap the rewards. It is time for us to increase pensions substantially. The old age pension was £78 in 1997 and is now £106. Fianna Fáil said in its manifesto that it had a target of £100 by 2002. Having reached this target and having underlined our commitment to the elderly, it is time to review that target upwards. It is realistic to reach £150 in the short term. It is the least that can be expected when it is forecast that the economy will continue to grow.</P>
    <P>Alongside that, I would like the Government, through the Minister's Department, to ensure the benefits of and increases in the budget are not taken from the elderly population by local government. That can be done by increases in local charges, such as refuse collection charges, rental increases and library fees. These are things which mean little to us but are a serious financial burden on the elderly. I would like to see a mechanism established whereby the increases will not affect the range of services of which the elderly avail within local authorities. Those I mentioned are obvious but I am sure there are many more with which we could deal. Were that to be done, it would make the increases more meaningful to the elderly.</P>
    <P>The senior citizens' parliament is established throughout the country. It is quite active in Dublin. A branch of the parliament was recently established in Kilkenny city. I found that the members attending the parliament, as they call it, had a substantial amount of information and experience to offer which would influence our line of thought on our treatment of the elderly. It would be no harm to include that parliament in the budget consultation process. Those people have something important and constructive to contribute. They are the generations which should benefit from budgets. Rather than writing it down, we should be more imaginative and ask these customers their opinion of the service we <Col N="161" /> offer, the increases and where they should apply. It would be a worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>I have constantly made the point that, although we are a well-off economy, there are still people on the margins not doing so well. Those who seem to be overlooked live in rural Ireland. A number of people are still trying to remain active in farming when they are old age pensioners. They try to eke out a living on their own or as a couple whose family have gone away. I have encountered poverty at that level I did not believe existed. Having canvassed a section of north Kilkenny, because we are informed by parish pump politics, I was amazed at the number of older people living alone, sometimes in fear because there is little security in rural areas. They live alone with little means or ways of making money. Some try to keep a small holding together. A study should be conducted of the numbers of people who are affected by the fact that they own some land and yet have little means by which to live. They are a generation of people who are proud of what they did over the years and are not anxious to push themselves forward to gain from the State. They are a quiet minority, yet they exist. As a society, we will be judged by how we care for the weaker and poorer sections in the community. We are never rich while our brother is poor.</P>
    <P>Carers are another group in which I have an interest and I am glad the numbers of carers qualifying have increased from 9,000 to 17,000. Those are the numbers caring for the elderly, sick or the retired in the community. While the numbers are huge, I appreciate what the Minister has done in the budget with income disregards and increasing the allowance means test threshold from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. The rate of pay has also been increased.</P>
    <P>Other measures also support carers, though more can be done. In my constituency there is a carers' office. This means that the Carers Association has a presence on the high street. That body does a lot of voluntary work, engages in fund-raising and tries to link carers by way of proper communication, giving them information they require. It is helped by various health boards in carrying out its work and interacting with carers funded by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, but more can be done. Eddie Collins-Hughes is an active representative for that organisation, but it tends to come to Leinster House at the last minute before a budget. It should come earlier to establish exactly what it wants and its agenda. We could then fund the work it prioritises as a result of working with carers daily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Neville.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have mentioned the budget. They started off by praising the Minister before going on to tell him about the faults in the budget. Members mentioned the fuel allowance, which is <Col N="162" /> the greatest joke of all time. People received the allowance for an extra three weeks this year under that scheme, but the cold weather in Ireland means one needs a fire for 51 weeks of the year. We are lucky to get three or four fine days, but those on the scheme received the allowance for a further three weeks. Do departmental officials realise the price of gas or a bag of fuel? Every Fianna Fáil speaker says how wonderful the Minister is, but they must be living in their flats in Spain, as they are, certainly, not living in Geesala in Mayo or Kilkenny city, where it rains for 51 weeks out of 52. One needs a fire, but the best they can do is give the elderly £5 per week and extend the scheme by three weeks. We have a fanfare from the Minister and press releases from the spin doctors, but I do not agree with this. It is a disgrace and a kick in the face for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Last week we discussed nursing home subventions, when people were mugged by the Government and State employees. If that happened on the streets of Dublin, it would be headline news. Because it was done by the State it is as if it were half all right, but it is not. We have short memories if we attack the elderly because we will be old someday. Then we will be judged by what this and other Governments do for the elderly. The best we can do is give them £5 and extend the fuel scheme by three weeks, when a bag of coal costs £8 or £8.50 in Mayo &ndash; I do not know what it costs in Dublin &ndash; but that bag of coal does not last too long when one needs to have a fire on 51 weeks out of 52, if we are lucky. It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>There was a big furore about the free schemes, but what good is a bus or rail pass for a person in a rural area? It is wonderful if one is in Dublin as one can hop on the DART or Dublin Bus, but there is no DART in rural Ireland and in some cases there are no buses because Bus Éireann has let us down; there is no public transport. The next budget is in October and I ask the departmental officials to consider those facts.</P>
    <P>It is time the Department used some imagination and gave old people a voucher or pass they can use with a taxi if there are no buses or trains. Give them some money to hire a taxi for whatever day they go to town to collect their pension. We have heard about the increased payments to the elderly, but Deputy McGuinness is right about elderly people. They like their security and if they are going to town, they like to know they have a lift or taxi in and out. If they live five miles from town, the taxi will cost them £1.50 or £2 per mile. It, therefore, costs £10 to get in and out; that is their increase gone immediately. Inflation was running at approximately 10% last month. The Government and its spin doctors were saying 8%, but one could add 2% to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">

      <P>The Department could not even give free fuel to those over 70 years of age. There are means tests. It reminds me of the situation in north Mayo, an area which lost over 300 jobs last year, where a social welfare inspector said people had to go and find work as there was work available. That inspector received travel expenses going down and coming back. He had to go down a second time because I tabled a parliamentary question on the matter, as a result of which he received more travel expenses. He received more in expenses going up and down to north Mayo than those on social welfare received.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's office when I tabled that question. It was a simple question: all I asked was whether those in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs could identify where the jobs were in north Mayo. The spin doctors in that Department spun it out again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see now why they are getting £70,000 per annum from Fianna Fáil. They are good at spinning. However, people are waiting for Fianna Fáil and the spin doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why will the Department not extend the free fuel scheme to those over 70 years of age without having to undergo a means test? I ask the Mini<Col N="164" /> ster of State to look at that matter. If the member of a married couple in receipt of a free scheme dies and the surviving partner is just under the age limit, why is the person immediately taken off the scheme? Why is the scheme not extended to the person for six to eight months? A person who loses a partner also loses the benefit of the scheme. It is time that was examined, as the person should get the benefit of the scheme for another six to eight months to break the loss. It is bad enough losing a partner.</P>
    <P>I heard all speakers talk about the poor carers. If the carers are depending on the Government regarding the means test for carers, then God help the elderly. Why will the Government not introduce a system where the first £50 will not be means tested, as a way of recognising the wonderful work these people do? What would any of us do if we were had to care for an old person for two months, two years or ten years?</P>
    <P>I do not know what action should be taken in respect of our many carers but it is obvious that the Government is doing nothing for them. If a carer's husband or partner is working, the carer will be means tested on that basis and he or she will not receive any financial reward for looking after the person needing care. That is wrong and there is a need to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>This is the first Government since the foundation of the State with access to money. Previous Administrations had to search for funds and allocate them in a piecemeal fashion.</P>

      <P>What is the Government doing? It is giving more money to the rich. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, looked after the rich in the past four budgets. The rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer and the weak are getting weaker because the Government does not care about them. The Government is only concerned about catering for the needs of the rich and the people who will subscribe to its election campaign. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>My final point relates to alarms. Next year the Department, as a favour to me, should pay the £52 monitoring charge for elderly people. Perhaps next year I will say nice things about the officials of the Department because we might be on the opposite side of the House and the spin doctors will be working for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I will deal with the area to which Deputy Ring referred, namely, the issue of carers who are the forgotten people. They make an enormous contribution to society and make tremendous sacrifices to care for their loved ones. Many individuals gave up their opportunities in life to care for a parent, a brother or sister. When <Col N="165" /> the person for whom they were caring eventually died, life has almost passed them by. These people do not have the opportunity to socialise in the same way as those who are not obliged or decide not to care for someone.</P>
      <P>Carers do an enormous service for the State and for their loved ones. In that context, I will deal with the means test and the approach taken by the State and the Government. The Government should not ask what carers have, it should ask what they need. I support the Carers' Association in its call for the Government to completely overhaul the current support system for carers, including scrapping the carer's allowance, which is failing Ireland's 120,000 family carers, and replace it with a non-means tested carer's payment. According to Government figures there are approximately 22,000 people obtaining carer's allowance. However, the Carers' Association estimates that there are 120,000 carers. On that basis, the work of almost 100,000 carers is not being recognised by the State. It is time the contribution made by these people was recognised and I call on the Government to do so.</P>
      <P>Carer's allowance will be paid to only one in six carers if the meagre changes in the Social Welfare Bill become law. Carers should not have to wait any longer for proper recognition from the State. The carer's allowance scheme must be replaced as a matter of urgency. The work of every carer should be recognised. The argument will be put forward that the very rich will also then be entitled to payment. However, the very rich can afford to pay for nurses and services for a person requiring care. Many carers give up opportunities in life, job or career in order to care for a loved one.</P>
      <P>The Government sees very little scope for developing the carer's allowance. At the current rate of change to the means test, it would take almost 20 years to bring all carers into the scheme. Carers need urgent support, they simply cannot wait. These people are doing their best to maintain the independence and dignity of their frail and incapacitated relatives in their homes. This should be recognised in Government policy. For every pound the Government spends in supporting carers in the home, carers save the State £12 on the cost of alternative residential care. That fact is not recognised by the State.</P>
      <P>The Government should reinforce its policy by providing support and recognition for carers. The best approach would be to scrap the carer's allowance and introduce a carer's payment which would avoid the need for means test and target support to carers based on their needs and those of the people for whom they care. This would demonstrate a serious commitment on the part of the Government to encouraging care in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for urgent consideration of the difficulties experienced by carers and particular attention should be paid to the area of respite. Certain people provide care on a 24 hour basis, which is the nature of the job. These individuals <Col N="166" /> are available, even late at night or in the early hours of the morning, to provide assistance if a loved one becomes ill or requires something. They are available and on call at all times. A structured system of respite care should be put in place. Carers should be released from their duties for at least 20 hours per week in order that they can enjoy some relief from the stress and pressures they experience.</P>
    <P>We must also consider providing other types of assistance to carers, particularly in terms of the way they manage the stress and psychological pressures involved in caring and the way they deal with difficulties which might arise. I am familiar with a number of families whose members cared for loved ones from the moment they contracted Alzheimer's disease until their eventual death. These people were obliged to deal with many traumas and difficulties when they undertook this enormous task, but they did so out of love for their relatives. Special assistance should be provided to people who care for loved ones with specific needs.</P>
    <P>Another area we must examine is that of dealing with people, particularly parents, who care for handicapped children or adults. These people, frequently mothers, are often forgotten and who, since they married, did not ever work outside the home and are not considered to be carers. Many mothers can return to work when their children reach 16, 17, 18 or 19 years of age. However, those mothers who care for handicapped relatives &ndash; I accept that fathers do so, in some instances &ndash; do not have an opportunity to do so. We must recognise the needs of parents of mentally and physically handicapped children and young people because they do an enormous service, which they see as part of their duty, for the State and their loved ones.</P>
    <P>Another area to which I refer is that of parents who are obliged to deal with children with attention deficit disorders. One cannot imagine the difficulties, stress and pressure endured by a parent who must deal on an ongoing basis with a child suffering from such a disorder. Because she has taken an interest in that area as Minister with responsibility for children, the Minister of State is aware of the stress parents experience in trying to get a school for their child, of the stress they experience because of the child's difficulties in school, and afterwards when the child becomes an adolescent and comes up against the problem of drugs and, often, crime. Many experience difficulties because their child is in prison. I know such people. I know one person experiencing difficulty and stress as a result of an only child with attention deficit disorder dying by suicide due to the stress the child was experiencing because of the disorder. I ask the Minister to recognise the work of carers and introduce a carer's payment. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to contribute.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Cecilia Keaveney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> One would think, listening to Deputy Ring, that everything in the budget and in the Social Welfare Bill before us was wrong. One would not think that since Fianna Fáil came into Government it increased spending on social welfare from £4.5 billion in 1997 to just over £6 billion in 2000, an increase of more than one third in just four years. I understand the role of the Opposition is to oppose. However, it should do so constructively. The £850 million package provided by the Government for social welfare improvements is more than twice that in last year's social welfare package, and four times that provided in the budget of the rainbow coalition in 1997. The Social Welfare Bill should be supported by all Members of the House. It is a very progressive Bill designed to introduce key changes in our social welfare code as announced in the budget before Christmas.</P>
    <P>We should recall at this juncture that this Government, in assuming office in July 1997, made it a priority to help the less well off in our society. No Government in a civil or dignified society is worth a pinch of salt unless it brings forward legislative proposals and initiatives which help those who cannot help themselves while providing opportunities for those in need of them. Our social welfare code protects pensioners and those who are disabled. It helps to protect children in our society.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to introducing progressive and innovative changes to our social welfare code, and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on bringing about so much change to our existing social welfare code. The so-called Celtic tiger has brought about increased economic growth, but this is a question of macro-economics. The benefits of the so-called Celtic tiger have not seeped down to all sectors of our society. That is why we must ensure that we protect the poor, the elderly, the sick and those who are disadvantaged. That is why we should support the provisions of this Social Welfare Bill. I am confident that when the Government introduces another budget later this year, it will continue with its programme of social welfare reform.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill cannot be looked at in isolation from other changes announced in the budget before Christmas. It cannot be viewed separately from broader Government programmes.</P>
    <P>The changes announced by the Government in the field of taxation have benefited the poorest in our society. As a result of the tax changes announced in the budget, a further 176,000 people will not have to pay income tax. While all employees will be better off as a result of the recently announced tax changes, the primary beneficiaries will be lower income families. No <Col N="168" /> worker will pay tax on the first £144 earned per week. A single taxpayer earning £12,500 per year will gain up to £42 per month in take-home pay. The changes in the income tax code will ensure that the gap between rich and poor does not widen. It will also ensure that the real benefits of income tax changes seep down to people who are in most need of them. Other tax changes which will help the poorest in society include the abolition of probate tax, a tax which discriminated against the poorest in our society in practical terms.</P>
    <P>In the field of education, the back to education allowances will be extended to people aged between 18 and 20 who have been in receipt of unemployment or lone parent's payment for at least six months and who have been out of the education system for a period of two years. There will also be increased access to the back to education allowance for all people with a disability.</P>
    <P>On the specific changes to the social welfare schemes announced in the budget, the largest increases in social welfare benefits in the history of the State were announced by this Government. This Government is committed to improving the quality of living for the elderly. Pensioners aged 66 or over will receive an increase of £10 a week in the value of their pension entitlements. The free schemes, which include electricity and gas allowances, a free television licence and free telephone, will be extended to all people over the age of 70 regardless of their income or of who lives with them. This last initiative is particularly important. The free schemes programme will ensure that the elderly will not have to pay for such important necessities out of their annual entitlements. This is a particularly enlightening initiative and one which can be expanded upon in the years ahead. The Government has also granted entitlement to a medical card to all people over 70 years of age. This is a serious sign of serious political intent to guarantee that the quality of living for the elderly in our society is improved at every opportunity. From the perspective of my constituency, I welcome the Government's allocation this week of £1.15 million for special aids for the elderly living in the mid-western region. This will also go some way to improving the quality of living for the elderly.</P>
    <P>A separate but equally important matter is how best we can address the issue of carers in society. This is an issue which the Minister has sought to champion at every opportunity. He is achieving good, solid, political progress in improving the rights and financial support which carers receive from the Government. In the budget in December last, it was announced that there would be a change in the means test for the carer's allowance which will ensure that an extra 5,000 extra carers will benefit. The annual respite care grant will be increased by £100 to £400. Carers who look after more than one person will <Col N="169" /> receive a respite care grant of £800. The fact that tax relief will be available to an individual in respect of medical expenses incurred on behalf of a dependent relative will help reduce financial outlays committed by carers on a weekly basis. These changes in the financial levels of the carer's allowance coincide with the enactment of the Government's new Carer's Leave Bill. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for a new entitlement for employees to avail of temporary unpaid leave to enable them to care for a person who requires full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognises the need to financially help parents to raise their children. That is why I particularly welcome the increases in the level of financial support for child care, announced in last year's budget. The new monthly child benefit rate is £67.50 for each of the first two children and £86 per months for the third and subsequent children. To put these increases in the context of all the increases provided over the past six budgets, increases of £25 and £30 compare starkly with the £1 and £5 increases given by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance in the last rainbow coalition Government.</P>

      <P>Although I am on this side of the House, I often criticise what has not been done. However, when things are being done, it is only fair that credit be given where it is due. I wish to correct a statement by Deputy Ring that I and other Members are working from scripts that are prepared for us by spin doctors. The only reason I answer that criticism is that it reached the newspapers on one occasion. I have a certain level of intelligence and can put together a few words. I never rely on spin doctors or anybody else to form my opinions, as anybody who listens to me will confirm.</P>
      <P>Last year I thought I was commending an excellent Social Welfare Bill. It was an excellent Bill and provided for £403 million worth of improvements that would benefit all sectors of society. I must have been wrong, however, because this year there is an increase of £850 million. Any member of the Opposition who cannot acknowledge that must be extremely petty. There are always issues to be dealt with. We would not be in this job and there would be no Ministers if there were no issues to be tackled. To claim, however, that nothing is happening, that everybody is losing out and that the world is in a desperate situation is contrary to what Europe and the people on the ground are telling us. If that amount of money is being spent, it must be benefiting people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to outline my concerns and to voice my appreciation of the work the Minister, Deputy Ahern, and the Government are doing. When I was elected to the Dáil a brief five years ago the increase in children's allowance <Col N="170" /> was the princely sum of 25p per week or £1 per month. Deputy Broughan referred to them today as historical days, but I am talking about the years 1996 and 1997. Now the Government is introducing a £25 per month increase in children's allowance. It is a significant increase that will have real repercussions for all people, regardless of whether they are on low incomes or working couples who must pay for child care. No matter what situation a person is in, a £25 per month increase for the first and second children and a £30 increase for the third and subsequent children are serious increases which must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The fact that these increases will be paid earlier than in other years has been missed by many speakers. Increases were often announced previously, but it was many months before they were paid. In this case, the Minister has made great strides in bringing forward the date of payment. I welcome this.</P>
    <P>We can gripe that we would like the £10 per week increase for pensioners to be £100 or £1,000, but it is a significant and well deserved increase. It fulfils a commitment in the programme for Government and proves that we are delivering on what we promised at the last general election. One matter that is only now coming to people's attention is the extension of the free schemes to all people over 70 years of age. I am nearly sure that people will have to apply for the free schemes and the medical card, but perhaps the Minister will clarify if this could happen automatically. Do people have to apply? What type of advertising will there be ensure everybody who is entitled to these benefits will receive them? Many people who attend my clinics have only lately realised that life will get much easier for them as a result of these changes. It is not just a benefit for the well-off; it is a benefit for everybody and it is most welcome.</P>
    <P>The £10 per week increase in the old age pension is important as is the £25 per month increase in child benefit, but the increase in the FIS threshold of £25 per week is equally important. One of the most innovative changes is the new approach to maternity and adoptive benefits. This has had a major and positive effect on the lives of many young couples. The fact that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, worked together to implement it from March is welcome. Maternity and adoptive benefits have been extended by four weeks to 18 weeks in the case of maternity benefit and 14 weeks for adoptive benefit. This will have a significant impact.</P>
    <P>There is an additional allowance of £10 per week for pensioners living on offshore islands. This gives me the opportunity to welcome the appointment of Deputy Coughlan as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands with responsibility for the islands. It was a correct and good decision and it <Col N="171" /> will be lauded not only in Donegal, but throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Carers have been the subject of much discussion in this Chamber. We regularly talk about what has not happened for them. That was particularly the case in the context of the Carer's Leave Bill. While I accept that more can be done, it is time to acknowledge what is being done. The £10 and £8 increases in the allowances from April will provide significant assistance for carers. The change in the means test allows 5,000 extra carers to qualify. The increases of £50 per week for single persons and £100 per week for couples in the income disregards, bringing them to £125 and £250 per week respectively, come into effect from April and are extremely important.</P>
    <P>The annual respite care grant was not even mentioned by Deputy Ring. When it was introduced it amounted to £200; it is now £400. Carers who look after more than one person will receive a grant of £800 for respite care from June 2001. This cannot be belittled. It is an important, deserved, necessary and most welcome innovation by the Minister for whom carers have been a key focus. He has done a great deal for them and will do more in the future.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the fuel allowance. For many years I supported an increase in the fuel allowance until I discussed it at length with the Minister. I understand his view, although I will always support increases across the board. However, where somebody is receiving £5 per week for a certain length of time and it is increased to £10 per week for the same length of time, but is then removed when that time is elapsed, it can be a serious blow. It means the person's income is reduced and they have £10 less to spend. It is important that the £10 increase is given for the 52 weeks of the year to the pensioner. One can opt for increasing the fuel allowance, with which I agree, but if a larger increase can be secured over 52 weeks of the year, it will not leave anybody feeling they have been deprived of a certain amount of money to which they became accustomed over X number of weeks.</P>
    <P>There is significant support in the budget for foster care. I congratulate the Minister on recognising this very important issue and bringing it to the fore. For too long, it has been quietly avoided. I know the agencies dealing with foster care appreciate what is being done. They have questions which they want clarified, which I will bring to the Minister's attention. I appreciate this brief opportunity to speak on this very positive Bill. I look forward to the increases, which are worth some £850 million, coming into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to highlight the shortage of trained teachers in primary schools in disadvantaged areas. This is a major problem for schools designated as disadvantaged in my constituency and other urban areas. For three successive years, such schools in west Tallaght, for example, have found it impossible to attract trained teachers. At the same time, there has been an exodus of trained teachers to relatively more affluent areas where the demands of the job are somewhat more straightforward. There are even cases where teachers have gone to temporary positions in those areas, rather than accept or remain in permanent posts in schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to one primary school where, of 32 staff members, only 9 have spent longer than 18 months in that school and only 16 have been there for more than six months. I know of schools in the area which have simply failed in recent years to attract teachers to fill their staffing complement. It is not at all untypical to have one quarter of staff untrained. In one such school, no fewer than 21 trained staff have left since the beginning of 1999. Only nine trained teachers have been appointed to replace them.</P>
      <P>I would like to believe the Minister and the relevant staff in the Department of Education and Science understand the socio-economic environment of these schools. Untrained teachers cannot reasonably be expected to cope with mainstream classes, because of discipline problems. As a result, they tend to be inappropriately assigned to special needs, where the number of pupils is smaller. One cannot exaggerate the extent of abuse that such teachers are expected to survive from a small minority of pupils.</P>
      <P>These schools have been excellent in accepting all pupils, including Traveller children, emotionally disturbed children and children with specific learning difficulties. These schools acknowledge good work done by the Department and by successive Ministers for Education to address the attendant difficulties which arise. However, much of the good work done over the past six or seven years is now at risk if the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, does not act speedily to address the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to imagine the outcry from parents and community leaders if children in more socially advantaged areas had such a high proportion of untrained teachers. Privilege is still transmitted in this society by educational opportunity. Children in disadvantaged areas do not have equal opportunity. Children schooled in the circumstances which I have described certainly do not have equal opportunity. The disruption and uncertainty in such situations and the undesirability of a disproportionate complement of <Col N="173" /> untrained teachers, warrant priority attention by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I look forward to learning whether the Minister has a grasp of the situation which I have described and to hearing what action he proposes to take. One school in my constituency has no less than 107 pupils with special needs. That is more than the total number of pupils one might find in a special school. That kind of school requires and deserves special attention. While not disparaging the commitment of untrained teachers, it is unfair to both teachers and children to have a school so reliant on untrained teachers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline what actions he proposes to take. The Department of Education and Science got it wrong some years ago in predicting teacher numbers. As a result, teaching posts are now vacant in several schools and those in disadvantaged areas are being denuded of trained teachers because they are going to schools in more socially advantaged areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position in relation to the matters which he has raised. The figures he gave are quite stark in relation to the schools in his constituency. The Department of Education and Science is aware that a number of primary schools throughout the country are experiencing difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers in the current school year. This has arisen because of two main factors: (1) this Government has increased demand for teachers generally by creating extra posts to reduce the pupil teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage. Since taking office, the Government has created an extra 1,875 teaching posts. The creation of these posts has exacerbated supply problems; (2) the number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges had fallen to a very low level. For example, 291 graduated in 1995. This Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-2001 academic year. A further post-graduate course is commencing this month with an intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280.</P>
      <P>The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for a number of years. However, these projections will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, taking account of enrolment trends and changes in demand requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years, it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in <Col N="174" /> the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification, are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders with the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU-trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Department of Education and Science has provided that these teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by the Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU-trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori-trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas college, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. Other factors exacerbating the shortage at present is the introduction of the early retirement scheme for teachers under the PCW, the availability of career breaks and job-sharing for teachers.</P>
    <P>Primary teachers are employed by boards of management of individual schools. As employers, boards have the authority to refuse career breaks or job-sharing to teachers in their schools. There are currently 950 teachers on career breaks. With regard to the high turnover of teachers in schools designated as disadvantaged, the difficulties with teacher shortage and teacher movement are not confined to disadvantaged schools alone. I share the Deputy's sentiment that educational opportunity is crucial for every child, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. I am confident that the measures this Government has taken as outlined will help to ensure that the current difficulties being experienced by schools will be resolved.</P>

      <P>Some pupils who attend Kilcummin national school have learning difficulties. The management, staff and pupils of the school are endeavouring to ensure that these children receive the education they deserve by right. However, the school cannot achieve this goal without a full-time special needs assistant. The school has been campaigning for this post for some time. I have been informed that the chief inspector promised a full-time special needs assistant for the school. However, that vital resource has not been delivered. The school has only received sanction for a part-time assistant working three hours per day.</P>
      <P>One of the students who needs help is extremely weak academically and is unable to work on her own, even for the shortest time. This student has already repeated two classes for the second time and it appears she will be unable to handle third class next year. She is extremely quiet and lacks self-confidence. The part-time assistant provided by the Department will spend only one hour per day with this pupil.</P>
      <P>Another pupil in need of assistance has been allocated two hours per day with the special needs assistant. This pupil has co-ordination problems and needs full-time assistance. He finds it difficult to take correction and screams and shouts, causing great disturbance to teachers and pupils. Ideally the school would like to offer pupils a full-time special needs assistant. However, recognising the problem of resources, the school sought one full-time position to cover the obvious needs of both pupils.</P>
      <P>The school has appealed the Department's decision and I fully support that appeal. I hope the Minister will be in a position to announce that the Department will take its responsibilities to these children seriously and provide a full-time special needs assistant for the school. It beggars belief, given the healthy position of the State's finances, that the educational rights of children are being hampered. Is this due to a lack of resources? If we cannot use the fruits of prosperity to provide basic services to those who have been denied them for years, the Celtic tiger is not worth a curse.</P>
      <P>It is essential the Minister takes hold of this issue. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that it is absurd to expect the pupils and staff of Kilcummin national school to make do with a part-time special needs teacher for three hours per day. The rate of pay for the job is so low that extending the post to a full-time position is not going to break the bank or the Department.</P>
      <P>Let there be no evasion on this issue. Kilcummin national school deserves a full-time special needs assistant. It should not have to move heaven and earth to get this basic facility. It is time for the Minister to show some common sense and compassion and grant a full-time post immediately. The school inspector has appealed to the Department for a full-time post and I hope the Minister will accede to the request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> The principal, teachers and the inspector agree that a full-time special needs assistant is required and everyone except the Minister is of the opinion that three hours per day is not enough for these unfortunate pupils. I appeal to the Minister to give these pupils what they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to set out the position. Special needs assistants are allocated to schools to support class teachers in catering for children who have been professionally assessed as having special educational needs which require such support. The duties of the special needs assistant include helping children who encounter particular difficulties in areas such as mobility, using the toilet and hygiene. Special needs assistants can also be employed to assist children with disabilities in boarding and alighting from school buses.</P>
      <P>All allocations of special needs assistant support are based on the assessed needs of the individual children involved. In some cases the needs of an individual pupil or group of pupils may be of such severity as to warrant the allocation of a special needs assistant on a full-time basis. In other cases the level of special needs assistant support required can be adequately addressed through an allocation of part-time hours support. Each case is assessed on its merits.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to their needs, including the support of special needs assistants where required. As a result of this decision, the number of special needs assistants in place in the primary system has increased from less than 300 in October 1998 to more than 1,700 at present. It is important that credit is given where it is due for the expansion of this service. Further such posts are being allocated on an on-going basis as needs are identified.</P>
      <P>All primary schools have been notified of the procedures to be followed in seeking support services for children with disabilities, including special needs assistant supports. The procedures in question require that the school make application for support through the local schools inspector. In each case, the school is required to identify the children in respect of whom the special needs assistant support is being sought and to provide available professional assessment reports in relation to the children in question. The case put forward by the school is then considered by the local schools inspector who advises the Department on the level of support required in the particular case. The decision is made based on the inspector's recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Kilcummin national school, an application to the Department of Education and Science for special needs assistant support has recently been considered by the Department's inspectorate. Arising from this consideration, the Department recently made an allocation of 15 <Col N="177" /> hours per week special needs assistant support to the school to meet the needs of two pupils who were identified as requiring such a service. I presume they are the two pupils referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>As in all such cases, the Department of Education and Science would be prepared to review the allocation made to the school in the event that additional children are identified and assessed as requiring special needs assistant support at the school.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue which has been raised previously in the Dáil. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, for being present to respond.</P>
      <P>This week in the High Court Mr. Justice Peter Kelly said that the State's record on troubled children had &ldquo;descended to new levels of farce&rdquo;. He was concerned about a situation where a 13 year old and a 14 year old boy were placed in hotels. He was informed that there were no places available for them for months. He said that he would not lend the court's approval to the detention of troubled children, some of whom have a propensity to violence, in a less than secure facility. He also said that he had grave concerns about the security of other hotel guests.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, that is but one in a series of cases about which concern has been expressed. I will give the House other examples which illustrate that residential child care is in crisis. A troubled 13 year old boy was held in a Dublin Garda station for five days. A teenage girl was detained at the Central Mental Hospital. A 15 year old boy was forced to sleep in Pearse Street Garda station, while a 14 year old spent a number of nights in Waterford Garda station. It is clear that young people who are most at risk are staying in a variety of accommodation, including Garda stations, bed and breakfast establishments, hotels and psychiatric hospitals instead of the high care secure facilities in which they should be placed which offer good therapeutic help. I ask the Minister of State to explain to the public the numbers of children at risk who are being placed in such accommodation. Can she explain to the public the reason places are not being provided and when the Government intends to provide them? </P>
      <P>It is clear the situation is unacceptable. There have been crises in many sectors, whether it be the agricultural sector or others, which can be responded to by Government. Why is this not being regarded as a crisis? Why has an emergency package of measures not been announced to deal with it? We have a national children's strategy, but it rings hollows when the day-to-day position facing some of our most vulnerable people is exposed in this way. Action can be taken which could make a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister of State will indi<Col N="178" /> cate that residential child care is going through a difficult period. Staff working in this front-line area must be adequately rewarded and supported and trained. New initiatives to recruit and train staff must be put in place. I refer the Minister of State to Austria where this issue has been tackled. Many people want to work in this area, but they must have the supports in place to enable them to do so. In Austria, for example, appealing courses have been put together. Support has been given to workers in this area which means there is no shortage of workers willing to do this difficult work.</P>
    <P>We have a problem which must be tackled. The Government and society must recognise the invaluable work child care and residential workers are doing. There is no doubt that for too long social services have been the poor cousin. Just as we need careful planning to implement infrastructural investment, we need careful planning to implement services for children. We need the equivalent of the national development plan for children. If there are barriers to providing secure places, such as finding suitably qualified staff, I ask the Minister of State to take further action and obtain the support of the Government to remedy this problem. Nowhere is the need for a co-ordinated approach more urgent than in relation to children. We know many of the reasons many children are vulnerable and we also know many of the consequences if they do not receive help, therapy and appropriate intervention. It is a political imperative that we take decisive action. We must not wait for the next crisis in placement to emerge in this area.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to reply and indicate yet again that the provision of child care places and our policy in relation to children is a priority for the Government and has been since the day we took office in 1997. That is evident from the fact that we have invested more than £90 million extra revenue in the development of our child care services, including new child and family support services, such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects, to allow health boards to provide for a range of appropriate interventions which will place specialised residential care in an appropriate context. This additional funding has allowed the health boards to increase the number of high support and special care places. When this Government took office there were only 17 such places. Unfortunately, from the time of the High Court case in 1995 not one extra place was provided by the previous Government nor was there any planning for such places. Now we have a total of approximately 70 places, which includes one third of the 24 places in the purpose built special care unit at Ballydowd in Dublin, which is ready, but which can only be opened on a phased basis due to the difficulties in recruiting staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of special arrangements have been provided for by health boards for individual children. This will continue to be a feature of the <Col N="179" /> boards' responses to the needs of troubled children. A national development plan exists for the provision of places. The health boards identified the need and plans are under way to provide an additional 56 places nationally. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area the construction of a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane has commenced. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001. The Midland Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board, the North Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus in Castleblayney. Places being provided in the other boards include ten high support places and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board and five high support places for boys in the Southern Health Board. These places are due to become available by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>As mentioned above, special arrangements for individual children will continue to be provided. This will bring the total number of places available to approximately 160 at a total capital cost of approximately £30 million. There were 17 places when the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to a number of points in relation to the speed at which the development of high support and special care can be undertaken and put in place by health boards. Because of the public perception of these services and some opposition from local communities I understand from the health boards that sourcing suitable sites or premises has been difficult. This complicates and lengthens the planning process. The current economic climate makes the recruitment of staff difficult. This has meant that health boards have had to recruit staff from outside the State. Against this background, considerable progress has been made by the health boards in putting this programme of developments in place.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill, currently before a committee of the House, provides for a number of important measures for non-offending children in need of special care or protection. These include Part 3 of the Bill which empowers health boards to apply to the courts for special care orders to detain non-offending children in need of special care or protection and Part 2 which introduces the family welfare conference on a statutory basis for the first time. The family welfare conference has been operating on a pilot basis for the past year. It has been evaluated and given us some valuable guidance and information for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognises that research is needed to establish what works in responding to the needs of children. It is not enough to be well intentioned. Our policies need to be underpinned by solid, research based evidence. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a £200,000 annual research fund has been established under the aegis of the National Children's Office as part of the national children's strategy for research into the needs of children in care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> Child welfare services are not just about additional funding and additional specialised residential services being put in place. They are, more importantly, about ensuring the highest standards in the provision of these services, especially in the provision of services for children in care. Considerable progress has been made since the Government came into office, with the establishment of the social services inspectorate on an administrative basis in April 1999. In the first three years, the inspectorate is concentrating on the child care area and, in particular, on residential child care services. I acknowledge the important work the inspectorate has done to date, in a spirit of partnership with the health board management and staff and other providers of services, in recognising best practice and in helping to improve standards.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter carefully, including concerns about isolated instances where standards of care have fallen short of what is expected, I intend proposing to Government that the social services inspectorate be established on a statutory footing to strengthen its role in ensuring that our child welfare services are of the highest standards. Such a development would also complement the role of the office of the ombudsman for children, which when established will act as a powerful advocate for children and promote the welfare and rights of the child. Along with the ombudsman for children, I intend to continue to be an advocate for children and I know that I have the full backing of the Government in ensuring that will happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone residing in the north-east will know that in recent times the proposal to close the maternity units at Louth county hospital and Monaghan County Hospital has been a live political topic. Naturally, my priority is the maternity unit at Louth county hospital. To close that unit in Dundalk is an unthinkable move. We are talking about the largest provincial town in the country which has a significant population growth projection, both in the immediate and long term. A proposal to close the maternity unit is difficult to understand given the broad outlines we have for a spatial strategy for the north-east and for County Louth in particular. The most significant population growth is along the east coast, particularly between the major cities of Dublin and Belfast. Dundalk falls roughly half way between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maternity unit has operated successfully for many years but for some peculiar reason the North Eastern Health Board or Comhairle na nOspidéal are finding it difficult to make the necessary consultant appointments that would <Col N="181" /> ensure that public trust and confidence in the hospital will not alone be maintained but will be enhanced. They operate on the basis that the viable unit size is approximately 1,000 births per annum. I have no doubt that given the population catchment we have in and around Dundalk, we would reach that target in a relatively short period if we have the necessary consultants.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Comhairle na nOspidéal to pull back from the decision that seems to be imminent. It should re-think the position and appoint consultants, even on an interim basis, to allow public trust and confidence in the hospital's maternity unit to be built up, thus ensuring its future viability and sustainability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years I have shared a warm friendship with Deputy Kirk and I thank him for sharing his time with me. On this occasion, however, I must leave that warm friendship aside and indict both him and his party for the appalling decision to close the maternity unit in Dundalk. With a population of 30,000 it is the biggest town in Ireland and is on its way to achieving city status. Dundalk has suffered over the years and, consequently, it has a high rate of social welfare dependants. Many of the girls who have children in the Louth county hospital are single parents. It is absolutely staggering that in this day and age a hospital unit could be closed. The gynaecological unit will also be moved. The Fianna Fáil Party must find a solution to this matter and the Minister for Health and Children will have to intervene. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, who resides in Dundalk and has a strong commitment to the town, must become involved. He will be judged by the people of Dundalk and the County Louth hinterland if he allows the hospital to close.</P>
      <P>If the boot was on the other foot, I would say the same thing to my own party colleagues. To close a hospital when the country is rolling in unprecedented wealth defies logic. This week, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced savings of £214 million from combating social welfare fraud. Surely that would pay for an obstetrician and a paediatrician? Over the years the North Eastern Health Board allowed this to happen. It is closing the hospital by stealth. A 14-bed unit was not ever going to be viable. The number of births in the catchment area for Louth county hospital is roughly 1,300. Because of the lack of confidence in the region, many Dundalk people by-passed the local hospital and went instead to the Lourdes Hospital in Newry.</P>
      <P>A political party that closes a hospital in the biggest town in Ireland will do so at its peril. I am hanging that issue around the neck of the Fianna Fail Party. I thank Deputy Kirk for sharing his time with me. I hope the concerns he undoubtedly has for the Louth General Hospital will be alleviated by the immediate action of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies will know that the provision of maternity services at Louth General Hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board which has statutory responsibility for the provision of health services in its functional area. The board is committed to developing its acute hospital services in line with the needs and requirements of its resident population.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the board adopted a policy framework for the development of its acute hospitals, called North East Hospitals &ndash; The Next Five Years: A Framework For Continuing Development. This emphasised the need for high quality, safe and accessible acute hospital services, utilising all five hospital sites within the board's area. It confirmed the commitment of the board to developing each hospital site within the two hospital groups, the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and the Louth-Meath hospital group.</P>
      <P>The framework document recommended that the maternity services in the region be reviewed. A review group established for that purpose reported in late 2000. Briefly, the report indicated that: consultant led maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk must cease due to concerns about patient safety; a pilot centre for midwife led obstetric services be established in Dundalk; and consultant led delivery units should be located at Drogheda and Cavan.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been advised that the health board decided &ldquo;not to accept in full the recommendations&rdquo; in the review group's report, and that it unanimously approved the establishment of a further review with a broader remit that will reflect on the potential for cross-Border co-operation and the requirements of spatial planning, as anticipated in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The make up and terms of reference of this further review is an item on the agenda for consideration by the board at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Monday next, 26 February 2001. In this regard I should like to correct a statement the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, made during the debate in this House last week on the issue of maternity services in the north east when he stated, on behalf of the Minister, that plans for this further review would be finalised by the board at its meeting scheduled for Thursday, 15 February 2001. The Minister has since learnt that this statement was factually incorrect and he wishes to avail of the opportunity now presented to set the record straight on the matter and to <Col N="183" /> assure the Chair that it was not the intention to mislead the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister is of the firm view that the way forward for maternity services is about putting in place services that comply with safety standards and internationally recognised best practice recommendations. He met the chairman and representatives of the board and emphasised the need to ensure patient and staff safety. He also informed the board that it was imperative that it establishes and finalises a clear view on what services will be provided at each hospital in the region, the new services which need to be developed and the enhancement of existing services, in the light of the £160 million NDP funding that has been notified to the board. The Minister looks forward to receiving the board's proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been advised that the board further considered the question of maternity services on 5 February last. To avoid the suspension of maternity services at Louth and Monaghan county hospitals, the health board mandated the chief executive officer to seek approval, as a matter of urgency, for the appointment of temporary <Col N="184" /> consultant obstetricians to Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath hospitals and, in addition, to seek approval for the immediate appointment of on-site paediatric cover at both hospitals.</P>
    <P>The approval of any such posts is a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal, which is the statutory body&mdash;</P>

In the circumstances and particularly in view of the need for an early decision, my Department had no objection to the submission of this proposal to An Chomhairle for its consideration and notified the board accordingly.</P>
      <P>I understand the board has submitted applications for approval to the additional temporary posts to An Chomhairle and that these applications are on the agenda for consideration by that body at its next meeting which is scheduled for Wednesday, 28 February 2001.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 February 2001.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by environmental groups relating to an alleged lack of information preventing the designation of special areas of conservation. I do not accept that these concerns are valid. I believe that there is sufficient information available to my Department in respect of all relevant habitats and species other than the dolphin to enable an appropriate selection of Natura 2000 sites to be made. My Department is consulting other relevant bodies to ascertain appropriate sites for the dolphin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU habitats directive requires the European Commission to adopt national lists of candidate sites prior to member states designating them. The Irish national list forms part of the Atlantic biogeographical region and I may not designate these sites until the Atlantic region list <Col N="187" /> is so adopted. My understanding from informal contacts with the European Commission is that, in general, it is pleased with the list of 362 sites provided by Ireland. My Department is aware of the proposals submitted by non-governmental conservation organisations which are being evaluated.</P>
    <P>The fact that I have formally transmitted 362 candidate SACs, covering an area in excess of 900,000 hectares, indicates that there is a substantial amount of information relating to habitats and species available to my Department. All this information is available to the general public and non-governmental conservation organisations. My Department proposes to update its website, which will assist public access to this information.</P>

      <P>D'aontaigh an Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas, ag cruinniú i dtaca leis an bhForas Teanga i mBaile Átha Cliath ar 5 Nollaig 2000, leis na moltaí a chuir Foras na Gaeilge faoina bráid maidir le foclóir Béarla-Gaeilge a chur ar fáil. Is foclóir nua-aoiseach, údarásach ar ardchaighdeán de thart ar 50,000 ceannfhocal agus 250,000 abairtí samplacha i bhfoirm chlóite agus i bhfoirm leic<Col N="188" /> treonach atá i gceist a chur ar fáil i gcomhpháirt le comhlachtaí eile. Meastar go gcosnóidh an tionscnamh, a thógfaidh tréimhse cúig bhliain nó mar sin, thart ar £3.1 milliúin i bpraghasanna an lae inniu. Beartaíodh ar thionscadal an fhoclóra Béarla-Gaeilge toisc go bhfuil glactha leis go forleathan gurb é sin an riachtanas foclóireachta Gaeilge is práiní atá ann.</P>
      <P>Maidir le foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla, tuigtear dom ón bhforas go gcuirfear tús le foclóir nua den chineál sin a luaithe a bheidh an foclóir BéarlaGaeilge curtha i gcrích. Ar ndóigh tá gá le cineálacha éagsúla foclóirí Gaeilge a chur ar fáil le freastal ar riachtanais iomadúla an phobail. Beidh Foras na Gaeilge ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an riachtanas sin in am agus i dtráth de réir mar a bheidh acmhainní aige chuige.</P>

      <P>I regret to inform the Deputy that the number of offshore Islands is unknown to the Department, to the Central Statistics Office or to the Ordnance Survey Office. Of course the question encompasses both islands such as Inis Mór, Blaskets, Rock Islands such as Skellig Mór and the Skerd Rocks. As one can imagine, the actual number could be very large. In this regard, I can address the question only on the basis of the number of islands dealt with in my Department.</P>
      <P>While there have been exceptions, in general, only islands satisfying the following criteria can normally be considered for the purposes of assistance from the islands division of the Department: islands lacking a bridge connecting them to the mainland; islands cut off from the mainland daily by the tide; islands which are currently permanently inhabited; and islands which are not in private ownership.</P>
      <P>Since responsibility for the islands was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach in 1997, the islands that have received assistance from the Department are identified in Annex 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where all or part of an uninhabited or inhabited island is designated as a national monument, special area of conservation, special protected area for birds or natural heritage area, that part will be protected for those interests in accordance with the relevant legislation and any <Col N="189" /> proposal for use of those islands will be assessed to ensure the proposed use will not be significantly damaging to those interests. Development matters that are the responsibilities of other Departments and local authorities, for example, foreshore, planning etc., would be dealt with by those authorities.</P>

Having considered the matter further however, I have decided that the establishment of such a committee is not warranted at this time, bearing in mind that decisions made in recent times regarding the granting of courtesy recognition are being reviewed by the Director of the National Library, in his capacity of Chief Herald. In addition, consideration is being given by the director to ways in which control may be excerised over persons offering recognition, effectively for financial consideration.</P>

      <P>The investment by the Irish Film Board in the past five years for which final figures are available, 1995-99, is £21,115,000. Loans provided by the Irish Film Board fall into four distinct categories: development loans, production loans for the production of feature films and television drama schemes for the development of new talent, completion loans and loans for documentaries Production loans for the production of feature films and television drama is the only area where the board has significant potential to recoup. The investment in feature film and television drama for the period in question was £14,850,000, of which £1,270,500 was directly recouped. It is estimated by the Irish Film Board that of investments made in this period, a further £730,000 will be recouped by mid-2001. The anticipated recoupment for investments over the period is, therefore, £2,000,500. It should be noted that the board is a development agency and its investment therefore needs to be seen in broader terms than just the recoupment of loans. I am satisfied the board is operating effectively in carrying out its statutory role as the national development agency for the indigenous film sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1999, the Heritage Council published a report entitled Archaeological Sites at Risk. This report was based on a pilot survey of 2.2% of the land area of the State and found that 29% of the 1400 monuments in the area under research had been destroyed in the 140 years between 1838 and 1978. Related evidence would appear to suggest that as many as 15 monuments were destroyed in one year spanning 1997 and 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously acknowledged that a problem exists, notwithstanding the significant resources devoted to this area. However, I am satisfied that good progress is being made by my Department in protecting our archaeological heritage notwith<Col N="194" /> standing the increased impact on that heritage arising from the upsurge in development work on foot of our unprecedented economic growth. The planning and development process has been geared up with a view to identifying potential impacts on the archaeological heritage at an early stage thus enabling mitigation strategies to be devised. In addition, there are now over 45,000 farmers included in the REP scheme which obliges them to avoid negative impacts on archaeological sites and monuments which may be located on their properties.</P>
    <P>For my own part, and since publication of the Heritage Council report, I have introduced a number of measures aimed at supporting the protection of the archaeological heritage. These include the following: the resolution of the long-standing contractual difficulties in relation to the archaeologists employed on contract in my Department; the authorisation of an additional eight archaeological posts in the archaeological service of my Department; clearance of the backlog of archaeological licence reports and reduction in the period for processing new applications; and agreement on a code of practice with the National Roads Authority on the protection of archaeological sites under its road development programme. The latter will serve as a model for similar codes with other development sectors with whom discussions are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Despite the progress being made, there is more to be done. While protection of the archaeological heritage is underpinned by extensive legislation already in place which gives legal protection to the 120,000 known archaeological sites and monuments throughout the country, I am anxious to ensure that the legislation continues to meet our needs as the archaeological heritage faces up to the pressures of a new millennium. I have, therefore, initiated a review of national monuments legislation and, following an initial public consultation process, my officials are now actively working on a consolidation of all of the built heritage legislation which comes under my remit into one, comprehensive and cohesive law. This, of course, will need to be complimented by better education and public awareness, which I am constantly striving to achieve through various initiatives, including an annual heritage newsletter to all primary schools in the country. I also intend to publish shortly a natural heritage plan which will present an overview of the initiatives already taken and planned to conserve our heritage.</P>
    <P>My Department continues its core activity of identification and validation of archaeological sites and monuments under the Archaeological Survey of Ireland. The information thus collected and disseminated is a vital tool in helping those involved in all aspects of land management to arrive at informed decisions. I am happy to say that Ireland is to the fore internationally in undertaking such a comprehensive survey and half the country has been covered so far in individual publications. I am proposing to step up the <Col N="195" /> rate of progress on the survey with the aim of having all field survey work completed by 2005.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have secured a total of £36 million of Exchequer funding for ACCESS for the period 2001-2004. An initial assessment of the Cobh theatre project application for ACCESS funding has been completed and it has been determined that the project in question has met the broad criteria for eligibility. Accordingly, the application will now undergo a full evaluation along with other eligible applications and, on the basis of this, recommendations on the projects to be supported will be submitted to me for decision.</P>

      <P>The Clonmel Corporation Minute Book 1608-1649 was donated to the National Library of Ireland in 1974 and is the property of the National Library. The book is in very poor condition and requires extensive conservation work to be carried out. The National Library is not in a position to have this work carried out in the short term. However, I understand that the Director of the National Library has already indicated to the town clerk that when the conservation work has been completed, the library would be pleased to present the corporation with a scanned copy, bound as a volume, which would be suitable for research purposes. In advance of that, the National Library has made available a microfilm copy to the corporation so that the contents will be accessible to interested parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>There is no list available of national monuments or other buildings of historical or cultural significance currently undergoing refurbishment or site investigations, but I have set out in the following table a list of the national monuments and historic properties at which it is proposed to undertake major works by my Department or on an agency basis during the course of 2001. I am satisfied that all of the work planned is necessary from either a conservation, protection or presentation point of view and that this work will be carried out in such a way as to protect the integrity and authenticity of the sites in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> In addition to the sites on the following list my Department will also undertake minor conservation/improvement works at sites as the need arises over the course of the year. As this work will be very much on a need basis it is not possible for me predict the location or number of sites involved. In many cases, my Department would have the opportunity to comment on planning applications affecting heritage properties not in my direct care but it is impossible to give a categorical assurance that all works are carried out by others in such a way that they will not in any way damage or otherwise affect a site. I can, however, assure the Deputy that the legislative framework and systems for protecting the built heritage have been greatly improved since the Government took office.</P>

      <P>The preparation of commonage framework plans is a joint operation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and my Department. Completed framework plans for upland commonages in the six designated degraded counties &ndash; Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo &ndash; are expected to be available by April 2001 for incorporation into farm plans. Plans relating to the rest of the country will take some time to complete. However, I anticipate that all will be completed by the end of the year. Implementation of the plans is dependent on receiving approval for my Department's compensation scheme from the EU Commission.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date in implementing EU directives for which her Department has responsibility; the latest position regarding legal action by the EU Commission in regard to implementation of these directives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Habitats Directive requires member states to propose relevant areas for designation as special areas of conservation for the conservation of listed habitats and species, and to maintain their favourable conservation status. It also requires member states to transmit a list of the proposed areas together with full information on each site to the EU Commission, within three years of the date of the notification of the directive. No member state has met that deadline. The directive specifies scientific criteria for the selection of these areas.</P>
      <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations in March 1997, before my taking office. A total of 362 sites, covering over 900,000 hectares have been formally transmitted to the EU Commission. These are fully protected under national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland for a failure to implement the EU Habitats Directive in March 1999. The failure related to the non-transmission of special areas of conservation as required by Article 4(1) of the directive. At that time Ireland had advertised 207 sites but only 48 of these had been formally transmitted. The Irish defence to this case has been submitted to the European Court of Justice and an oral hearing took place in January 2001. As previously stated, my Department had formally transmitted 362 candidate SACs to the EU Commission at that time. The EU Commission indicated at the European Court of Justice pro<Col N="202" /> ceedings that it was very pleased with the list submitted by Ireland which, on an initial examination, was substantially in compliance with the directive.</P>
    <P>The EU Birds Directive requires member states to establish special protection areas for areas hosting internationally important populations of bird species and for bird habitats. A total of 110 SPAs have been established to date covering 220,000 hectares of land. The Department proposes to extend some existing SPAs and designate some new SPAs in 2001.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has also initiated proceedings against Ireland in connection with overgrazing and the decline of the red grouse population in the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex, a special protection area for birds under the EU Birds Directive. Implementation of the rural environment protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the implementation of farm plans prepared by my Department, taking account of the Commonage Framework Plans, will alleviate and recover the situation. I am awaiting approval from the EU Commission for my Department's compensation scheme before implementing these plans.</P>
    <P>I am confident that all these measures will, when fully implemented, redress the problem of overgrazing. In the meantime my Department, in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's Office, has prepared a robust defence of the case.</P>

      <P>The implementation of recommendations of the Film Industry Review Group is already well under way.</P>
      <P>The section 481 tax incentive scheme has been extended for an unprecedented five-year period up to April 2005.</P>
      <P>The Film Board's budgetary allocation has been almost doubled from £4,777,000 in 1998 to £8,700,000 in 2001. Plans for the reorganisation and strengthening of the board's management and staffing structures under the newly appointed board are under active consideration. I expect that the board will be developing a more business-focused thrust in its operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> In accordance with the recommendations of the review group, the board's priorities will be to address the following issues: development of high-quality, market-focused scripts; strategic business development support for companies; marketing of Irish films and of Ireland as a centre of excellence for film production; supporting Screen Training Ireland in meeting the strategic skills and creative needs of the sector; production support and advice; technological foresight. I recently announced the following appointments to the board for a four-year term: Mr. O. J.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority's Road Accident Facts Report for 1999 showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for motorists, including young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal.</P>
      <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board and this issue, among others, will be addressed in a report which is expected by the end of the year. Upon receipt of this report, and taking all other initiatives into consideration, I will then decide as to what further action is appropriate to reduce the cost of motor insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the legislation governing the safe use of chemicals which is enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, a statutory body under the auspices of my Department, are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific legislation covers the classification, packaging and labelling of chemicals which came onto the EU market for the first time after 18 September 1981. Such chemicals must be notified in the member state of manufacture or in the member state which first imports the chemical <Col N="206" /> onto the European market. This process of notification is laid down in accordance with the requirements of a series of European Council directives implemented into Irish law by a number of separate Statutory Instruments which are listed in this reply. These regulations contain various annexes which outline the risk and safety phrases, the criteria for classifying for a particular hazard to man and/or the environment, and specify the test criteria to be used when assessing such chemicals for hazards.</P>
    <P>Such a notification scheme is not in place for general industrial chemicals placed on the EU market before 18 September 1981. In order to address this situation Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93 on the Evaluation and Control of the Risks of Existing Substances was introduced and came into force in all member states on 23 March 1993. The concept behind this regulation was to identify the most hazardous chemicals, which are produced in high volumes and have a wide/dispersive use. As there are so many pre-September 1981 chemicals on the market, it was necessary to prioritise these chemicals so that those of concern could undergo in-depth assessment. The risk assessment identifies any data gaps, requirements to perform tests, and assesses the risk from exposure to these chemicals. Tests must be performed in accordance with the same test method criteria laid down in respect of substances placed on the market after September 1981. The risk assessment may also conclude that risk management measures are required.</P>
    <P>Whether a chemical is pre- or post-September 1981, the supplier is obliged to provide information in the form of a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each chemical classified as dangerous. This is currently the situation for dangerous preparations also.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the competent authority for post September 1981 substances and, while not formally designated, functions as the competent authority for chemicals placed on the market before September 1981.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority also services and enforces regulations on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations. These regulations allow for the restriction or limitation of use of dangerous chemicals regarding specific processes, applications, or a total ban, dependent on the identified hazards and potential adverse effects should exposure occur.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, there is an obligation on employers to protect their workers and so provide the necessary information to protect their safety and health. This obligation would include information on any hazardous chemical at the workplace, including information on control measures required to protect against exposure.</P>
    <P>On 13 February 2001, the European Commission adopted a White Paper setting out a strategy for a future Community policy for chemicals. The main objective of the new chemical strategy <Col N="207" /> is to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment, while ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the chemical industry.</P>
    <P>The regulations enforced in this area by the Health and Safety Authority are as follows: European Communities (Dangerous Substances) (Classification Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 1979 (S.I. No. 383 of 1979); European Communities (Classification, Packaging, Labelling and Notification of Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 393 of 2000); European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Dangerous Preparations) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 393 of 1992); European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Dangerous Preparations) Regulations, 1995 (S.I. No. 272 of 1995); European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 107 of 2000); Council Regulation (EC) No. 793/93 on the Evaluation and Control of the Risks of Existing Substances; Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and regulations made thereunder.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that certain substances are exempt from the above legislation as they are covered by other similar legislation which comes under the remit of Departments or bodies other than the Health and Safety Authority. The exemptions are specified, as appropriate, in the above regulations. The Health and Safety Authority may be contacted at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin, 2.</P>

      <P>The Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, which I was pleased to put through the Oireachtas and which was commenced on and from 1 January 2001, makes comprehensive provision for the first time in Irish law for performers' rights in respect of the exploitation of their performances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the rights afforded to performers under the Act is the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the broadcasting live, or including live in a cable programme service, of the whole or any substantial part of a performance protected under the Act. The Act also gives performers the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making of a recording of a whole or any substantial <Col N="208" /> part of the protected performance directly from a broadcast of, or cable programme including, the live performance. These rights, and complementary rights provided for the holders of copyrights and recording rights in relation to musical works, song lyrics and sound recordings, provide a stable legal environment in which the economic interests of all musical creators, including performers, are protected in the broadcasting environment. The Act also provides effective civil remedies in the event of these rights being infringed and criminal penalties ranging up to a maximum of a fine of £100,000 or five years' imprisonment, or both, may apply where an offence in breach of such rights is proved.</P>
    <P>In providing Ireland with copyright legislation with state of the art intellectual property protection for the information age, the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, has given effect in Irish law to all the requirements of current EU and international law in the field of copyright and related rights.</P>

      <P>My Department has a policy in place in relation to the use of e-mail and Internet facilities. The policy was last updated in October 1999 and was communicated to all staff. This policy states that the e-mail and Internet facilities are provided to assist staff in carrying out the business of the Department. It indicates that the Department reserves the right to monitor and control messages sent <i>via </i>e-mail. It requires staff to ensure that messages are courteous, professional and businesslike. The policy indicates that it constitutes a violation of the code to, <i>inter alia</i>, send e-mail messages containing offensive, disparaging or harassing messages.</P>
      <P>In light of developments such as those referred to in the newspaper article quoted by the Deputy, my Department recently undertook a review of the policy in relation to e-mail and Internet facilities. The revised policy, which will include a reference to voicemail facilities, will issue to all staff shortly.</P>
      <P>The use of e-mail and Internet facilities is continuously monitored in my Department. The Department also keeps abreast of developments in technology designed to prevent abuse of the e-mail and Internet facilities. My Department is currently upgrading its security systems in this regard and is in the process of selecting new software to monitor and control all electronic communications into and out of the Department by e-mail or the Internet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the total area afforested during the period 1996 to 1999 was 58,000 hectares, on more than 143,000 acres. While this represents a substantial level of afforestation, it is nevertheless significantly below the target set for this period in the 1996 strategic plan. The strategic plan set the target for annual broadleaf afforestation at 20% of total annual afforestation. Broadleaf planting during the period 1996 to 1999 amounted to 11,400 hectares, including planting of commercial broadleaves and broadleaves for environmental considerations. Thus the target for broadleaf planting of 20% of total annual afforestation is being met.</P>
      <P>To address the shortfall in planting levels, substantial increases in afforestation grant and premium rates were implemented last year. It remains to be seen the extent to which these increases will lead to any acceleration in the planting programme.</P>
      <P>Apart from this major review last year of the premium levels, we have also had the strategic review of Coillte Teo. In addition, the timber industry development group, which includes representatives of key stakeholders, is considering a number of the major issues relating to the sector. It is expected that the report of the group will be available later this year.</P>
      <P>Other significant recent developments of relevance to the forestry sector include the publication of the code of best forest practice, national forest standard and environmental guidelines, the rural development plan and the national climate change strategy. A review of the Forestry Act is also under way. It will be seen, therefore, that most of the elements of strategic forestry policy are being tackled on an ongoing basis. When the present cycle of reviews and work in progress is completed, it will be for consideration if a wider review of the strategic plan as a totality should be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the compounded impact of the earthquakes of 13 January and 13 February on the population of El Salvador. These have directly affected more than one million people. According to reports from the national emergency committee, the latest figures from the second earthquake show 283 people dead and 2,937 injured. The official death toll from the first earthquake, according to Red Cross figures, is 827 but this number may still increase as many people remain missing.</P>
      <P>As detailed in my previous reply to questions on 30 January, the Irish Government was quick to respond to the international appeal for assistance made by the President of El Salvador in the days following the earthquake. On Monday, 15 January, an initial allocation of £200,000 was made to the International Federation of the Red Cross which had activated its emergency plan as soon as the earthquake happened. A further £300,000 was granted to the Irish non-governmental organisations Trócaire, Concern and GOAL, who quickly mobilised resources and personnel in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. The Irish Government's support for these programmes will help approximately 10,000 families to recover from the impact of this disaster and represents a total Ireland Aid response to the first earthquake in El Salvador of £500,000.</P>
      <P>Since the second earthquake, further proposals for funding have been received from NGOs working in the affected area. These proposals are currently being given sympathetic consideration by Ireland Aid under the established criteria for emergency funding and further Ireland Aid support is anticipated. Together with our EU partners, we have to date provided over 21 million euro in bilateral aid to the relief effort in El Salvador.</P>

      <P>Ireland, with our EU partners, supports the fact finding commission of inquiry agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, led by Senator George Mitchell, and on which EU high representative, Javier Solana, represents the European Union. We see the commission as a significant confidence building measure agreed by both sides. It is, therefore, a matter of great concern that in the lead up to the Israeli election the fact finding commission was postponed and Israeli co-operation with the technical staff on the ground ceased. We urge the Israeli Government to fully re-engage with the work of the commission. This will be an important measure to help rebuild the confidence and trust which are essential to the success of every peace process.</P>

      <P>The use of the Internet and e-mail is under ongoing review, in particular in relation to the security measures necessary to protect both the Department's IT network and its staff. Guidelines are in place for the use of the IT system by staff. Messages have been circulated to all staff outlining the parameters for appropriate use of the IT system which is deemed to be for official use. Inappropriate use of official resources is a disciplinary matter. These guidelines are supported by the deployment of software to minimise the potential receipt of inappropriate material.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently finalising a formal policy on the use of the computer network, including e-mail and access to the Internet. The proposed policy has been the subject of internal discussions, most recently with the partnership committee. It is intended that this policy will be introduced on a pilot basis with effect on 1 March 2001.</P>

      <P>My priorities for public transport policy in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and towns such as Tralee, are set down in the regional public transport programme of the national development plan, which provides for investment of £650 million in regional public transport. For towns and cities, the programme has the following elements: bus and rail development in the greater Cork area; bus development in Limerick, Galway and Waterford; regional bus improvements; accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities; Bus Éireann ongoing fleet replacement and re-equipment; pilot measures for rural public transport to encourage local or community based initiatives to provide bus services in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these investments is to tackle increased congestion and to improve the quality of public transport at the local level. Last year alone, 60 new buses, all of them low floor and wheelchair accessible, were purchased by Bus Éireann for these cities. A private operator who is licensed by my Department is currently providing public transport services in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the strategic level, the local authorities in both Cork and Limerick have commissioned planning, land use and transportation studies, which are currently under way. My Department is participating in these studies through its representation on the advisory group of the Cork study and the steering group of the Limerick study. As to Waterford, I understand the corporation has recently retained consultants to undertake a land use study and my Department will <Col N="214" /> be involved in the study process. A land use and transportation study is also under way in Tralee and CIE is represented on its steering group.</P>

      <P>The ESB has been operating a 40 MW peat fired power station at Bellacorrick since 1962. This plant was scheduled for closure in 2004. The tripartite agreement which was signed in February 2000 between my Department, ESB management and the ESB group of unions, provides for the phased closure of all existing peat fired power stations, including Bellacorrick, to be dovetailed with the coming on stream of two new ESB peat fired power stations at Lanesboro and Shannonbridge. The ESB is steadily on course with design, planning and preparations for the construction of the two new plants by 2004 and closure of Bellacorrick will proceed, as scheduled within this framework.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £812,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utilities costs such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £136,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the barracks. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be crucial in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig.</P>
    <P>My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of last year for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork County development plan. Discussions have been ongoing between Cork County Council and my Department to determine the best way forward to realise the potential of the integrated plan, while taking account of the aspirations of all sides. The most recent meeting took place on 19 February 2001, following a request from the county council, and involved officials of my Department and the local authority. It is hoped to bring the matter to conclusion at an early date.</P>
    <P>I recently received a request for a meeting from the county council and I will consider the matter favourably in light of the outcome of the discussions at official level.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works acts as agent for the Directorate for Asylum Support Services of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in sourcing suitable accommodation for asylum seekers. Decisions relating to such proposals are a matter for the directorate in the final instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a nationwide search for asylum seeker accommodation, negotiation, on behalf of the directorate, took place through last year with the proprietors of Haversham House in Rochestown, Cork. In light of the developing accommodation requirements of the directorate, negotiations were discontinued subsequently in <Col N="219" /> relation to the property. Accordingly, no asylum seekers were accommodated at this location.</P>
    <P>Some £42,000 was expended on the property in respect of preparatory works. This outlay has been recouped in full to the State. As my Office was engaged in preparatory works on the property and it was the intention to utilise the property for the accommodation of asylum seekers, it was deemed necessary to provide security for the premises and this amounted to <i>circa </i>£58,000.</P>

      <P>In December 1999 the Government decided that the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, would be extended to a range of bodies in the enterprise sector with effect from 21 January 2001. Regulations to give effect to this decision are at an advanced stage of preparation and will be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas this week. Before the regulations can come into effect, motions approving of them in draft must be passed by both Houses. The process, which usually involves a referral to a joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, is expected to take two to three weeks.</P>
      <P>Owing to the Christmas recess and to discussions on technical issues with the various bodies concerned and with the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman, it was not possible to have the necessary motions approved in the Dáil and Seanad this year in advance of 21 January 2001.

      <P>Monitoring of the growth of private sector credit in Ireland and prudential supervision of credit institutions in general is a matter for the Central Bank. The Central Bank as part of its monitoring and prudential supervision is cognisant of the risks posed by rapid credit growth in general and has been active in alerting banks to these risks. In this regard, the Governor of the Central Bank has written to the lending institutions on several <Col N="220" /> occasions reiterating the need for prudence in lending practices.</P>
      <P>As regards credit card debt, the level of outstanding indebtedness is about 1% of overall outstanding private sector credit. The rate of growth in credit card indebtedness last October was broadly in line with the rate of growth in total private sector credit at that time. I am aware that many customers clear their accounts on a monthly basis. For those who do not clear them, the interest costs are high and customers should consider more cost effective alternatives.</P>

      <P>A person who is normally resident in the State is not eligible for temporary exemption from the registration requirement and, accordingly, may only use in the State a motor car which has been registered in the State. This applies whether the motor car in question is owned by the person concerned or is a company car. The only exception to this requirement is in the case of a foreign registered commercial company vehicle which may be used in the State by a State resident for business use on behalf of an employer established outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans to review or alter the rules set out above which are, I am informed, applied generally throughout the European Union. As the Deputy is aware, vehicle registration tax, VRT, is charged at the time of registration of a vehicle in the State and is an important and valuable source <Col N="221" /> of revenue to the Exchequer. It is necessary to apply the registration rules fairly and consistently to all State residents and it would be inappropriate to differentiate in favour of persons who reside in the State but happen to work in Northern Ireland. Apart from the administration and policing costs involved in the collection of VRT, the use of foreign registered motor cars in the State by persons who are clearly State residents would lead to complaints from other residents and would seriously undermine Revenue's ongoing efforts to prevent the illegal use of foreign registered vehicles in the State, particularly in Border areas. I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a number of decisions to refuse temporary exemption from the registration requirement in such situations have been appealed to the Appeal Commissioners and in each case Revenue's decision to refuse temporary exemption has been upheld.</P>

      <P>The changeover to the euro involves preparation of legislation, production of euro cash, preparations by the public sector and by businesses, consumer matters and the provision of widescale public information. Substantial progress has been made to date under each of these headings and further extensive preparations are in hand. Evidence of the scale of these preparations is the fact that the Estimate for my Department this year provides for £14.678 million towards the work of the Euro Changeover Board. The total expenditure of the board last year was £1.8 million.</P>
      <P>Much legislation dealing with the euro has already been put in place at EU and national level. More recently, the Euro Changeover (Amounts) Bill, 2001, which I published on 5 February 2001, provides for the substitution, with effect from 1 January 2002, of convenient euro amounts for Irish pound amounts at specific references in listed Acts and Statutory Instruments. Together with the Finance Bill, 2001, and the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, and other forthcoming legislation, it will provide a framework of convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002 in the principal areas of law under which citizens regularly transact business with the State. In all cases of changes to convenient amounts in this legislation, the principle of favouring the citizen will be followed. Irish pound amounts in law that are not affected by this national legislation will be converted to euro on 1 January 2002 at the conversion rate under Council Regulation (EC) No. 974/98.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> Production of euro banknotes and coins by the Central Bank is on target, while Departments confirm that progress on preparations by the public sector is satisfactory. These preparations will continue to be monitored by my Department. Consumer matters are for my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has responsibility for consumer affairs, and for the Director of Consumer Affairs. The National Code of Practice on the Euro Changeover was re-launched by them last December, along with an action plan for consumer protection during the changeover.</P>
    <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, has carried out extensive public information activities since its establishment in 1998. These have included a leaflet to every household in 1998, 1999 and 2000, widespread circulation of posters and leaflets, provision of a local inquiry line &ndash; 1890 20 1050 &ndash; and website &ndash; www.euro.ie &ndash; and distribution of information packs to schools and of guidelines to every teacher. A national television, radio and press campaign commenced in early January. A train the trainers pack is being made widely available for general use. The needs of low awareness groups are being addressed through the board's consultative panel and many of the projects in the board's programme of part-funding for non-governmental organisations carrying out euro information activities relate to these groups.</P>
    <P>The Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign has provided extensive information to help businesses to prepare themselves for the changeover. Earlier this month Forfás began fresh radio advertising aimed specifically at business. Measures on the lines of the above will be continued and intensified as the year progresses. In particular, the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign is intensifying its campaign to stimulate increased preparation by businesses, while the ECBI will be intensifying the provision of advertising and information aimed at the public. Specific initiatives will include the launch shortly by the ECBI of a retail tool, in the form of a computer disk, to help retailers calculate their cash requirements for the first week of 2002, the launch before the end of March of a further round of funding under the ECBI's NGO programme and the provision by the ECBI of a booklet for all households in autumn 2001.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the printing of C2s is being carried out within the parameters agreed with the printers.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the application for a C2 certificate by the taxpayer referred to by the Deputy was received in the Office of the Inspector of Taxes, Wexford, on 12 January 2001. The approved application was forwarded to the printers on 7 February 2001, that is, the approval of the application and transmission of the details for production of the C2 to the printers took 19 working days. The delay in processing the application, which was due to an oversight, is regretted. The C2 was received back in the tax office on 19 February 2001 and the taxpayer called to the tax office on the same day to collect it. In this case, the C2 card was received back from the printers within nine working days.</P>

      <P>The board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has in recent years achieved a significant re-organisation and redevelopment of its activities. I have acknowledged publicly these achievements which involved considerable input and support from staff throughout the service. This substantial programme of change has been developed and overseen by a dedicated and committed board. Members of the board give of their time and expertise on a voluntary basis and have important and busy medical and professional careers. Membership is demanding, time consuming and reflects a genuine and practical commitment to an essential public service. I consider that the call made by clinicians for the resignation of board members is unfair to board members. The statement does nothing to build confidence in the organisation among its staff, its donors or the general public. I have expressed my concern about the breakdown in the relationships between clinicians in Munster and the board. The maintenance of public confidence in the blood service requires a healthy and harmonious <Col N="225" /> relationship between all clinicians and the IBTS. This is why in my view the statement should be withdrawn and the clinicians concerned should pursue the issues through correct procedures of effective dialogue and partnership. I am prepared to meet representatives of the clinicians concerned to progress this issue.</P>

      <P>The magazine article referred to by the Deputy suggests that smog, and particularly the ozone constituent of smog, damages the lungs of infants and may cause asthma. Exposure of very small children or indeed persons generally to smog is detrimental to the respiratory system. Smog associated with residential coal burning, which was a feature of Dublin and other urban areas, has been largely eliminated due to effective smoke control measures. Other emissions, particularly from road traffic, now pose the greatest threat to air quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that air quality is assessed in relation to national and EU standards for a variety of pollutants, including ozone, by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Concentrations of ozone are currently monitored at a number of locations in compliance with an EU Directive on air pollution and the levels recorded are normally very low. The directive establishes thresholds for ozone above which <Col N="228" /> there may be effects on human health. These thresholds are consistent with guidelines recommended by the World Health Organisation. The EPA has drawn up a national air quality monitoring programme which places greater emphasis on data dissemination and the need to keep the public fully informed.</P>

With regard to non-medical card holders, incontinence products which are genuine incontinence products and which are not advertised to the public are reimbursable under the drugs payment scheme.</P>
      <P>Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible and the role played by home helps is vital to the success of this policy. Following the publication of the report entitled &ldquo;The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland&rdquo; by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I made available a total of £2.280 million to the health boards between 1999 and 2000 to expand and develop the home help service and provide appropriate training for home helps as recommended in the report. I am pleased to inform the House that a further £2 million has been allocated in 2001 to provide home help services to more people and/or more hours for existing clients.</P>
      <P>In the 2001 budget, an additional £12 million, rising to £24 million in the year 2002, was announced for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. It was decided that, of this, £5 million, rising to £10 million in the year 2002, would be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million, with a full year cost of £6 million, for personal assistance services. This means that over the next two years, funding is being provided for an additional 312 personal assistants to provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million ongoing funding is being made available for the home support services, including personal assistance services.</P>

      <Quest>the recommendations made by the expert medical group which reported in 1982 on adverse reactions to the three-in-one vaccine (details supplied); the number of recommendations which have been implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to concerns about an alleged link between the whooping cough component of the three-in-one vaccine and the occurrence of brain damage in children, an Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination was established in 1977 by the then Minister for Health &ldquo;to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The group was completely independent of the Department of Health in its operation and in the conclusions it reached. At the outset, it recognised that it would be impossible to prove conclusively in any case a cause and effect relationship between the vaccination and the person's disability. This finding is consistent with later international research undertaken on this issue.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the group came to its conclusions on the balance of probability in individual cases. Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of the doubt to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The group found that in 16 of the 93 cases it examined, there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage. An <i>ex gratia</i> payment was offered in each of these 16 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extensive international research has been conducted over many years regarding the possible link between the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine and chronic brain damage. It was known that in common with all other vaccines and therapeutic substances, adverse reactions to DTP occurred. Nevertheless it was considered in this country as in all other countries using the vaccine, that the benefits to children far outweighed the potential risks and helped protect them from the serious consequences of previously prevalent diseases. The identification and use of contraindications to the vaccine helped further to reduce any potential risk. In those children in whom <Col N="230" /> DTP was contraindicated, it was recommended that they be given DT, that is, Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccination without the pertussis component.</P>
    <P>The consensus of the international literature on this subject is best encapsulated in the following quotation from Paediatrics Vol. 97 No. 2. February 1996:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Academy* reaffirms its earlier conclusions that whole cell pertussis vaccine has not been proven to be a cause of brain damage and continues to recommend pertussis vaccination in accordance with the guidelines in the 1994 &lsquo;Red Book'&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>*American Academy of Paediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases</P>
    <P>This view is confirmed in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland of the Royal College of Physicians which were published in 1996. The report advises &ldquo;although there has been controversy about pertussis vaccine the consensus from authoritative bodies is that it is a safe vaccine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination did not make recommendations other than the findings in each individual case examined.</P>

      <P>The Government's Integrated Strategy on Homelessness outlines a new approach to the way in which services for the homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. As part of the strategy, local authorities have established homeless fora, where they were not already in place, and are in the process of developing three-year action plans, jointly with the health boards and voluntary bodies. These action plans will set out clear aims and actions on how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved.</P>
      <P>The action plan for the Dublin area has been completed and adopted by Dublin Corporation's Housing SPC and will be considered by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin county councils Housing SPCs before the end of this month. The plan sets out a strategic framework for tackling homelessness in Dublin in a thorough and effective manner. A new Homeless Services Agency has been established and it will oversee the delivery of services to homeless persons, by statutory and voluntary agencies in the Dublin area, in a coherent and integrated manner.</P>
      <P>The Government has made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented. Capital spending by local authorities on accommodation for the homeless is to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the five years, 2001-06. An extra £6 million per annum in current funding will be available from my Department to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and to establish settlement and outreach services. Additional funding will also be available from health boards to fund care and welfare requirements. Voluntary bodies will also continue to be assisted to provide additional accommodation for homeless persons under the voluntary housing schemes operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the EPA (Amendment) Bill will be to amend the integrated pollution control licensing provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 and the waste licensing provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996. These amendments are necessary to give full effect in national law to EU directive 96/61/EC on integrated pollution prevention and control.</P>
      <P>The principal amendments will be to change the technical basis of the licensing systems from BATNEEC &ndash; best available technology not entailing excessive costs &ndash; to BAT &ndash; best available techniques, to give more formal recognition to emission limit values as the operational basis of integrated pollution control licensing and waste licensing by EPA; to make additional provision for the impact of transboundary emissions to be considered and addressed in individual cases; to provide for the adoption and application of general binding rules to replace individual licence conditions for certain categories of licensable activity; and to provide for the EPA in determining licences to have regard to national or sectoral ceilings for emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The integrated pollution control and waste licensing regimes administered by EPA under the 1992 and 1996 Acts are well-established and substantially in line with the provisions of the IPPC directive. The amendments outlined above are technical refinements to the legislative basis of both regimes in order to bring them fully into line with the directive. The Bill will also make a number of amendments to strengthen the Litter Pollution Act, 1997. The general scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government. The Government's legislative programme provides for its publication mid-2001.</P>

      <P>Implementation of access to information on the environment regulations from 1993 and of freedom of information legislation from 1998, together with enhanced state of the environment and other reporting by EPA since its establishment, have all served to increase the overall level of transparency and accountability in local authority operations.</P>
      <P>As part of the programme for local government renewal, local authorities are increasingly conducting their business on a partnership basis with the aim,<i> inter alia,</i> of achieving greater transparency and accountability. For example, community and sectoral interests are represented on strategic policy committees and participate in the development and monitoring of local authority policies, including policies related to environmental protection. Moreover, local authorities are at present preparing corporate plans in the framework of the strategic management initiative which are due to be published in March 2001 and customer action plans incorporating service indicators are being developed. These initiatives also will enhance local authority accountability across the range of services provided locally.</P>
      <P>As far as the environment is concerned, the EPA has a statutory function to oversee the performance by local authorities of their responsibilities in relation to its protection. In this context, the agency is developing a management system which will assess the performance of local authorities; a pilot phase is currently in operation and the agency expects the system to be introduced to all local authorities by 2002. This structured assessment by the agency will significantly strengthen the accountability of local authorities for their performance in the area of environmental protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency report, Ireland's Environment: a Millennium Report, confirms that by international standards, Irish waters are in good condition. The report however, identifies eutrophication, or over-enrichment of waters, mainly by phosphorus, as perhaps Ireland's most serious environmental pollution problem. Agriculture has been identified as the single biggest contributor in this regard accounting for 73% of total phosphorus inputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1997 my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, catchment-based strategy to <Col N="238" /> tackle all sources of eutrophication. Major catchment-based projects for the establishment of water quality monitoring and management systems are well under way. The strategy is already beginning to show evidence of some improvements in water quality. In some instances, like Nenagh and Athlone where phosphorus reduction has been incorporated in sewage treatment, measurements have shown a significant reduction of phosphorus concentrations in the receiving waters.</P>
    <P>The recently published EPA report, River Shannon: Lake Water Quality Monitoring 1998 &amp; 1999, indicates a reduction in the symptoms of eutrophication in Loughs Key, Ree and Derg, due in part to the impact of zebra mussels. To address the problem of eutrophication by phosphorus and to give effect to EU Directive 76/464/EEC (Dangerous Substances), in 1998 I made the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998 which set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by the end of 2007.</P>
    <P>In addition, a voluntary agreement with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association (IDAPA) now provides for an incremental move, to be completed by the end of 2002, to zero phosphate domestic laundry detergents by IDAPA members. I have recently enacted the Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2001 (S.I. No.12 of 2001) which give further effect to EU Directive 76/464/EEC and support implementation of the recently adopted water framework directive (2000/60/EC).</P>
    <P>As part of the implementation of the newly adopted Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) my Department is now extending its catchment-based strategy by promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution.</P>
    <P>Agricultural sources will continue to be tackled also by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development through substantially funded schemes, including the rural environment protection scheme and the scheme for management of farmyard waste, as well as through the promotion of nutrient management planning. Agricultural sources are also being addressed by way of by-laws made by local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of waters as required by the Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) was carried out in 1992/93 and again in 1997/98. Based on the later monitoring, I announced in July 2000 that certain groundwaters, in five counties (Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford) are susceptible to pollution by nitrates. Work is now proceeding towards the identification of the relevant catchments, which will be designated as nitrate vulnerable zones, where special measures will be taken to protect water quality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The National Development Plan, 2000-2006 provides for capital investment of £3 billion in water services. The major portion of this expenditure will be directed to investment in the provision and upgrading of waste water treatment facilities. The investment will largely complete Ireland's implementation of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, which is one of the most important pieces of EU legislation for environmental protection. The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) is fully transposed by way of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Urban Waste Water Treatment) Regulations, 1994.</P>
    <P>Directive 80/778/EEC was implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 81 of 1988). Amending regulations were made in 1999 and 2000 (S.I. No. 350 of 1999 and S.I. No. 177 of 2000) to tighten up certain aspects of the regulations. The EU Commission has, however, initiated proceedings in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) alleging non-compliance by Ireland with the requirements of the directive, mainly in relation to water quality deficiencies in private, rural group water schemes. Record investment of £420 million provided under the rural water programme is being targeted at remedying deficiencies in these schemes. A vigorous defence of the ECJ proceedings has been lodged.</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 439 of 2000) were made in December 2000 and will come into operation on 1 January 2004. These regulations transpose EU Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption. Specific standards and other requirements for water quality have been set in statutory instruments transposing other EU directives for a range of water uses, notably in respect of groundwater, bathing waters, surface waters for the abstraction of drinking water, waters supporting salmonid and cyprinid fish, and shellfish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recently published Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report, 1999 shows that Ireland's air quality is generally good. All limit values for ambient levels of air pollutants in EU directives were complied with, apart from the 98 percentile of mean hourly values for the calendar year for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at College Green, Dublin (211 g/m3 compared with the limit value of 200 <Col N="240" /> g/m3), reflecting the heavy impact of city traffic at this site.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that new EU limit values for particulate matter (to be met from 2005) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (to be met from 2010) will be challenging to meet, particularly in urban areas with heavy traffic. Recent measures designed to improve air quality include the extension of the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal to five additional urban areas (October 2000), the introduction of new fuel standards for petrol and diesel (January and March 2000), improved emission standards for new vehicles (January 2001), the introduction of the national car test (January 2000), the promotion of European car free day (September 2000) and significant investment in transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I also recently enforced regulations setting a statutory limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil for the first time, and further strengthening controls on the sulphur content of gas oil which will significantly reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) from 1 January 2003. The national climate change strategy also contains a number of cross-cutting measures which will further facilitate a reduction in SO2 and NOx emissions. Further measures to reduce emissions of SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, and ammonia will be included in a national emissions reduction strategy which my Department is currently developing.</P>
      <P>Other measures to be introduced this year include the mandatory display of information on the fuel economy and CO2 emissions of new passenger cars, and regulations limiting the emissions of volatile organic compounds from the use of organic solvents. Any additional measures that may be required to comply with new EU air quality standards over time will be considered in the light of the EPA's preliminary assessment of national air quality. It is expected that this assessment will be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>Under the social welfare system, homeless persons have the same entitlements as any other Irish citizen. If they are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work, then they can apply for unemployment assistance. They can be paid basic supplementary welfare allowance if they do not fulfil the conditions for any other primary weekly payment from my Department. In addition, they can also apply for payments such as rent supplementation, diet supplement and exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation. Some £2 million was provided for rent deposits in 2000. The main policy initiative taken recently in relation to homelessness was the establishment of a cross departmental team on the issue, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The team also included representatives of my Department and the Departments of Education and Science, Finance, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Its report was published last year by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal and the main recommendations have been accepted by the Government. As a result, action plans for the delivery of services to homeless people are being drawn up by local authorities and health boards. Additional funding has been provided and a homeless forum is being established in each county, bringing together the statutory and voluntary agencies responding to the needs of homeless people.</P>
      <P>The Dublin action plan on homelessness was recently agreed and provides for the establishment of the Dublin Homeless Services Agency to co-ordinate and manage an integrated approach to the delivery of services to homeless people. My officials have been in contact with the agency with a view to ensuring that my Department contributes to improving the position of homeless people where possible.

      <P>Persons aged under 21 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65 years of age the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>The contribution conditions for treatment benefit, which are set down in regulations, are in line with those applying to other social insurance benefit schemes. These conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme while directing limited resources towards those in greatest need. They also ensure a realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record.</P>

This means that, for instance, where one parent has care of a child for most of the week that parent may, subject to the other qualifying conditions, receive payment of the one-parent family payment. In cases where both parents claim joint equal custody, neither can be considered to have main care and charge of the child and so a one-parent family payment cannot be paid.</P>
      <P>The review of the one-parent family payment, published in September 2000, examined the issues surrounding joint custody agreements and the social welfare system. It considered a range of measures to afford these arrangements some recognition within the system. However, it was unable to suggest a solution which did not compromise the basis of the one-parent family payment, erode the effectiveness of payments such as child benefit or create other anomalies within the system. Accordingly, there are no plans at present to introduce arrangements along the lines suggested by the Deputy. However, in the circumstances outlined it may be possible for both parents to receive income tax relief through the lone parent's tax allowance. Details are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The Department has a business information protection policy aimed at ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data supported on its computer systems and compliance with national and European legislative requirements in this regard. This policy provides clear direction for all staff in observing security requirements and includes a comprehensive set of baseline security recommendations. All facilities, including e-mail and the internet, are provided only to staff who need them to carry out their day-to-day duties.</P>
      <P>Local management is obliged to familiarise all personnel with the business information protection policy. Individual employees must ensure that they use information and equipment in accordance with the appropriate standards and procedures. A copy of the policy statement is held by all managers. A compliance reminder is displayed on the monitor screen each time a person logs on to the Department's computer systems.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> The Department's business information protection committee regularly reviews policy to ensure it is in line with the latest industry standards. Any resulting revisions and/or further standards required are issued as appropriate. The most recent update to the policy was in January 2001 and staff were notified. The Department is a member of the Information Security Forum from which it receives material and other advice regarding information security developments.</P>

      <P>Efforts have been ongoing for years to increase the availability of our broadcasting services in the North by upping power northwards from RTE transmitters in Clermont Carn in County Louth. After much discussion and negotiation between Irish and British officials, late last year, the power of the transmitters was increased to a stage where RTE estimate that access to television services originating on this side of the Border had increased to at least 70% of the population of Northern Ireland. There was approximately 30% level when the current efforts to secure increased coverage began. I am advised that further work at the transmitters at Clermont Carn is unlikely to lead to further significant improvement in reception in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that each year my Department receives a number of requests from local authorities or local communities regarding the floodlighting of a national monument in their area. While there is little doubt that floodlighting can often enhance and give dramatic impact to certain monuments and buildings, there are issues of concern that need to be carefully looked at in relation to any floodlighting proposal. These issues include possible disturbance of the archaeology of the site; the layout of the cabling required for the project; ongoing maintenance and running cost of the scheme; the type and location of the fixtures and fittings used; minimising light pollution by the use of timer devices; the safety and security of the site; and conservation of fauna, for example, impacts on endangered bat population. My officials are at present considering all these issues with a view to developing a set of formal guidelines-criteria which will be applied to any future floodlighting requests. I expect work on this matter to be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Given the range of pressures in relation to conservation works at the 750 sites in my care, floodlighting would not take priority in drawing up work programmes. Nevertheless, the question of possible floodlighting at Tagahdoe Church and Roundtower, Maynooth, will be considered in the context of the new guidelines.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also considering options for the provision of appropriate visitor facilities for the Burren National Park, County Clare. My officials met officials of Clare County Council before Christmas when it was agreed that ongoing contacts and co-operation will be maintained between the two sides in exploring all the options <Col N="249" /> that may exist throughout the north Clare area for visitor access to the national park and for appropriate control of that access. A complete and careful assessment of the available options will now be made, having specific regard to the issues raised and the concerns expressed in the inspector's report on the Mullaghmore proposal. I have decided, following the meeting of my officials with Clare County Council to which I referred, to appoint external professional consultants to examine all possible sites.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental committee is currently considering the nature of visitor facilities to be developed at the site of the Battle of the Boyne, County Meath. Work is in progress at present to provide new visitor facilities at Maynooth Castle, County Kildare, Ferns Castle, County Wexford, Dungarvan Castle, County Waterford, Lough Hyne, County Cork, the Mainguard, Clonmel, the Warhouse, County Tipperary, and Dunmore Cave, County Kilkenny. As I stated when I recently announced details of the built heritage elements of the national development plan, the emphasis in this regard during the period of the plan, 2000-06, will be on the conservation of heritage properties together with the upgrading of exhibitions and displays at heritage sites.</P>

The Deputy will be aware from previous parliamentary questions on this matter that the total estimated cost of the project is £1.3 million. I fully expect that the balance of the costs will be incurred before the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>Once the castle is open to the public in the second half of 2001, my Department will then be in a position to assess the needs of the site in terms of visitor numbers and facilities and make a determination as to the level, if any, of additional works required to ensure its successful operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 to 146, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as part of the national strategy on road safety, automated speed cameras have been installed in the Louth-Meath division and in north Dublin on a pilot basis. As the Deputy will appreciate, the location of these cameras is based on operational decisions taken by the Garda authorities and the National Roads Authority and neither I nor my Department has a role in relation to these decisions.</P>
      <P>I can also inform the Deputy that following a review of the pilot programme, it is proposed to install automated speed detection cameras at various other locations throughout the State as part of the enforcement measures set out in the national strategy on road safety.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of prosecutions which have arisen from the use of fixed speed cameras for 1999 and 2000, I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of such prosecutions is not readily available. However, the number of detections by means of fixed cameras is 30,230. These detections relate to the year 2000 as fixed cameras only became operational in 2000.</P>
      <P>I should state that speeding offences are, in the main, dealt with by way of on the spot fine and it is only when such fines remain unpaid that court proceedings are instituted. Experience to date has shown that over 80% of speeding fines on the spot are paid without the need to institute court proceedings.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the investigation of such activities in the new environment of the Internet poses special challenges for law enforcement authorities throughout the world. Due to the international nature of Internet based crime, the Garda Síochána liaise with law enforcement agencies and non governmental organisations outside the State in this area of criminality.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to date that there are Internet paedophile rings operating in Ireland. The Garda Síochána are currently carrying out criminal investigations pertaining to breaches of The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition to the specific steps being taken by the Garda in this area, my Department has been involved in a number of relevant structural initiatives arising from the report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet. A public hotline for reporting child pornography was set up in November 1999 and I established an Internet Advisory Board in March 2000 to oversee many of the recommendations the working group's report, including self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry. New protocols for information exchange between the industry and the Garda geared to combating paedophile activity on the Internet continue to be developed under the supervision of the new board.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that each year since 1999, in the first two weeks of March, all licensed horse drawn carriages renew their licences at the Carriage Office, Dublin Castle. At the same time, all horses and carriages are inspected.</P>
      <P>At the time of licensing, carriage operators are cautioned if they loan or rent their carriages to under age or unlicensed drivers, they will be brought before the courts and may have their licences revoked by the authorising officer. I understand that gardaí carry out criminal record checks on all licence applications and renewals.</P>
      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy has been brought to the attention of the Garda authorities. I am further informed by them that initial inquiries at the Carriage Office do not indicate any complaint of the nature specified by the two parties referred to by the Deputy. I further understand that a member of An Garda Síochána will make contact with both parties in this regard.</P>

      <P>In recent years, education services have been extended through the month of July in the case of facilities catering for children with severe/profound general learning disability. I recently announced my intention to introduce a similar extension of service in the case of facilities catering for children with autism.</P>
      <P>In cases where education services are extended through the month of July there is no compulsion on existing school staff, including special needs assistants, to work during the period in question. In the event of such staff choosing to work through the July period additional remuneration is paid. Where special needs assistants on the staff of schools are not available to work during July, the school authorities are free to recruit suitable replacement staff for the period in question. This arrangement worked satisfactorily for the month of July 2000.</P>

      <P>The State's appeal to the Supreme Court in the case of Jamie Sinnott and the Minister for Education and Science, Ireland and the Attorney General is pending and is expected to open at the end of next month. This appeal is being conducted in order to clarify points of law arising from the judgment of Mr. Justice Barr in the case and the appropriate documents of appeal have been <Col N="260" /> lodged in the Supreme Court office. In view of the fact that the Supreme Court now has jurisdiction over this matter it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on the issues arising in the case.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the outcome of this appeal will not affect the damages which have been paid to Jamie Sinnott and his mother. These amount to £42,000 to enable Mrs. Sinnott to put in place a home-based applied behaviour analysis programme for her son. Additionally, £15,000 has also been paid to Mrs. Sinnott to cover expenses already incurred by her in providing an education for Jamie.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be interested to know that the Government has decided to pay all the costs arising from the High Court case and the Supreme Court appeal, whatever the outcome. This is a most unusual step in a case such as this, but it has been taken to ensure that the Sinnott's are not exposed financially in circumstances where the need to have legal certainty on important issues requires an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>In September 2000, when setting up the action group on access to third level education, I announced, as an initial step pending the findings of the group, the introduction of special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders. The new, improved adjacent and non-adjacent rates are £1,000 and £2,000 respectively.</P>

      <Col N="263" /> I expect to receive in the near future the report of the action group and I understand that recommendations relating to the criteria for the special rates of grant will form part of that report.

      <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she or he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
      <P>The managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry, normally implement an enrolment policy and it is their responsibility to devise and implement such a policy. Local circumstances may be such that, from time to time, the board of management of a particular school may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
      <P>My Department will carry out an investigation where it is claimed that a board is operating its enrolment policy in a manner which discriminates against a particular child. On the basis of the details supplied by the Deputy this does not appear to be the case in this instance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, following a meeting with the school authorities in Portlaoise, and visits to several schools in the area last October, I decided to appoint a facilitator to assist in the development of a long-term plan for the provision of primary and post-primary school accommodation in the area. Accordingly, Dr. Tom McCarthy, former senior lecturer in industrial relations at Trinity College and former education officer with SIPTU, was appointed to the position.</P>
      <P>Dr. McCarthy is actively involved in this process at present and has met with representatives of the existing school providers in Portlaoise. He is expected to complete his work in this area in the next month.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to make a decision on how best to address the future primary and postprimary requirements of Portlaoise, as early as possible, following receipt and consideration of Dr. McCarthy's report and recommendations in the matter.</P>
