      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic I have received notice from Deputy Joe Higgins. I call on him to state the matter.</P>

        <b>: </b>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the murderous assault by the Israeli army on the Palestinian nation causing death and injury to innocent people, following suicide bombing atrocities, which also killed many innocent people. The United States apparently supports this state terror by Israel. There is an urgent need for the Irish Government to break away from the United States Government policies in the Middle East region and to promote an independent policy of self-determination and justice for the Palestinian people as well as a secure state for the Israeli people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 48, Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage; No. 19, motion <i>re</i> statement for the information of voters in relation to the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001; and No. 19<i>a</i>, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance [2001] shall be taken on the conclusion of questions to members of the Government </P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that; (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and the motion for the General Financial Resolution shall be moved not later than 12 midnight whereupon business shall then be interrupted and the Dáil shall adjourn forthwith; (2) the Report and Final Stages of No. 48 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Health and Children; (3) No. 19 shall be taken immediately upon the conclusion of No. 48, and shall be decided without debate; (4) following the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and the statements by the main spokespersons of the parties in Opposition, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes; and (5) Question Time tomorrow shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a private notice question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m.; and the order shall resume thereafter.</P>

      <P>There are five proposals to be put to the House. Is the late sitting agreed to? Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 48 agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Noonan: No, sir. I oppose this on the Order of Business. The proposal is that there be a guillotine motion at the end of the Report Stage on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. I do not think this is the way to do business in this House for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published, the Taoiseach communicated with the leaders of the Opposition and asked us to consider approaching this on a consensus basis. We took it at face value. While we raised questions with the Taoiseach and <Col N="1203" /> looked for information, we have not broken on this issue. However, the Taoiseach is now insisting that a guillotine be applied on Report Stage of the Bill, in circumstances where a guillotine has already been applied on Committee Stage. The net effect of this is that not even section 1(2) of the Bill has been adequately debated on Committee Stage and it will not be adequately debated on Report Stage. The remainder of the Bill, including key amendments to section 1(2) are being dealt with by way of Government guillotine. That is not consensus building and the Taoiseach's stated intention of achieving consensus on this issue is totally negated by the procedure he has followed both on Committee Stage and now as proposed on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>This is not ordinary legislation. This is an amendment to the Constitution. It goes to the heart of the Constitution because it deals with Article 40, the personal rights section. The right being discussed and the debate which is being guillotined is about the right to life. It is not a theoretical discussion because at the core of the Government's proposal is restricting a right about the life of pregnant women, which was conceded in the X case by the Supreme Court. Obviously the Taoiseach is aware that a judgment of the Supreme Court on an Article in the Constitution becomes part of the Constitution. So, at the core of this is a delimitation of a right that exists both by the will of the people in 1992 and by judgment of the Supreme Court. I object very strongly to the Taoiseach trying to force this through by way of guillotine. We all know the procedures of the House. If there had been sufficient time on Committee Stage to deal with this issue, we would understand why it might have to go through rapidly on budget morning if the same ground was being discussed again. However, this ground was not discussed on Committee Stage when the guillotine applied.</P>
    <P>There is an emerging lacuna in the Bill which has not been dealt with by the Government or the Minister, namely, the progress made by a scientific team in the United States in cloning human embryos which casts serious doubt on section 1(1). There has not been any attempt by the Minister to deal adequately with this issue. I ask the Taoiseach not to insist on a guillotine today and to provide the additional time available. I do not know of any valid parliamentary reason that Report Stage cannot continue next week. I do not understand why the Government wants to rush this through by 1.30 p.m. in advance of the budget. It would be trite to say there is no connection between this proposal and the budget. I cannot see the urgency. Rather than pushing it to a vote this morning, I appeal to the Taoiseach to accommodate this side of the House by giving additional debating time next week to this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been before the House and the public on a number of occasions. <Col N="1204" /> The Taoiseach indicated that he wants a comprehensive and informed debate and that he wants sufficient time for this to take place outside the House. It is impossible for a reasoned debate to take place outside the House if the people charged with formulating and scrutinising the legislation inside the House have not been able to complete their task. The guillotine imposed on Committee Stage meant that amendments in the names of members of my party and other Opposition Deputies were not reached. Therefore, questions remain unanswered. If they are unanswered in the House, they are incapable of being answered outside the House.</P>
      <P>According to the Taoiseach, there is no rush to have this legislation enacted. He has not yet set the date for the referendum. He is on record as saying it will not take place before the end of January next year. There is ample time beyond that point when it could be held and still allow for the period of time recommended in the sixth report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which specifically called for a proper period of time to elapse between the completion of the legislation in the House, its signature by the President and the date of the referendum. There has already been scrutiny and criticism of other referenda, most recently the referendum on the Nice Treaty. Aside from the merits or demerits of the treaty, many commentators said that the majority of people, when called upon to vote in that referendum, were not aware of the net issues.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan said, the march of scientific progress has not stopped during this debate. The cloning of human embryos is now a scientific reality. We do not have any space in our legislation to deal with the possible ethical abuses of that new scientific reality. It could have been an opportunity to attempt to address some of the issues highlighted in the legislation drafted by Deputy Upton.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, I ask the Taoiseach, before he marches his troops to dutifully vote this down as they have done with every other measure, to explain to the House why we are having this referendum. Is it because he promised it to a member of his family on her death bed or because he has been hijacked by four Independents?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the amount of effort people have put into the debate. As regards the point about time, since September 1997 the Government has dealt with this issue, which has been around for 20 years, in one form or another. I thank people for not having a divisive debate. It might be contentious on some of the issues, but it has been a detailed debate. Since 1997 and the preparation of the Green Paper by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, we have been meticulous in seeking as broad a view on this issue as possible. Unfortunately, it is not an issue on which it is possible to get consensus. It is not the only such issue in life, but moral, social and ethical issues are difficult because people have different perspectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to label them because people are entitled to their views. They expressed those views during the preparation of the Green Paper. For that reason we consulted widely and produced the Green Paper which was widely accepted by everyone, regardless of their views, because it reflected their various suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course of events we would have drafted legislation but because of the type of issue and for the reasons Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn espoused, we brought it to the all-party committee where it was well debated. People did that calmly and professionally. Last summer I read the committee's debate where people argued their positions and articulated their views and the views of those who advised them. They should be commended for that. When the committee finished, it was felt it would be unlikely to reach a consensus, although consensus on the agency was achieved and that has moved on. It was then believed we should bring in outside experts. We brought in obstetricians, gynaecologists and the churches who expressed their views and contributed to the deliberations. The Government, through the Cabinet committee, <Col N="1206" /> went through the issue in considerable detail. The Cabinet committee examined it at all times.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make this issue a political football and I have not done so. Deputy Quinn asked why we are dealing with it. We know there are outstanding issues. Justice Niall McCarthy and an eminent former public servant, Ken Whitaker, who chaired a constitutional committee set up by the previous Taoiseach, told Members of the Oireachtas they had a duty and a responsibility to legislate in this difficult area. They spelt out what we had to do. They said it was a difficult area and that we had left it in a difficult position. I was pressed at least every second week for the past three years about the fact that I, my party and the Government had given a commitment but we were not dealing with it. I explained each time that we were going through the process. My promise was to deal with the question of abortion. It came from an awareness made clear to me both inside and outside the House by almost every group that the judgment in the X case had demonstrated the profound legal difficulties created in the first case by the 1983 referendum and amendment. There was unfinished business. That point was made by Ken Whitaker to the Oireachtas committee and it was said to me several times in the House that the responsibility of parliamentarians is to set guidelines of law as clearly as they can and not to deliberately leave to the courts the settlement of many obscurities. Both of them said that we did not legislate, that we left obscurities and we did not do our job. They also said it is up to the Legislature to express, very clearly, what it wants to be the law of the land.</P>
    <P>Following the judgment in the X case the people voted in 1992 for women to have the right to travel to other jurisdictions to procure abortions and to have information on such services freely available to them. However, we did not deal with the other issues which have remained contentious and difficult. The Government, having gone through a long consultation process, brought the matter to this stage in early October in a calm and cool way. When the Bill was published I said I would answer any questions and use all the advice available. Deputy Noonan went to considerable trouble to ask me to answer a long list of questions about which we had no argument, other than as to how the letter reached my office. I accept that it happened as the Deputy said. Last week I checked again, because I could not recall at the time, and discovered that the Deputy was right.</P>
    <P>We answered the questions and dealt with the issues. I have not been in any way emotive about this and assure Deputy Quinn that I know what he is saying. It was for these reasons and no others that I dealt with it. Looking at the passage of previous legislation through the House it can be seen that we have spent far more time on this issue than we have at other times in the last 20 years. I can go through the litany, if necessary. <Col N="1207" /> We have gone way over time on Second and Committee Stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The select committee had five full days to process the Bill. I said it could take longer if it wished, but it did not so wish. That is the reason we have to press on with the issue. I said at the beginning of this session that the Bill would have to pass through the Oireachtas by Christmas. That is the timeframe the Government has set down for its passage and to which I am going to stick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank those who have contributed to the <Col N="1208" /> debate both here and in the Seanad. Having consulted more widely on the issue than on any other for four and a half years we, on this side of the House, have done our best to put the best possible Bill before the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the people acknowledge this at least, regardless of whether they support the Bill. I hope they will support it, but whatever the case we have done our very best with the best knowledge available. We have listened to the best brains and all the groups which made a case. That is as much as we can do.</P>

      <P>My question arises from the Taoiseach's intervention on the Order of Business. I have no disagreement with his summary of the events which brought us to this point in respect of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill. We have had a long discussion on it and the Select Committee on Health and Children also had a long discussion on it. It is worth noting that no agreement was reached at that committee and that three different positions were adopted at the end of the debate. Does the Taoiseach recall that on the Order of Business he promised Members of the House that everybody who wanted to speak on the Bill would get an opportunity to do so? Does he also recall saying in the House that he thought the issues were so important that Committee Stage should take eight or nine days? Does he recall requesting all of us to approach this matter on a consensual basis so that there would be no contention? Do you recall&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;his actions have belied the position he adopted this morning. He has not sought consensus. He has tried to railroad the Bill through the House. The Government guillotined Second Stage when some Members still wished to speak. The debate was also guillotined on Committee Stage before section 1 had been completed. The Ceann Comhairle will agree it is an enormously serious issue when legislation, which it is proposed to enshrine in the Constitution, was not subject to any scrutiny on Committee or Report Stages beyond section 1. That was the only section of the Bill that received complete analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be frank, I do not know what the medium-term effect of the legislation will be. The Supreme Court may decide in future to adopt a very liberal interpretation of this legislation. It <Col N="1211" /> could be, as in 1983, the door through which a more liberal abortion regime comes into the country. On the other hand, a Supreme Court down the line, depending on its personal composition, could take things back to a more fundamentalist stage where both the right to information and travel could be challenged. In addition, new scientific announcements from the United States make the preservation of life which has not been implanted, both in stem cell research and experiments on <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation, a grey area. Everybody knows that, whatever the nature of such life, it is life outside the womb and is not implanted. Thus, a whole new area of uncertainty has been opened up.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is taking on a huge weight of responsibility in proceeding by way of guillotine with a matter that is so detailed and the interpretation of which may subsequently be so uncertain. I do not doubt the Taoiseach's bona fides on this matter. I know exactly what he wants to achieve and that view can be shared by many people on all sides of the House. However, I question the prudence of what the Taoiseach is doing because this is very like 1983. He may achieve exactly the opposite of what he is setting out to do in the short term when the courts analyse the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a misunderstanding about the nature of legislation going into the Constitution. Such legislation has constitutional protection preventing the Supreme Court from striking it down as unconstitutional when it has passed through the Houses and protecting it from subsequent challenge. There is nothing in the Constitution, however, which prevents the Supreme Court from interpreting not only the subsections being inserted in Article 40, but also the entire Act which is now to be attached to Article 40 of the Constitution at any time in the future. There is no constraint that anybody in this House can place on any Supreme Court at any time in the future from analysing every section.</P>

      <P>When I gave a commitment to deal with this issue, the four Independent Deputies had not been elected. We progressed the matter later in Government, which was a different period and had nothing to do with what happened. As regards the Deputy's second question, I have no idea when the Catholic bishops meet or what is on their agenda. They do not inform me of that, although they may inform the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, I have already said a good deal and I do not want to go back over the matter. I said I would deal with this issue and I was conscious of the fact that it would not be easy. I did it because I knew it was the right thing to do. My priority was the protection of human life in pregnancy. The fundamental purpose of this legislation is the protection both of the pregnant woman and the life she is carrying. That is what we have set out to do and I have no doubt that the people also share that objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did not believe that, I would not have dealt with it. In order to realise that objective, we undertook what has been an extensive process. It has energised the minds of people who take this issue seriously as well as those who, perhaps, do not. We have moved to establish the crisis pregnancy agency, to which the House agreed. People throughout the country have respect for the chairperson of the new agency, Ms Olive Braiden. I also made a point about the responsibility of parliamentarians. This was clearly set down in the judgment by both justices and by Ken Whitaker as part of the task he was given by the previous Government. Mr. Whitaker said the responsibility of parliamentarians is to set guidelines and laws as clearly as they can and that they should not deliberately leave the settlement of a whole lot of obscurities to the courts. It is up to the Legislature to express very clearly what it wants in law. This Government has endeavoured to do that, not overnight but over four and a half years, through the Cabinet committee and the Green Paper and with the assistance of the people who sent in submissions and those who carried out detailed research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the X case judgment, decisions were made which, in some cases, created ambiguities. There are those who believe we should legislate for abortion in this country where a woman is suicidal. That point has been put strongly but we believe that making exceptions in this case would lead to a regime where abortion would be available on demand. In every other country where abortion is permitted on the grounds of mental health, it is generally accepted that this criterion <Col N="1213" /> has created precisely that position. Medical evidence does not tend to support the contention that pregnant women are likely to commit suicide if they cannot have an abortion. For those reasons it is wrong to characterise that as being anti-women. We should remember&mdash;</P>

Between the two extremes, there is a broad mass of people and we tried our best to reflect that.</P>

I do not claim to be an expert on this matter which I have raised with a number of people who are knowledgeable in this area.

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that his fears that the decision on the X case will open the doors to abortion on demand is not borne out by <Col N="1215" /> the facts. The judgment on X, which judgment is now part of the Constitution, was made nine years ago and since then the only recorded analogous case is the C case. Where is the evidence that the X case led or will lead to abortion on demand when over a nine year period there has only been one analogous case, with which Members are familiar? The question is simple. Why, after all he has said, was a guillotine applied during the Second Stage and Committee Stage debate on this Bill which occurred in a committee room rather than in the House? Why does the Taoiseach consider it necessary to guillotine Report Stage at 1.30 p.m.? What is the reason for the rush? Why can he not allow Members to deal with this important legislation fully until the final amendment is moved and disposed of?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>We have had 22 hours of debate on this legislation, far more than we had on recent referendums. The procedure followed is precisely the same as that on other constitutional referendum Bills. Some 14 Members who are not members of the Select Committee on Health and Children attended and participated in the debate on Committee Stage. It was open to the committee to sit longer if it wished. As I said at the start of the session, I wanted to have this Bill dealt with within the session. The Bill which has taken up a considerable amount of Oireachtas time has continued throughout the session and will not be finished until the end of the session. Based on what happened when these issues were far more divisive and difficult in Irish society when we had a 50:50 vote, a much longer time has been accorded to the matter than heretofore.</P>

      <P>On Thursday, 15 November during leaders' questions I raised the contents of the report of the Irish Refugee Council in relation to the accommodation standards some asylum seekers were enduring here. In reply to the quotes I read from the report, into the record of the House, the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>However, accommodation providers and other companies engaged by the State are required to ensure that all accommodation centres comply with and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and other agencies in regard to planning, building by-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general safety. All the planning requirements and statutory regulations are observed and in circumstances where asylum seeking parents and children are accommodated in centres operated by the agency, particular emphasis is placed on meeting their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach may be aware that yesterday in Cork, two asylum seekers blamed this country's authorities for the tragic death of their six month <Col N="1216" /> old son who scalded himself to death with a kettle in their cramped Cork hotel bedroom. The room in question was 13 feet by nine feet and, after four weeks of continually being refused a larger room, they were offered more spacious accommodation only hours after their six month old child died. On the basis of what the Taoiseach must have known, because he was quoting from something at the time, will he now retract what he said on 15 November as being inaccurate? Will he acknowledge that the supervision to which he made reference was not available and that this tragedy was known to the authorities at the time he spoke in the House? On that occasion the Taoiseach either willingly or, more realistically, unwittingly, misled the Dáil. The standards he read into the record of the House were manifestly not maintained on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the issue raised by Deputy Quinn, will the Taoiseach comment on reports that the Government plans to change our citizenship laws, to bring about a situation where the children of refugees and asylum seekers who are born here would not have an automatic right to citizenship. There are reports that the Government intends to change the constitutional position. Is such legislation planned? If so, will it come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Has the Government made a decision on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the matter raised by Deputy Quinn, first I extend sympathy to the family on the tragic loss of their seven month old child. That is the most important point, regardless of the circumstances involved.</P>
      <P>I have the facts regarding the case, information on the family, the reason they moved from Kenmare to Cork and arguments about compliance with the housing Act and other matters, but that does not change the fact that a child died. I do not want to go into the detail of the facts.</P>
      <P>I chair a committee on asylum seekers. It is not only a Cabinet committee, we bring in other agencies involved in this area. An enormous amount of effort goes into purchasing and renting accommodation, making sure it is of a high standard, making sure that the children are in school, that a medical service centre is provided for them and that there is direct provision of food and allowances. All these matters are debated and reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally felt not only by the agencies here but externally that we are probably one of the best on this, but like everything else, we must keep abreast of developments. There have been many problems in getting accommodation and a great deal of effort has gone into that. The people involved are very committed, dedicated and sincere about providing adequate accommodation, even though the figures have greatly risen in recent years. The Minister's answers to this during Question Time are chapter and verse. We <Col N="1217" /> keep pressure on ourselves to deal with this matter as best we can.</P>
    <P>A major problem is to obtain adequate accommodation for these people and to get others to accept and respect them. We have battles about this practically everywhere we try to obtain accommodation and they have to be worked through. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others spend an enormous amount of time trying to convince people to allow asylum seekers into their communities. That is what is happening. The accommodation position has improved a good deal in terms of capacity in different places.</P>
    <P>In reply to the matter raised by Deputy Noonan, there is no legislation promised in this area. Many of those working in the maternity hospitals have highlighted the enormous growth in the number of pregnant women who come to the hospitals within a few days of arriving here and those people are quite clear on their entitlements and what it means if their babies are born in Ireland. This matter has been raised loudly and clearly with the Government in recent times by the maternity hospitals and other interests and we have examined it, but we have no proposals to amend legislation in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with what he read into the record on 15 November? It states that he said to me that when he contacted the relevant section earlier he was told that cots are provided in each reception and accommodation centre where infants are accommodated and toilet and bathroom facilities are provided in accordance with whatever are the relevant statutory requirements. He said that the memorandum agreement stipulates that, as a minimum, cots, which were mentioned in the report, infant formulae, infant food, access to fresh water for the preparation of infant formulae, sterilisers sufficient for a number of infant children, water boiling facilities, refrigerators, microwaves and bottle warmers, must be provided.</P>
      <P>This tragic accident happened on 6 March. Somebody in Government services withheld the information from the Taoiseach. They allowed the Taoiseach to read that into the record, knowing that in the case of one tragic accident of which we know, that was not true. Where this accident took place that led to the death from shock of this seven month old infant, there was no table on which to place the kettle. The kettle of boiling water was on the floor. After several seconds of screaming the toddler went quiet and died before it could be admitted to the South Infirmary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to do two things, to make an inquiry in the Department as to why he was misled and to apologise publicly now on the record for the criticisms he made of the report when he tried to rubbish its conclusions which state that conditions of this kind exist. We have proof of that, tragically for all concerned. This is no way to treat a human being. It is no way for the Taoiseach of this country to be treated by the <Col N="1218" /> authorities who are responsible to report to him which led him to mislead the Dáil on that occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a major issue on the tragic loss of a child's life. I have the report put forward by the people in the agency. From reading it, it seems, in fairness to the staff involved, whom I do not know, that they did everything possible before and after this tragedy to help the family. It would be wrong for me not to defend the staff. Yet the seven month old child was scalded in the centre and subsequently died in the South Infirmary. The people who prepared the note believe that the size of the room was appropriate and that they had provided the necessary facilities, yet a tragic accident happened.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Quinn would accept that regardless of the size of one's home, tragic accidents can happen. It is not fair to abuse the members of the staff. The report indicates that because the child was sick they had to arrange to move the family from Kenmare to Cork city and in all the arrangements afterwards the representatives of the Southern Health Board seem to have done everything for them. This is a tragedy for the family and every Member of this House, including myself, have the deepest sympathy for them.</P>
      <P>I contend that the greatest of efforts are made by the Government, the agencies and the organisations to help asylum seekers in every way that we can. We have invested tens of millions of pounds in recent years in providing accommodation, resources, staffing, education and health services and will continue to do so. It is an obligation the country feels it has to these people. Ours is considered in many places to be the most liberal and easiest of regimes and some people outside here regularly say that because of that our system is abused to an enormous extent.</P>

Yesterday the Dublin City Coroner presiding over an inquest into the stabbing of a 12 year old called <Col N="1219" /> on the Oireachtas to urgently reform the coroners legislation to allow additional medical evidence to be introduced.

I do know if the Taoiseach is aware that the Attorney General yesterday acquiesced in a date in April being given for the mini-CTC judicial review, which means that it cannot conclude its work and falls with the Dáil.

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I outlined some of the problems I had with the section we are now discussing. I now want to refer to a number of other aspects. I raise these issues because I passionately believe that our response to the issue of abortion should be to do something about the reality of abortion. That might sound odd, but it is not, because if we are considering any proposal on abortion &ndash; constitutional, legislative or otherwise &ndash; we have to determine whether it will do anything in the area of abortion and, in particular, crisis pregnancies. That is the first litmus test any proposal has to pass. Having gone through the all-party committee and studied its proposals, I genuinely do not believe the Minister's proposal will reduce the number of abortions by a single case. Does he believe it will have the desired effect of reducing the abortion rate? This is my major problem with the proposal. It is the reason I proposed at the all-party committee that we should focus on an action plan to deal with crisis pregnancies in a real attempt to reduce the num<Col N="1224" /> ber of abortions and at times bored my colleagues by later persisting with the view.</P>
      <P>The litmus test for the proposal is whether it will do anything about crisis pregnancies. The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Constitutional or legislative proposals cannot impact on abortions carried out in Ireland because there are none. When I proposed an action plan to deal with crisis pregnancies, my concern was that by focusing on legislative and constitutional measures we would divert attention and energy from the real problem, which is what happened. During the many hours discussing the new, detailed definitions of abortion and other matters there has been virtually no debate on how we might deal with crisis pregnancies.</P>
      <P>At long last the Government has announced that a crisis pregnancy agency will be established. Since my original proposal to set up a crisis pregnancy agency 18 months ago, there have been 10,000 abortions, yet only now has the Government proposed to set up such an agency. This is a matter of concern. A proposal for such an agency is just the beginning. The real question is what will it do.</P>
      <P>Although we examined the kind of preventative measures which should be introduced to discourage crisis pregnancies at the all-party committee, the current debate has not focused on the matter. The all-party committee heard some interesting evidence. There were genuine and major differences of view on prevention. Some people focused on contraception and its availability, while others felt the main emphasis should be on discouraging early sexual intercourse among the young population. This, again, has not been discussed here. If we are concerned about reducing the rate of abortion, we should discuss these kinds of issues. They are the real issues in the real world as far as abortion is concerned because there are, I repeat, no abortions in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Our abortion rate is the 7,000 women and girls who travel to the UK every year. If we genuinely care about doing something about it, we should focus our attention on trying to introduce measures to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies in the first place, after which we should highlight the possibilities other than abortion available to those women who are in this vulnerable position. We should examine the newer forms of adoption and the financial and other supports which should be made available to pregnant women, none of which has been discussed.</P>
      <P>Having done this, we should discuss the position of the 100,000 Irish girls and women who have had abortions in the past 20 years. They have been ignored from two points of view &ndash; their need for medical check ups and their need for counselling services. Have arrangements been made to deal with these matters? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the issues at the coalface as far as abortion is concerned. My plea to the Government and my colleagues is that we try to achieve consensus on the introduction of a strategy for dealing with crisis pregnancies as soon as poss<Col N="1225" /> ible. This is the only way we will impact on the rate of abortion. The alternative, a constitutional amendment and a constitutionally guaranteed Bill, will not impact on a single abortion. This raises several questions. Why has the Government chosen to adopt this approach? Why did it not address the issue of abortion long ago? Why was the crisis pregnancy agency not established when we first proposed it? Why was a proper strategy for the agency not among the real issues debated? </P>
    <P>This is the last day the Bill will be before the Dáil. I make a final plea, even at this late stage in the dying hours of this dying Administration, to focus on this issue, which is the real issue with respect to abortion. I very much regret there has been such nominal reference to it during the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I do not recall a Government spokesman claiming the legislation <i>per se</i> or the proposed amendment to the Constitution would deter anybody from seeking an abortion abroad. Side by side with the legislation there is a strategy being put in place. Deputy O'Keeffe is correct to state it should have been put in place by previous Governments. They should have dealt with the matter and we are all responsible and negligent to some extent in that the strategy has not been put in place until now. It is a useless exercise to look back in history. A strategy is being put in place. What we are discussing today is the Report Stage of legislation, which tries to make the law reflect what we think is the will of the people. That remains to be tested.</P>
      <P>Last night, Deputy O'Keeffe stated there was much confusion among the public and many people do not seem to understand what the Government is doing. He is perfectly correct. This is not unusual with constitutional referenda. Many people will focus on the issues once the date has been set for the referendum and the campaign is under way. However, I respectfully put it to Deputy O'Keeffe and others that if we want to go on extending the legislation and inserting matters like defining the moment at which life begins, etc., that will be a recipe which will spread confusion from one end of the country to the other.</P>
      <P>In so far as Deputy McManus's argument in relation to a possible conflict between Article 40.3.3º and Article 40.3.4º, I understand exactly where she is coming from, but her fears are groundless. As the Minister said, the two different Articles of the Constitution must be read together. It is a fundamental principle of interpretation of constitutional legislation that different Articles of the Constitution are presumed to be in harmony. If anybody wants to contend otherwise, the onus is on them to establish that there is genuine conflict and it is a very heavy onus to discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> In any case, there is no conflict between the two Articles, Article 40.3.3º and Article 40.3.4º, as I understand them. If I am reading the position correctly, the protection provided for both mother and child in Article 40.3.3º extends until the moment of implantation. From that moment on the appropriate protection is that provided in Article 40.3.4º and the proposed legislation which it underpins. It is not a question of two different Articles of the Constitution being in conflict in relation to a particular situation. The two different Articles&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The two different Articles of the Constitution apply to two different timeframes. Until the moment of implantation the law appropriate to both mother and child is that laid down in Article 40.3.3º, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. From the moment of implantation onwards it is the law laid down in Article 40.3.4º together with the legislation which it underpins.</P>
      <P>To answer the hypothetical question which Deputy McManus raised, if I can recall the details properly, as to what happens after implantation, the position we are trying to establish &ndash; if this referendum is passed by the people and the legislation goes on the Statute Book, this will be the position &ndash; is that from the moment of implantation on, suicide is not a valid reason to seek a termination of a pregnancy and anybody who seeks and procures termination of a pregnancy on the basis she says she is suicidal will be liable and in breach of the legislation. The person will, in effect, be committing abortion as proposed in the legislation.</P>
      <P>That is the position. I know it is a complex area. I do not want to over-simplify it in any way or do not want to be seen to seek to over-simplify it, but I decry the efforts of those who want to try to complicate it unnecessarily either because they have a different agenda. As I say, there is a fundamental principle of constitutional interpretation that different Articles of the Constitution are supposed to be read as if they are in harmony. If there are a number of possibly different interpretations, the interpretation which leads to one Article being in harmony with the other is the appropriate interpretation to take. Second, there is no conflict between Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º because they apply to different situations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we are discussing is amendment No. 1, which proposes to delete lines 14 to 20 on page four of the Bill. Those are the lines in the Bill which actually deal with the amendments which it is proposed to make to the <Col N="1227" /> Constitution which are set out in the First Schedule. The second and third parts of that proposed amendment are really the key ones as far as the activity of the House and the Oireachtas is concerned. The proposed second part of that amendment provides that if a law, containing only the provisions set out in this Bill, is enacted by the Oireachtas, this section, other than the amendment of Article 40 of the Constitution effected thereby, shall be omitted from every official text of the Constitution. The third part states that if such a law is not so enacted within 180 days of this section being added to the Constitution, this section shall cease to have effect.</P>
      <P>That is the provision for what I have called a Bill within a Bill which is designed to tell the Oireachtas that in the event that a referendum on this issue is carried, then the Oireachtas can do only one of two things: it can either pass the Bill, the text of which we have here, or it can refuse to pass it.</P>
      <P>If the amendment is carried, a Bill will come formally before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That Bill has, in its current draft, seven sections, and does a number of things to which I will come in a moment. The Oireachtas will be invited to consider it and decide to pass it as it stands or not to pass it. The Oireachtas will be told, &ldquo;You can pass this or reject it, but you cannot amend it,&rdquo; on the basis that the people will have said, &ldquo;We are voting on the basis that this Bill will be passed into law.&rdquo; That is a procedure which should not be entered into lightly. It is a procedure which we should avoid as far as possible. It is a procedure in which we do not need to engage in the context of the referendum about which we are talking.</P>
      <P>We spoke about this in committee when I asked what would happen if the Oireachtas, duly invited to pass this Bill, in its wisdom decided not to do so within 180 days. The Oireachtas would be saying, &ldquo;We do not agree with the people,&rdquo; but it would be doing its job. It would be doing something which is plainly envisaged as a possibility in the text of the proposed constitutional amendment because, as I have said, the third part of the amendment reads:</P>
      <P>If such a law is not so enacted within 180 days of this section being added to this Constitution, this section shall cease to have effect . . .</P>
      <P>Therefore it is envisaged, at least as a possibility, that the Oireachtas might decide to take a different view from that expressed by the people in the referendum and might decide not to pass that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also speculated on Committee Stage on what the position might be if there is a referendum on this, if we ever get consensus on a date for it, if the Tánaiste comes to the conclusion that she agrees that there is enough consensus for the Government to specify a date about which there are many uncertainties, and it is followed in less than 180 days by a general election, which seems to be the likelihood. In that case, there will be a <Col N="1228" /> Dáil with a different composition and it might take a different view. Of course, on Committee Stage there was the following inevitable inane comment from a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, &ldquo;Is Deputy Dukes threatening to do away with this if we have a general election?&rdquo; Leaving aside the political smart-alec comments, there is a definite possibility, a certainty, that the next Dáil will have a different complexion in some ways from this one. It might take a different view on this issue and I would not be at all surprised to find that in the next Dáil there will be people on the Fianna Fáil benches who would take a different view from the one they are being whipped to take today.</P>
    <P>I know that there are Members on the Fianna Fáil benches who hold a different view from the one that they are whipped to express on this issue and might find themselves in a position in the next Dáil where they might be free to state and act on it in this Chamber, but there are other possibilities. This Government, which hopes to put this through and envisages having a referendum, is one which is supported by four Independent Deputies. I gather some of the Independent Deputies are feeling rather tender about the way they think the Opposition feels about them. They should not worry too much because they are all regarded with a certain amount of warmth, but the fact of the matter is that they are all lining up solidly with the Government's position on this.</P>
    <P>We may have more single issue candidates in the next Dáil. There is at least a possibility that a future Government could rely on the support of a number of Independent Deputies who could adopt a very different view from the current four honest, diligent, unswerving Government supporters. If such Deputies were to take the opposite view it could be impossible, even for a Government including Fianna Fáil, to pass this legislation. We would then find ourselves, having undergone this upheaval, being required to pass or reject this legislation. This is something the Oireachtas would be entitled to do but, if it were to happen, many people with whom I disagree would have voted in a particular way on this referendum and would rightly feel badly let down. We should not run the risk of this happening as it would not enhance the public's view of the political process.</P>
    <P>I asked on Second and Committee Stages whether all of this was necessary and, although I waited for an answer, the Minister studiously avoided providing one. Does he consider this process to be the only way to deal with these complex issues? I do not, although there are those in the House who disagree with me. The Bill encompassed in the Bill to amend the Constitution includes a definition of abortion and provides for the granting of legal sanction to current medical practices in a particular area. It also contains an implicit legalisation of the morning after pill and IUDs and the overturning of the case law in the X-case, meaning the exclusion of suicidal intent as grounds for abortion. These are the issues the <Col N="1229" /> Oireachtas will be required to legislate for or reject in the event that this Bill is passed in its current form. Is this the only way of proceeding?</P>
    <P>Section 1(1) of the Bill within the Bill defines abortion. That is not necessary in the context of a Bill on which the Oireachtas is presented with a Hobson's choice &ndash; pass it or junk it but do not amend it. If we want to define abortion, the simplest way of doing so is to amend the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 in whatever way is considered necessary. The Government says that, for the purposes of dealing with the problem of abortion, we will define it as meaning the &ldquo;intentional destruction, by any means, of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman&rdquo;. If we were to amend the 1861 Act to substitute that definition for the references in that Act to procuring a miscarriage, we could apply the penalties provided for to abortion. The intention of this measure is really to bring that up to date and square it with what we now consider a proper definition of abortion.</P>
    <P>In not one of the Government's responses to this issue has there been any systematic examination of why it would be wrong to achieve its objectives by amending the 1861 Act. I have not seen any analysis of what that would mean nor have I seen any conclusive demonstration that it would be in any way wrong, undesirable or difficult to proceed in that way. If we want to give the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; the meaning that is set out here, it would be simpler to return to the 1861 Act and write in the appropriate definition, instead of going through this rigmarole of constitutional and legislative action. The Government has not even considered that as an operational way of resolving this problem. I have my views as to why it has not and they do not reflect well on the Government.</P>
    <P>The legalisation of the morning after pill and IUDs by this means is a by-product of that definition of abortion and the Government's grass has been cut on the morning after pill already because decisions have been made elsewhere that simply say that the types of morning after pill permitted are not abortifacients so we need not worry or consider them to be illegal. I assume the same logic applies to the IUD. I am not alone in the House in adopting this view. Many of us did not have to wait for expert medical opinion to give us that read on the morning after pill and IUDs. This legalisation, which the Government has made part of its case on this issue, is a by-product of the definition of abortion. To the extent that it was needed it would be secured, whichever way we went about making this definition of abortion operational, and it would follow for making the appropriate amendments to the 1861 Act. Those two objectives of this Bill within a Bill could be achieved by a simple, straightforward and easily comprehensible amendment of the 1861 Act without undergoing the constitutional and legislative mumbo-jumbo with which the Government has saddled us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> The third measure contained in section 1(2) of this Bill within a Bill proposes to give legal backing to current medical practices which have been described and debated at length by people who are far more competent than me. The Government is telling us that in order to reassure people that particular procedures, interventions or treatments, currently available and accepted as ethical, will continue to be legally available and accepted as ethical, we must insert this subsection into the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister think this really means? We would not simply be giving legal backing and legal authority to the procedures and practices which exist today, we would be giving legal backing, sanction and foundation to whatever those practices might be at any given time during the legislation's existence. Will the Minister or the Members of the Oireachtas decide what those practices may be? The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We would hand over the decision as to what is legal, ethical and permitted to another group of people, namely the doctors. No definition of procedures is provided. The reference is to the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner. What we are saying, therefore, is that we will legalise whatever medical practitioners consider ethical and proper. I do not wish to disparage anyone or accuse them of bad faith, but this means that the Oireachtas is handing over its power to decide what is ethical in this area to people outside. That is of concern to many people.</P>
    <P>We are not only saying that whatever is legal today will continue to be legal, but that whatever they decide at any moment should be legal and ethical is so and we will back them without question and without any power to influence or require consultation on the matter. That is an odd way to legislate. It might be more honest to have a subsection in the Bill that provides that whatever the IMO says, at any time, goes. That is not a criticism of the IMO but it can change its views. It did so earlier this year and that is fact. We are handing over the power to decide what is proper, ethical and legal to a group of people who are entitled to, and do, change their views from time to time. We are saying that whatever they decide is fine by us and we will give them legal backing for it. That is what this Bill does.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister of State shaking his head at me. He knows that I speak the truth. This does not give the Oireachtas any power to inspect what is being regarded as ethical or to modify it in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I mean the Medical Council. There is nothing here that gives the Oireachtas any power to come back and question what the Medical Council says or to recommend that it does anything different. At any point in time this says, in effect, that what the Medical Council says goes. I am not criticising the Medical Council, but the Legislature should not do that.</P>
      <P>Two of the Bill's proposals, as mentioned, can be dealt with by simple, straightforward and comprehensible amendments of the 1861 Act. The third requires more thought than the Government has given it here. It would be preferable to have a provision that gave the Oireachtas some role in deciding what these practices should be. If we go to the trouble of having a constitutional amendment on the issue and of writing into the amendment the requirement that the Oireachtas pass a law about it, then it is important enough for the Oireachtas to want to stay part of the decision process and any future changes. It would be much more desirable to make a provision that would give the Oireachtas some ongoing association with decisions. I do not know what that association might be but it is certainly not this provision, dragged in by a constitutional amendment with an invitation to the Oireachtas to agree or disagree with the people. That is not the way to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The fourth proposal in this complex paper is the deletion of the existence of suicidal intent as a ground for an abortion. That is the effect of those few words in lines 15 and 16 on page 8 of the Bill. It speaks of procedures that, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, are necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life &ldquo;other than by self-destruction&rdquo;. Those four words are the key to this and they are why we are here. What the Government wants to do is to satisfy the judgment given by the courts in the X case. We are having a referendum that deals with all these issues, the Bill within a Bill, the definition of abortion, the morning after pill, IUDs and legislation for the protection of current medical practices. It is not because we want to do only those things or because we want to do them in an efficient, clear and transparent way, but because the Government wants to row back the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case. We should not do that but the Government clearly takes a different view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been more desirable and much clearer if the Government said plainly that it wanted to row back the X case and it needed a constitutional amendment to do it. I agree that a <Col N="1232" /> constitutional amendment is needed to do it. The debate would have been clearer and there would have been less argument and hassle if the Government had decided to do it. However, the Government has decided to have this Bill within a Bill and I know why. The Government wanted to have a referendum on rowing back the X case. It is pandering to people who take the same view and who have said consistently since 1981 that they do not trust legislators. They know it would not be enough to have that little piece in the Constitution that says we row back the X case because they do not trust what the Government might do afterwards. They need to follow up on it so the Government, supinely and cravenly, agreed that it is not trustworthy and decided to put what it will do into the constitutional amendment also to prevent a change of mind afterwards. If it changes its mind, it will be seen to go against the expressed will of the people.</P>
    <P>A Government that takes that view and brings before the Oireachtas legislation designed to bind its hands, just because it accepts the proposition of people who do not trust politicians, deserves to be thrown out of office immediately. It is a Government that is giving in and pandering to an opinion that is not justified. I will not make a liar of myself and say that I have absolute trust in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and I will not insult anybody by picking them out. I am never sure it will do what it says it will do, but I am prepared to debate with it in the House and I do not require it to bind itself with oaths, promises or constitutional amendments of this kind. Those who say they do not trust the politicians to get it right are the people who consistently, spectacularly, and with every confidence, have got it wrong since 1981. They are the people who told us in 1981 and 1982 that a simple form of words as an amendment to the Constitution would rid us of this problem for ever. They produced a situation where what was clear before, because we had only the 1861 Act, became unclear. Without that wording in the Constitution, which they said would put this problem beyond our ken forever, we could not have had the court judgment in the X case.</P>
    <P>Now they realise that they got it wrong and come again with the same certainty that they have it right and that we cannot be trusted. In fact, although I pay no unnecessary or excessive compliments to the present Government, this House has a better record of getting things right and a better mechanism for mending things that go wrong than those who urge us to bind ourselves with this measure. The Oireachtas has the power to amend legislation. It can examine its effects and, if it is not having the desired effect, it can amend it. However, the Government proposes to deprive the Oireachtas of the ability to re-examine this matter if, in the future, we find it does not have the intended effect since any change can only happen through referendum.</P>
    <P>The Government seeks to tie the hands of the Oireachtas and prevent it from doing something <Col N="1233" /> that parliaments have an obligation to do, and that, by and large, they show themselves capable of doing. One can easily think of cases where legislation passed by this House has had a different effect from that wanted and so has been amended. The Minister knows what I am talking about. He even proposes amendments at this Stage, which illustrates that he is still thinking and modifying his approach to this measure and the Bill's provisions to match more closely his intentions. As that is so, why does he seek to bind our hands and prevent the Oireachtas from having a power that a Parliament should always have and seek to retain? There are issues that must be referred to the people under the Constitution and it is right that they should be, but the Oireachtas should not surrender its constitutional power, prerogatives and duties to anyone else.</P>
    <P>The guillotine will come down today and I have a terrible image of Deputy O'Dea sitting with his knitting needles at its foot watching the blade come down, chop chop, at each Stage of this debate. However I will not go into that as the mind boggles. It would be horror writ large.</P>

      <P>Before the guillotine falls, the Minister should tell us why he believes we cannot enact three of the four measures contained here by legislation properly passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas elected by the people under the Constitution to do so, and to leave the one constitutional issue to be put separately to the people. Why does the Minister set his face against the ordinary legislative procedure and instead complicate measures with this Bill within a Bill? It is unnecessary and the Minister has not given one reason for doing it. Because it is so complicated, the Minister will get a verdict from the people &ndash; if he can agree a date with the Tánaiste to hold the referendum &ndash; which says that this is as clear as a bush and they will not have it. That will be a good day's work by them.</P>

        <b>: </b>I deplore strongly the time constraints placed on the discussion of the Bill. I regret that I was not involved in the Committee Stage, but others did well in pointing out the many flaws in the Bill, its repugnant nature and its inconsistencies. The guillotine today will not allow discussion to be brought to a proper conclusion. The Government ought to consider amending or withdrawing the Bill. It should have learned lessons from the history of sensitive issues dealt with by the crude mechanism of a constitutional amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Gay Mitchell's amendment which seeks the deletion of lines 14 to 20 on page four, which refers to the contents of page seven, Cuid a hAon as Gaeilge, and Part Two in English. There is a clear conflict between Article 40.3.3º <Col N="1234" /> and the proposed Article 40.3.4º in this provision. This conflict may return to haunt the Government and it should think again if it believes this is the end of litigation on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea accuses some of us of complicating the issue for our own agendas, but, unfortunately for him, it is reality and the experience of life that complicate the issue. Cases which arose and convulsed this State were unforeseen before 1983. Those who argued that difficult situations could arise were rubbished then and accused of complicating the issue but life vindicated them. The Government's constitutional amendment, particularly Article 40.3.4º, gives an embryo a greater right than the woman carrying it. Inevitably, its conflict with Article 40.3.3º will have consequences. It is clear that this legislation, to rule out the danger of suicide as grounds for legal termination, is in direct contravention of what is already in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Down the line the Government will be seen not to have done what it set out to do with this legislation. It is reprehensible that it brings forward this legislation simply to close an opening made by a judgment of the Supreme Court and does so for nakedly political reasons. That is the fundamental reason that this Bill is being brought before us now.</P>
    <P>There is a huge dishonesty in the Bill; it is built on dishonesty. It is built on the attempt to pervert language as an expression of reality, an honest expression of what exists in life. Therefore in the Bill the abortion of a foetus made necessary by the illness of a pregnant woman and in order to save her life does not become an abortion at all. It is a fundamentally dishonest proposal which allows the Government to bring forward and implement some guarantees it gave to certain minority sections of society in its own political interests.</P>
    <P>Hammering into the Constitution the type of legislation provided for here and in Part 2 is a crude mechanism. It is an extremely inflexible way to deal with issues that will continue to develop as society and the attitudes and ideas of people develop. Having something frozen in the Constitution is not the way to deal with issues that are developing on an ongoing basis. There is no doubt that the attitude of the people with regard to the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy has shifted massively in the course of recent decades and will shift further in the future as the experience of life is taken more into account by them. Here the Government wants to insert something into the Constitution in order to pickle and copperfasten it rather than dealing with these matters through legislation which can be reformed and amended and brought up to date in line with experience and the views of the people.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy is a political one which, unfortunately, will come apart. It is taking what it believes to be the so-called middle ground and the strategy is to appeal to it and the minorities opposed to a woman's right to choose and in <Col N="1235" /> this way gain some crude political advantage in the run-up to the general election. The Government hopes in this way to copperfasten for itself a few percentage points that might make the difference between being in or out of government after the election. It has nothing to do with the interests of women, justice for women or women's rights or any moral question; it is crude political expediency which is designed to make the pro-choice section of society seem extreme. This is a favourite Government tactic to attempt to cast as extremists those who stand for the right of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy. It is not an extreme position to respect the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy; it is the experience of thousands of Irish women who do so every year. It is insulting to deal with the issue in this manner by, in effect, continuing to marginalise the women concerned in the way that this legislation and the Government strategy do.</P>
    <P>I will finish by drawing attention to the extreme political difficulties that the Government is going to face on this matter in the months ahead. I predict that its political strategy will come apart at the seams. For example, what will the Catholic Church state in regard to this legislation? There are a number of issues in the Bill which are fundamentally repugnant to Catholic teaching. The post-coital pill and the intra-uterine device are utterly repugnant to Catholic teaching. Will the Catholic Church, as it has a right to do for its own believers, state publicly that no Catholic should support this legislation because it is enshrining contraceptive practices that it fundamentally opposes? Where will that leave the Government with its consensus and attempt to keep the middle ground? Will the Catholic Church be dishonest and keep quiet on the matter on the basis that this is an enshrinement of its position and a step towards further restrictions on women's rights in these matters? </P>
    <P>The Catholic Church will be dishonest if it stays quiet on this issue. The logic of the debate may well be that the Government will face the same problem that it faced with the Nice treaty. It could come a cropper through a similar alignment of voting by disparate groups: those who are fundamentally in favour of a woman's right to choose and those who are morally opposed to any concession to either a morning after pill or any form of termination whatsoever. What will the Government do if the main Church on the island opposes the Bill? Will it then press on with the referendum?</P>
    <P>It is shameful legislation which criminalises women by tagging a penalty of 12 years in prison onto any woman who would attempt to self-administer a termination of pregnancy. It flies in the face of all the words of alleged compassion coming from the Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach who when he launched the Bill spoke about the thousands of sad stories of women travelling abroad to avail of terminations. He said they must be listened to and <Col N="1236" /> appreciated. Instead the Government proposes 12 years imprisonment for those who would choose, perhaps out of desperation, to self-administer a termination in the State. That is quite incredibly uncaring and lacking in compassion. It is a marginalisation of the tens of thousands of women who have availed of termination of pregnancy. It keeps them on the margins and ignores their stories and does so for political expediency. The State should not interfere in this matter other than to see that people's health is protected and proper procedures are in place in cases where women decide they have to choose to terminate a pregnancy. That is the reality the State will have to face. It would have had to face it long ago if it were not for the convenient back door of pagan England being there. If Irish women were dying in the back streets as a result of back street abortions, which would have been forced on them if Britain were not there, the law in this country would have been changed long ago because there would be a clamour to change it. Even people with a moral difficulty who would never choose abortion for themselves would have to recognise that right should exist for the people caught up in those circumstances. It is a bad day's work and I oppose the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I will try to avoid repeating things already covered by other speakers. It is regrettable this debate is taking place today. The Government has taken an extraordinary measure. It has ordered a constitutional referendum Bill and then tried to constrain and design the debate within the Houses of the Oireachtas in a manner that is practically guaranteed to ensure minimum public knowledge of what happens here and as little reportage as possible.</P>
      <P>We had a Committee Stage that had practically no coverage in the national press, other than, I think, <i>The Irish Times</i>, which gave it some small coverage. There were no particular references to it on national news bulletins. We have a guillotine debate today, budget day, when, as the Government is well aware, the only reportage from this House in any of tomorrow's papers or any of the news bulletins from 5 o'clock onwards will be the budget debate. This is an extraordinary way to try to ensure information is available to the general public to understand the issues involved, should this matter be put to the people. It is an even more extraordinary way to try and secure what was described as political consensus on all sides of the House. In my time in this House, I have not seen any referendum issue dealt with in this way and it is an extraordinary way to approach this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was right when he said there is no need for a constitutional referendum to enact the Bill other than the fact that the Bill envisaged excludes the X case principles. It seeks to ensure that, should a pregnant woman or teenage girl be suicidal, she cannot effect a termination of her pregnancy in this State. That is the sole issue of substance that requires a referendum. This is an <Col N="1237" /> action replay of the 1992 referendum, dressed up in different clothing. I would have more respect for the Government if it honestly reproduced the 1992 proposal and said it disagreed with the outcome of that referendum. It should have said it had a moral view that this is the way the law should be changed and it was willing to debate that in public.</P>

      <P>&mdash;in the presence of four Independent Deputies who have not the courage to participate in any aspect of this debate here. The four Independents were not seen on Committee or Report Stages. They are back in hiding. Is it a voluntarily imposed hiding or is it another example of the Government Whip kidnapping Independent Deputies and ensuring they are kept out of the House so they do not suffer public foot in mouth disease that could result in removing any credibility, which might be left with this measure, by, for example, the type of <i>exposé</i> in which Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae might engage?</P>
      <P>We should not be doing this exercise. We should approach this issue with considerably more honesty. On Committee Stage, I raised an issue on which I received no coherent or straightforward reply from the Minister. We are dressing up this debate and discussing whether it is acceptable that a pregnancy may or may not be terminated in circumstances where the pregnant woman or teenage girl is suicidal. In most instances where there is a possibility someone may be suicidal as a result of a pregnancy, it is where pregnancy is a consequence of rape or incest. We should not talk of that issue in the context of suicide. It is time to recognise in a mature way if a woman or young girl is the victim or rape or incest and becomes pregnant, it is an additional cruelty to deny the victim the right to decide if she wants to maintain that pregnancy. We are saying we will force her to maintain it in this country but if she wants to get on a plane and go abroad, she may be allowed to terminate the pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the challenge to the Minister, if his wife or daughter were the victim of rape and pregnant, would he like to have available to her the facility to terminate that pregnancy. This is a straightforward question. How many Government Deputies, who support this Bill and who found their wife, daughter, niece or neighbour's child was pregnant as a consequence of rape, would say she should not have her pregnancy terminated here? Fortuitously, England is only next door so she could get on a plane if she wishes, but in Ireland we will not allow this whether she is suicidal or not. In a <Col N="1238" /> more mature society we would recognise there are circumstances in which we should more honestly discuss this issue. This Bill is purely about reversing the consequences of the X case and the way in which this debate has been ordered is designed to delimit the contributions the Members of this House can make.</P>
    <P>I am conscious there are other Members who want to speak and I do not intend to raise all the issues I raised either on Second or Committee Stages. However, I draw the Minister's attention to yet another anomaly in this legislation, which has been worked upon by the Government for four and a half years and over which the Minister wants to stand. He now recognises it needs amendment and there are four ministerial amendments tabled for today.</P>
    <P>It has another peculiarity to which nobody has yet referred. The Bill the Dáil will chose to enact or reject, following a referendum, if the referendum is passed, contains section 6. This section says: &ldquo;Sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, are hereby repealed&rdquo;. If the Bill is enacted, the effect of that provision is to immediately repeal those sections. What does that mean? It means if someone is being prosecuted for an unlawful termination by usage of the provisions under the Offences against the Person Act, at the time when this Bill is enacted, that prosecution has to cease and anyone who has carried out an unlawful abortion in this State, prior to the enactment of this Bill, is given by this Minister a legislative and constitutional amnesty. This is something to which no one has yet referred. We have had the tax amnesty, now we will have an amnesty granted to those people with whom the Minister says he wants to deal, people who may carry out unlawful abortions.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions as justice spokesperson for Fine Gael and in other capacities, I have seen many criminal law Bills discussed in this House. If a new criminal offence is replacing an old one, a criminal law Bill will usually contain a section, which is a preservation provision. This preserves in being the law as it was at the time when the Bill was enacted in respect of outstanding offences, for which prosecutions have been initiated. Section 6 does not do that. If the referendum succeeds and the Bill is enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas and a person is charged with the offence of carrying out an unlawful termination under the Offences Against the Person Act, the signing of the Bill by the President will grant an amnesty to those people. The criminal offence of which they have been charged will be struck out.</P>

      <P>I want to refute a point made by Deputies Dukes, Jim O'Keeffe, O'Dea, Joe Higgins and Shatter and a number of speakers yesterday. We have had a Second Stage debate this morning. There has not been any attempt to discuss each amendment separately, which is fair enough. I have heard all the points, with the exception of one or two, on Second and Committee Stages. The points made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe about the crisis pregnancy agency are valid. We did not say at the outset that the legislation would deal with the issue of crisis pregnancies or abortion. The establishment of a crisis pregnancy agency is the mechanism to do that. We have taken on board the recommendations of the all-party committee on that issue. We have provided £5 million for 2002 for expenditure to assist women in crisis pregnancies, to provide education and other programmes to seek to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to assist women who may have had abortions in England in terms of post-abortion counselling. We are dealing with that in a comprehensive <Col N="1240" /> manner. Those issues were raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes made a number of points. I have difficulty with some of them, including the point that the Oireachtas should have a role in deciding when the life of the mother should be saved via medical procedures. He wants the Oireachtas to have a role in terms of what medical procedures may be entered into by medical practitioners to save the life of a mother in the event of a real and substantial risk to her life. I disagree with the idea that such a significant body of people could have that type of specific role. That is wrong and entirely inappropriate. We cannot have the Oireachtas second guessing the type of actions and interventions medical doctors must make in such situations on a daily or weekly basis. It is an untenable point. We are not handing it over to the Medical Council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I moved on to this amendment deliberately to allow other Deputies to speak because I want the <Col N="1241" /> record to show that Deputies, who have spoken on Report Stage, cannot get back in. I understand Deputies McManus, Barnes, Owen, Fitzgerald and Timmins may wish to speak, so I will be brief to give everyone an opportunity because the debate will be guillotined in 25 minutes.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to rename the Bill by inserting &ldquo;and Other Provisions&rdquo;. The reason I tabled it is to draw the public's attention to the fact that it is not only about the protection of human life in pregnancy, but about reintroducing the criminal offence of abortion. It would not be as specified in the 1861 Act, namely, to assist in procuring a miscarriage, but would be the destruction of unborn human life after implantation. There are also a number of other provisions. I do not intend to spend a long time discussing this point because I did so on Committee Stage. The Minister will have the power to designate approved places where these terminations, which are not called abortions, can take place. There is the definition of what is a medical practitioner, which the Minister had to define and redefine between Committee and Report Stages. There is also a reasonable opinion being formed in good faith by a doctor and a definition of a woman. One provision about which I am dissatisfied, although the Minister introduced amendments to meet my concerns, is that the Minister will have power by order in the future to vary the effect of a constitutional amendment. I have serious misgivings about that and I have included safeguards in the amendments I tabled.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister is anxious to respond to the debate, I ask him to address one of my amendments. In the definition section, the other provisions to which I referred, there is no definition as to when life begins. I tabled an amendment to ask the Minister to deal with that. The unborn should be defined as human life which begins at conception. Perhaps when the Minister responds he could tell us if he is prepared to accept that amendment and include it in the definition section. Many people outside the House will be interested to hear that, since this will be read with Article 40.3.3º, the unborn is not defined. Since the Minister is including implantation, perhaps it would not be any harm if a definition of the unborn was included in the definition section. If the Minister is not prepared to do that, will he tell the House why? If the Minister does not answer that question, it will show on the record and the people will make their own deductions. It is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it. I will not delay the House because other Deputies want to speak. I want a specific reference to that in the Minister's reply. It will be important to many people if and when they consider the Bill in a referendum.</P>

      <P>As we are concerned about the record of the House, I want to put something clearly on it. During the debate on the previous amendment Deputy Shatter referred to section 6 <Col N="1242" /> and said we were, in effect, giving a legal and constitutional amnesty to anybody who committed an abortion and was being prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, as and from the moment this Bill is signed into law. Section 21(1)(<i>d</i>) of the Interpretation Act, 1937, which is still law, provides that where an Act of the Oireachtas repeals the whole or a portion of a previous statute, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal shall not:</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of an offence against or contravention of the statute or portion of a statute so repealed which was committed before such repeal, or</P>
      <P>Section 21(1)(<i>e</i>) states that where an Act of the Oireachtas repeals the whole or a portion of a previous statute, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal shall not:</P>
      <P>prejudice or affect any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, pending at the time of such repeal in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, offence, or contravention as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>Section 21(2) makes the principle crystal clear.</P>

      <P>I wonder if I can have the Minister of State's permission to address the House on an issue which does not relate to those of the male gender, but has direct relevance to females whose lives are threatened by this Government's proposal. I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell on those grounds.</P>
      <P>Far from legislating for the protection of human life in pregnancy, the central purpose of this Bill is to ensure there is a withdrawal of the protection of life of suicidal women during pregnancy. The Taoiseach gave a misleading impression to the House when he quoted Dr. Ken Whitaker, chairman of the expert review committee on the Constitution. Dr. Whitaker in his role as chairman of that committee and in his personal testimony indicated very clearly that he did not support the constitutional referendum as a way of dealing with this very difficult and complex issue. He put forward a set of proposals for legislation that would deal with the difficult issues and provide for the cases of suicidal women. He felt absolutely confident that this could be done. He said that if a referendum is decided, the wording will need the most careful consideration. There should be as few adjectives and adverbs as possible because their meaning is arguable. &ldquo;Induced&rdquo;, &ldquo;indirect&rdquo;, and &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; are examples. I have looked at the very complex Bill that has been put forward by the Government and have found, at random, other adjectives that could cause similar problems, for example, &ldquo;in particular&rdquo;, &ldquo;intended&rdquo;, &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, &ldquo;medical&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;reasonable opinion&rdquo;. The advice of Dr. Whitaker has been totally ignored by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was also misleading in his statement this morning when he seemed to think, <Col N="1244" /> wrongly, that allowing mental illness or mental conditions to be considered where there was a risk to the life of the mother would automatically open the floodgates to easy availability of abortions. There are two examples very close to home which he needs to consider in that regard. Here in the Republic of Ireland the right of a suicidal woman whose life is at risk, to have an abortion, has been enshrined in the Constitution since 1992 and there has been no opening of the floodgates. The other example is that of Northern Ireland where abortions are carried out in those circumstances and where no floodgates have opened either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the few minutes I am allowed due to the time constraints to acknowledge the travesty of this morning's proceedings and the guillotining of Committee Stage. I also take the opportunity to point out the repetition of mistakes we have made since 1983 and which we will continue to make.</P>
      <P>Mark my words, this legislation will come back to haunt us. As legislators we will be even less able to do anything about it because of the way we are being marginalised and sidelined. We will not be allowed to amend the legislation as the need arises due to Supreme Court interpretations or scientific progress which we cannot even begin to anticipate. We cannot separate one from the other. Arising from the Supreme Court's interpretation of the law in the tragic X case of 1992, the only objective of this legislation and the proposed constitutional amendment is to stop a suicide threat to the life of the mother during pregnancy being grounds for an abortion. The Bill raises huge problems with regard to cases in the future which follow the pattern in the C case. The C case was decided on the risk of suicide by a young girl who was in the care of a health board. The health board was an agency which was allowed to assist her to travel to terminate her pregnancy.</P>
      <P>If this proposal is passed and suicide is ruled out as a threat to the life of a pregnant woman, the basis for the C case decision is removed and a young woman in that position could not be assisted to travel abroad. This Bill provides that a person will have the right to travel abroad, but if that is challenged it will be found that an agency does not have the right. The consequences of that are very serious. The tragic circumstances in which such a challenge will be made will plunge this country back into the shaming and  embarrassing  marginalising of women that was the result of the 1983 referendum. It is appalling that in 2001 there are so few women Members of this House and the Seanad to speak on behalf of the women on which this legislation will directly impose. I am depressed that in 2001 the status, power and authority of women in their most intimate and fundamental right to be mothers and nurturers is once again being distrusted, legislated on and criminalised.</P>

      <P>I would have more admiration for the Minister if he said what is involved in the legislation. That is why Deputy Mitchell's amendment is so important. This is not just about the protection of human life but also about many other matters. It is flawed in that Article 40.3.4 which the Minister proposes to insert does not restate the equal right to life of the mother which is stated in the preceding subsection. I do not care how much harmonious interpretation the Minister, whose words they are, believes there will be of these subsections being inserted in the Constitution. He has created a legal quagmire.</P>
      <P>Article 15.2 gives the Oireachtas the sole right to pass legislation. The Minister is taking that away from us in the sense that we do not have a choice in the type of legislation we can pass in this instance. He should tell the people that, even if the amendment is passed, there is no obligation on the Oireachtas to pass the legislation. It is like quicksilver &ndash; now you see it, now you do not. The Minister should be honest with the people and say this may not give those who want this referendum what they want because the Oireachtas may not pass the legislation, in which event the amendment will fall.</P>
      <P>It is not I who say the Minister is not trying to do what is right but is trying to achieve consensus. That is what he said in his speech. He said we have considered ways not of doing the right thing but of moving forward in a way which can command the respect and support of the people. The less said about what the Progressive Democrats have done in this the better, especially given that they have abandoned women in this way despite having a woman leader and a woman Minister. They are not concerned about whether this is the right thing. They just say it reaches out to the consensus of the middle ground and has the capacity to garner the support of reasonably minded people. It is not a case of reaching out to ensure they do the right thing by pregnant women who might be suicidal or who do not want their pregnancies.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a harmonious interpretation of this part of the Constitution, what will a judge make of Article 40.3.2 which states: &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done [such as a girl who is made pregnant through rape and is suicidal] vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;, when the next two sections state that this cannot be done in the case of a woman or girl being allowed to have an abortion if she is suicidal because the right has been removed in this instance? The Minister by his actions will be the author of a situation no one argued for or demanded. This is what happened in 1983. On his head be it if he puts this amendment to the people because he is not being honest with them as to its intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a disgrace for a constitutional lawyer to sit beside the Minister and not argue with him as we do. He is small-minded and mean if he does not <Col N="1246" /> tell the Minister that this will be interpreted in a manner which is wrong.</P>

      <P>I agree with colleagues who said it is disgraceful the manner in which the Government is handling this. The Taoiseach's fine words this morning are contradicted by the way the Government has handled this legislation, by guillotining it on Committee Stage and in the House today. I understand why the Government does this, because this is legislation of which it should be ashamed because it is anti-woman, insensitive, hypocritical and politically driven. There is no doubt it reduces protection for women in Ireland. I wish we had time to debate it in more detail so that the message could get out more clearly, and I hope it does in coming weeks. I also hope women and their partners, husbands or boyfriends will see the legislation for what it is. It is anti-woman and distinguishes between mental and physical health. It reduces the protection women have in Ireland, especially if they are suicidal. The Government is using a most extraordinary mechanism which has never been used before to do this.</P>
      <P>The Minister said things on Committee Stage which amounted to an admittance that he did not have the courage to bring legislation to the House and open it up to proper discussion and give it the necessary time for that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise another aspect of this with the Minister and I mentioned this on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach said this morning that the choice is between this referendum or abortion on demand. That is ridiculous. No one is talking about abortion on demand. We are talking about detailed legislation and trying to deal with a difficult situation where everyone wants to see a reduction in the numbers of women having abortions. The legislation does not deal with those women. It says they are repugnant to the Constitution. That is the message the Government is giving the 7,000 women who travelled to England this year for an abortion. They are criminalised in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Members queried the 12 year jail sentence and the Minister answered that on Committee Stage by saying it was already in the old <Col N="1247" /> legislation. That is not the point. He is bringing in what he calls new, modern and appropriate legislation to deal with a social issue and yet women are being criminalised with 12 years as the sentence. That is no way to deal with an issue such as this. The Constitution is no place to deal with it either. Almost no country in the world deals with this issue in a constitution. That is not the place to deal with it because it is much too complex. We do not have any idea what type of case law this will give rise to.</P>
    <P>A number of Members said there is a contradiction between Article 40.3.3 and Article 40.3.4, that they are different and will be interpreted as such. The Minister said that, when read together, they will be seen as harmonious. In fact, there is a significant difference in the definitions of unborn and in the protection of women in both subsections. They are contradictory and I have no doubt that, when they go before the Supreme Court, that will be seen.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another issue relating to mental health. Why will we be the only country in the European Union where women's mental health will not be protected? I quoted the statistics and information from the Green Paper on this. Every other country takes account of women's mental health in its legislation and we are doing the exact opposite. Why should we do that? What is reasonable or middle ground about excluding women's mental health as a consideration? How can any right-minded person say mental health can be excluded and say it is reasonable and middle ground and that the whole person or the whole situation or psychological trauma a woman may face is being taken into account?</P>
    <P>What about the different countries? Does Austria protect the mental health of women in pregnancy where there is felt to be a risk to her life? The answer is yes. Does Belgium? The answer is yes. Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Northern Ireland and Sweden also preserve women's mental health. What is so different about Irish women? The United Kingdom does so in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. What is so different about the mental health of Irish women from that of their EU counterparts that it should be dealt with in this extraordinary, super-constitutional way? Why is this differentiation being included? What is reasonable and middle ground about excluding mental health? I asked on Committee Stage what a reasonable mother or father would want for their 14 year old child if she were pregnant as a result of rape or incest and were suicidal. Does the Minister think they would want to consider a variety of options for her without being criminalised by the Constitution? I believe they would.</P>
    <P>In the C case there was a nexus between the determination on mental health and the right to travel. That is gone.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Handbook was published in October 1998. Two amendments to the handbook were published in November 1999. Incorporation of a further amendment approved last year in relation to statute law restatement will follow the enactment of the relevant legislation. An Irish language version of the handbook was published in May 2001. There are no further plans to amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government intends to continue having meetings outside Dublin from time to time. So far meetings have been held in Ballaghaderreen, <Col N="1255" /> County Roscommon, Knocknaheeney, County Cork, Faithlegg, County Waterford, Ballymascanlon, County Louth and Killarney, County Kerry. However, there are no further meetings planned at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the handbook, as it currently stands, does not give any advice to Ministers using the advertising budgets of their Departments for their personal self-promotion? In the light of recent sets of advertisements that featured the Minister for Finance strolling down the banks of the Grand Canal, or indeed&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the handbook which gives guidance to Cabinet Ministers as to how they should behave. It appears that it does not give any guidance in respect of the hijack of departmental advertising budgets for personal promotion. To assist the Taoiseach, and before you intervened, Sir, I was describing the three or four examples&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have an orderly Question Time, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I will comply with your rulings if I am not continually interrupted. I prefaced my remarks&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was looking for, but I will start again, in order I trust. Since the Cabinet Handbook does not provide guidelines on what I perceive to be a new development, although that may not be the case but I cannot recall it in the past, will the Taoiseach consider it desirable from everybody's point of view that departmental budgets for legitimate advertising purposes are <Col N="1256" /> not personalised in a way where people who would be candidates for election within six months from now are given high profile, personalised positions in terms of newspaper, radio and television advertisements?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, that is not in the Cabinet handbook, but I recall similar arguments being made in the past about the issue. I think the Deputy would like me to examine precedents and practices in this regard, and I will gladly do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet Handbook sets out the guidelines for appropriate behaviour for office holders. Some of the guidelines are incorporated in law, others are on a more informal basis. In view of the fact that there is widespread concern, which continues, about revelations at tribunals, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that he would accept a donation from a key witness at a tribunal at a recent fund-raising event? Does he believe that the Cabinet Handbook should be amended to take into account that particular practice if he deems it inappropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The handbook contains detailed and clear guidelines on ethics in public office and the 1995 Act with which office holders have to comply. I have not taken money from anybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to answer the question, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because it is the only way of addressing these matters, unless one goes to litigation which, as I found out on the last occasion, is rather costly because one cannot get one's money back. It is better to do it here.</P>

      <P>Not a penny. Headlines are written to the effect that one got the money, but one never gets the money and has to pay the fees. That is how the old game works.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach examines the situation to which my first question referred he will find that a considerable amount of money was expended in replying to parliamentary questions. To avoid further abuse &ndash; I regard it as an abuse &ndash; and for everybody's interest in the run-up to a general election, the Taoiseach should take the view that departmental advertisements should not be availed of by office holders who will be candidates in forthcoming elections. The Taoiseach knows what I am referring to, and it would be advisable from the point of view of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For years I have taken the view that one is better off when there are rules because it is safer for everybody. It is like everything else in life. If there are rules, we might not always comply with them, but we should try to live by them as best we can. I am not saying I accept there has been an abuse, but neither am I that familiar with the practice. I can remember similar arguments. I will certainly look at the issue, but there is a protection in having rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that while some business is conducted in Cabinet meetings held outside Dublin, they are usually used for public relations purposes? Will he indicate if Cabinet meetings outside Dublin are scheduled to take place between now and the general election and, if so, will he ensure they are purely business meetings and not further public relations initiatives at the taxpayers' expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that Cabinet meetings held outside Dublin are public relations initiatives. During the Cabinet meetings held at Ballaghaderreen and Faithlegg, the entire Cabinet met the southern, eastern and BMW regional bodies. We had working meetings with those bodies and held conferences on what would happen in regard to setting up their structures. The Cabinet meeting in Ballymascanlon, County Louth was held at a time when Ballymascanlon had been hit hard by foot and mouth disease, lost its entire tourist season and was coming to a period when it thought it could move on. We thought the meeting would help the county and, similarly, Killarney. There is no harm in having meetings outside Dublin. In many ways it is good for members of a Cabinet to see what is outside the Pale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the origin and status of a document issued from his Department on 5 October 2001 entitled, Briefing Note on Labour Claims About Maastricht; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The briefing note to which the Deputy refers was drafted by my political advisers. Its purpose was for use by the Government press secretary in response to questions arising from the release to the political correspondents of a letter which had been sent by me in reply to the leader of the Labour Party's questions concerning certain constitutional aspects of the proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to the right to life of the unborn.</P>
      <P>When the note was brought to my attention by the Government press secretary, I instructed him that, when briefing the political correspondents, he should only use the three central paragraphs that rebutted the points raised by the Deputy in his letter and to omit the comment which was also provided. He carried out this instruction to the letter as was evidenced by the articles published in the following morning's newspapers which only made reference to the said paragraphs.</P>
      <P>However, later that evening, in response to a request from a political reporter with the RTE radio programme, &ldquo;This Week&rdquo;, for a copy of my letter to Deputy Quinn, a member of staff in the Government press office inadvertently faxed a copy of the note to the journalist along with the other material he had requested. The document was not otherwise issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Taoiseach's statement, does he agree there is a need to ensure that a clear division exists between the necessary and legitimate functions of a Government press <Col N="1259" /> office staffed by civil servants and the understandable and inevitable role of political advisers who will put a political spin, in terms of defence or attack, on comments emanating from the Fianna Fáil Taoiseach or the Progressive Democrats Tánaiste? Unfortunately, that was not the case in this instance but it allows us to avoid the politicisation of our professional and impartial Civil Service, which I know the Taoiseach agrees would be undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach previously confirmed that the cost was £274,000 but that other bills were outstanding. Could he explain the high cost of the air taxis which were hired for internal travel? What was the justification for using £190,000 for the hire of private aeroplanes rather than scheduled flights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the cost of air taxis is high. However, this involved the cost of arranging it. It was not possible within the six days of the visit to take in the two countries, including visits to Brasilia, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, without taking internal flights. It would have been impossible to complete the programme using scheduled flights. The air taxi was, therefore, essential. Not only would I not have been able to take in the two capitals, but I could not have visited the other cities. The advice, therefore, was to use air taxis, which we did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his original reply the Taoiseach stated that 16 people were on the trip. He mentioned two people from protocol who were sent to Brazil in advance because we do not have an embassy in the country. Are these two persons additional to the 16 and to which Department are they attached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to correction, I believe the people who travelled in the advance party of four were a person from my Department, one from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Campbell who travelled from Rome and linked up with us and an official who travelled from Mexico.</P>

In the normal course of events, however, I travel with one security officer.</P>

      <P>I emphasise I do not quibble with official visits abroad; I favour them. However, the figure of over £300,000 appears appallingly large. Does the Taoiseach, in retrospect, consider this amount of money justified in terms of benefits gained from the visit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It was justified in terms of the opportunities it provided for the people travelling with me, including senior people from Enterprise Ireland, and the opportunity to visit projects in which the ODA programme invests money. It is a pity air taxis are so costly. The alternative, however, is to spend much more time abroad. I tend to take the view that when abroad I should always try to do as much as possible in as short a period as possible. On this occasion this necessitated hiring an air taxi. The Deputies know I have no objection to hauling through airports if that option is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Council established under the Good Friday Agreement held its second summit meeting in Dublin Castle on Friday, 30 November 2001. Together with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and other members of the Government, I was very pleased to welcome Prime Minister Tony Blair, and representatives of the devolved administrations, including Mr. Jack McConnell, First Minister, Scottish Executive, Rhodri Morgan, First Minister, National Assembly for Wales, and David Trimble, First Minister and Mark Durkan, Deputy First Minister, Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
      <P>The Isle of Man was represented by Mr. Donald Gelling, Chief Minister of the Isle of Man Government. Jersey was represented by Senator Pierre Horsfall, President of the States of Jersey policy and resources committee, while Guernsey was represented by Deputy Laurie Morgan, President, States of Guernsey advisory and finance committee.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the meeting was the issue of drug misuse and how co-operation in this area might be developed within the council. The council agreed elements for a framework for future co-operation and established a group of senior officials to advance work in the agreed areas. Following the discussion on drugs, the council was updated on work being undertaken in sectoral areas including the environment, social inclusion, transport, the knowledge economy and tourism and health by the relevant lead administrations.</P>
      <P>Jersey, with the BIC secretariat, has also taken the lead in designing the BIC website, in consultation with the administrations of other members. In the first instance, the aim is to create a public site as a showcase for the work of the British-Irish Council. The aim is to launch the public site in spring 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next summit level meeting will be hosted by Jersey in April 2002, and that meeting will <Col N="1263" /> focus on the issue of the knowledge economy. Scotland and Wales will host a summit in September 2002. Northern Ireland will host a summit in early 2003.</P>
    <P>The third plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council was held on the afternoon of Friday, 30 November 2001. With the Tánaiste and other members of the Government, I was pleased to welcome the Northern Ireland Executive delegation led by Mr. David Trimble, First Minister and Mr. Mark Durkan, Deputy First Minister. The Council expressed its satisfaction at recent positive developments in regard to the implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Council received a progress report on work done by the working group on the establishment of an independent North-South consultative forum and agreed that further discussion take place at the forthcoming institutional format meeting with a further progress report to be made at the next plenary.</P>
    <P>The Council also received a report from the consultants engaged to carry out the study on obstacles to cross-Border mobility on the island of Ireland. The report will be published shortly to allow interested organisations, including Departments and individuals, the opportunity to present their views on the recommendations and their implementation.</P>
    <P>The Council received a report on enhancing competitiveness in the two economies which was commissioned by the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, working in conjunction with InterTradeIreland, the trade and business development body. The Council requested that the relevant Departments and agencies pursue the competitiveness agenda, to mutual economic benefit, in the areas for which they have a key responsibility.</P>
    <P>There was also a discussion of the effect on the economies of both jurisdictions of the horrific events of 11 September. The Council agreed that their aftermath poses significant challenges for the economies of both jurisdictions. The Council considered how the tourism agencies on the island of Ireland are developing proposals to reduce the impact on tourism.</P>
    <P>The Council considered and approved a schedule of NSMC meetings to take place over the coming months. It is planned that the Council will hold a first meeting in institutional format before the end of December. The Council also agreed that its next meeting in plenary format would be in Northern Ireland in May 2002.</P>
    <P>Copies of the communiqués that issued after the meetings of the BIC and the North-South Ministerial Council have been placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>Both plenary meetings proved extremely successful and highlighted the useful work being done by the institutions established under the <Col N="1264" /> Good Friday Agreement. They provide a useful forum for discussing matters of real practical interest and importance. The occasions demonstrate, yet again, that there is a great deal of normal business that needs to be discussed both between North and South and between the representatives of these islands generally. Our meetings clearly demonstrated that we can do this in a constructive and co-operative way which serves the interests of all the people we represent.</P>
    <P>In the course of a bi-lateral meeting, I discussed a number of issues with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair. In particular, I expressed grave concern about Sellafield and the British Government's decision to go ahead with the MOX plant.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of co-operation by the British authorities with the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. We also had an opportunity, briefly, to discuss the forthcoming European Council meeting at Laeken as well as the ongoing situation in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Ulster Unionist Council to back Mr. David Trimble's leadership strategy and I congratulate him on the outcome achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, met the Secretary of State, Dr. Reid, MP, on 3 December and discussed a number of current issues. They also met General John de Chastelain. General de Chastelain confirmed that he and his colleagues remain fully engaged in carrying out their mandate and achieving further progress in the process of putting paramilitary arms, both loyalist and republican, completely beyond use. I met Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams on 3 December and we discussed recent developments.</P>
    <P>I hope we can look forward to a period of sustained stability where the institutions and the processes of the Agreement can be allowed to work. I very much welcome the progress that has been made in securing a resolution of the Holy Cross school issue in Ardoyne. The work of the Executive and particularly the direct engagement of the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Mark Durkan, demonstrates the type of progress that can be made by the parties working closely together in tackling the many challenges they face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of questions which have been answered together and many issues to which the Taoiseach replied. Will the Taoiseach confirm, first and foremost, that the copies of the communiqués are available in the Library and can be accessed by Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In raising the issue of Sellafield with the British Government, has the Prime Minister Mr. Blair referred, as his Secretary of State for energy, Margaret Beckett, MP, has, to the substantial amount of capital investment which has already been put into the facility by the British Government and the economic dominance in the region of Cumbria which Sellafield represents for the <Col N="1265" /> 16,000 people directly or indirectly employed by the facility? If he has referred to this economic dimension, leaving aside the hazardous nature of the activity and its pollutant effect upon the Irish Sea, has the Government thought of sharing the financial burden associated with getting beyond the present situation in Sellafield? Has the Government considered on the one hand, helping the British Government to overcome what it would perceive as financial loss for money spent which cannot be retrieved and, on the other hand, coming perhaps jointly to the Commission in Brussels looking for some special kind of package for alternative forms of employment in the region of Cumbria to facilitate a move away from this environmentally dangerous activity at Sellafield to other forms of economic activity which will secure the economic base of the region of Cumbria? Has this matter been raised by the Taoiseach or by the British Prime Minister or is it possible to get beyond the confrontation which has characterised exchanges between the British and Irish Governments for probably the past 15 to 20 years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the economic consequences of the entire development. Many of the recent discussions have been about the MOX plant but, as the Deputy said, certainly over the past 17 or 18 years the discussions have been about the overall development. I know that Sellafield provides a huge economic input to Cumbria and I have acknowledged that on many occasions. We must be honest and frank about it. If anybody was asked to shed 15,000 or 16,000 full-time jobs and 3,000 or 4,000 part-time jobs, it would be an enormous undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I do not think the British Government will do that in the short term. While that clearly constitutes an enormous part of its position and that is why there is such strong support for it in Cumbria, regardless of what its own health and safety people, the local authorities and politicians and other experts have said over the years, it will stick with it. Why does it do that? It does it because of its economic significance to them. I do not agree with that but I understand it and I think most people here do.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the other argument applies, particularly in the case of the MOX plant, that according to its own examination there is no justification, economic or otherwise, for it. The MOX plant will effectively perpetuate the nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield and it will continue for another generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was to be turned around, there would be this enormous capital investment which clearly will have to be written off. The Prime Minister Mr. Blair did not confirm that to me but, according to everything I see and study, that is the only way it can be handled. The plant only has 11% <Col N="1266" /> capacity. There is no case being argued that it can go much better than that.</P>
    <P>The German Chancellor, Mr. Gerhard Schröeder has outlined where he is going, which is a different place than that to which his predecessors were going, and I think he is very determined on that. I have spoken to him and listened to what he has said publicly about that matter. France is in a different category and it is not as clear where it is going. Japan has stated that it will not get into this position. Therefore, if one just confines the arguments to the MOX plant issue, our view, which has been put forward by all our experts for years, is that any perceived economic benefits associated with the Sellafield plant such as the employment it creates are greatly outweighed by the serious environment issues, and I have had that discussion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have said previously that the Prime Minister Mr. Blair, who no doubt understands our concern, would probably feel that we overstate the fact that there will be an increase in radioactive discharges to the marine and terrestrial environments due to the volume of the international shipments, including shipments in the Irish Sea. I think he would accept that and all of our other arguments, but he probably would argue that we overstate them. The British Government puts a huge emphasis on its support for BNFL and because of its investment it is not interested in changing its mind.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, although we did not get all we wanted the other day, it has given us an opportunity to engage in these arguments. That is one of the benefits. For all of my political life &ndash; and I am sure long before that &ndash; the British Government has always stood behind BNFL. No matter what we said it would simply stand back and say that was its position. At least this gives us a chance to discuss some of these issues. There are many other countries, as well as ourselves, which are fairly united on the issue. It was interesting to hear David Trimble's strong opinions on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He was representing the views of the Assembly. Some of our SDLP colleagues in County Down, including Eddie McGrady, were probably among the first people to speak on the issue approximately 15 years ago. These are issues that need to be discussed. I would be misleading the House if I said it would be easy. Minds are very closed on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not raised the question of financial assistance from us but on several occasions I have tried, because it has been highlighted to me by the Department, to discuss with <Col N="1267" /> them the economic realities of the issue. I did not say we would contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>During his discussions with the British Prime Minister, what answer was obtained by the Taoiseach with regard to the security measures being implemented, or to be implemented, due to the heightened threat of terrorist activity following the atrocities of 11 September? Ireland and the UK may need to consider certain financial arrangements as a follow-up to any closure at Sellafield, but did the Taoiseach introduce alternative proposals about life after Sellafield in Cumbria? With regard to employment, Sellafield could perhaps be converted into a nuclear clean-up facility and other kinds of employment might also be possible in that event.

      <P>Has the Taoiseach discussed with representatives of other countries the possibility of Ireland giving a lead in bringing together countries where there is equal concern about the issue? As far away as Chile, South Africa, New Zealand, South Korea and Panama people want to see an end to nuclear transportation and thereby to reprocessing. Will he take a lead in that development? Some Nordic countries have been part of arrangements concerning OSPAR. Will he take that diplomatic work further afield and build the international links needed to make progress on this matter?</P>

Its view is that after investing so much money its commitment should be unwavering. It sticks to the line that it has done everything it can.

        <b>: </b>The Taoiseach said the economic costs of implementing the wishes of most people on this island with regard to the closure of Sellafield and the cancellation of plans for the MOX plants had been stressed to him. The economic costs of closing and converting pale into insignificance compared to the cost of continuing with this plant in the event of the following: the continuing environmental pollution of the Irish Sea; the possibility of an accident such as that at Chernobyl which would be catastrophic in its costs; or the effects of an attack on or sabotage of the plant. Does the Taoiseach agree that the case should be pressed from that point of view in the knowledge that the British Prime Minister may be quite hypocritical on the issue? It is only a week since his Chancellor of the Exchequer voted about £100 million extra to drop bombs in Afghanistan, something not previewed two months ago. Will the Taoiseach bring these points home? It is not a question of thousands of workers losing their jobs, but of providing alternative employment for them. It is time that the polite exchanges gave way to a vigorous and robust attack on the unsustainable position of the British. Will the Taoiseach appeal to ordinary people in Britain and elsewhere who support the view of the majority of the Irish people in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The view of our legal team is that it could halt it if we pursue that line. Deputy Quinn asked about a joint approach. The tribunal is clearly trying to get us to engage together to open up that opportunity. We welcome this because these were issues we could never get at. There is an opportunity to deal with the problem. We know the stated position. While the storage of this waste and liquid in tanks in Sellafield poses an enormous risk, we want to see it solidi<Col N="1270" /> fied for safer storage. BNFL is looking at doing things after 2015 and 2018 and it is the same with the British Government's position on the old Magnox reactors which it wants to phase out between now and 2018. I am not saying that they will not do so, but we will engage with them and try to find a way of putting the case to Europe. There have been other cases which have been helped out and other industries have moved on, for example, the steel industry in Germany.</P>
      <P>On the issue raised by Deputy Higgins, the gloves have long been off. That is the reason we are in Hamburg with the OSPAR Convention and are looking at the EURATOM treaty. We now have to take the legal route. Tough statements have been made in the last 15 years and our stated legal position is on record. Perhaps more could have been done during the years. There is now a realisation in relation to the OSPAR Convention and the European Union that this is a real issue which is getting more attention. While we may not have won everything at Hamburg, our case has been well put and we must keep on with the process and continue using the legal mechanisms available to us. Otherwise the issue will continue with people shouting at each other and getting nowhere.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the action he intends to take to address the criticisms of his Department and the health board system contained in a report (details supplied).</Quest>
      <QRef>[31009/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place the report referred to by the Deputy is a very substantial document and the most comprehensive report on value for money in the health services ever published by the Department of Health and Children. In keeping with its programme of reform of the health services, the Government decided, as part of the action programme for the millennium, that consultants should carry out a VFM audit of the health service. The consultants, working with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, began work last year. This involved intensive consultation with health boards, voluntary hospitals, staff organisations, etc.</P>
      <P>The work of the consultants informed the consideration given to the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You. It was seen as one of the key documents supporting the work on the strategy together with the primary care model and the review of bed capacity. The Government, when deciding on the publication of the new health strategy, also decided that these other reports should be published in order that a full picture of the key strategic issues would be available to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> The consultants acknowledged that there had been progress in many aspects of the health services during the 1990s. In summary, these were: in defining health needs and formulating the relevant strategies and actions necessary to meet those needs; the numbers treated in acute hospitals have significantly increased; significant additional investment has been made in recent years in services for older people, in child care and for the intellectually disabled, among others; policy development has been strong, with well developed strategies in areas such as cancer, cardiac services and children; the introduction of service planning in the health sector is also a positive development.</P>
    <P>The following summarises the areas commented on by the report and the action to be taken in the context of the implementation of the new health strategy: an independent health information and quality authority will be established in 2002. It is expected that a report on the national health information strategy will be completed in January. Under the new strategy a review of the role and structures of the Department of Health and Children and an independent audit of functions and structures in the health system will be carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>In response to the points made in the VFM study regarding requirements concerning hospital policy the strategy contains a commitment to establish a national hospitals' agency to do the following: prepare a strategic plan for hospital capacity expansion; advise on the organisation and development of all acute hospital services; advise on the designation of national specialist services and development of designated services; develop a strategic relationship with the private hospital sector; co-ordinate actions to reduce waiting lists; and liaise with regulatory and professional bodies. Following a detailed assessment, the health strategy has commented that &ldquo;the present centrally funded tax-based system of funding, complemented as at present by private health insurance will be retained.&rdquo;  In addition, there will also be a review of the allocation process for health boards.</P>
    <P>The need for a full policy framework has been comprehensively addressed by the health strategy which has been acknowledged as a wide ranging document which has set down policy for all the major programmes in the health area. The role of the office of health management will be expanded to meet the objectives of the strategy for organisation development and, with the health board executive, HeBE, will address the needs for improved co-ordination of actions as identified in the VFM report.</P>
    <P>Priority will be given to health promotion and preventive measures. The health strategy and the primary care report, A New Direction, set out a comprehensive programme of action in regard to health promotion and preventive measures based <Col N="1272" /> firmly on the concept that primary care should be at the centre of future developments with particular emphasis on the prevention of illness and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle.</P>
    <P>There are many other recommendations in the VFM report which have been taken on board by the health strategy and other reports such as the primary care report and the continuing work on the national health information strategy. The VFM report has, with the other publications described above, created a positive framework for change which will be acted upon to ensure a quality and cost effective service for the next decade. When I launched the new health strategy last week I made it clear that I would be publishing the value for money report. Given the above facts, it should be clear to any fair minded observer that the entire process has been marked by openness. Any suggestion that the VFM report was carried out in anything other than a very open and transparent manner is entirely mischievous. The Government's intention to commission the report was widely known, the process of the work was wide-ranging both at national and local level and its importance as a crucial part of the overall consideration of the health strategy was underlined by the Government's decision to publish it with the other strategy documents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on value for money was commissioned by the Government and not by the Minister for Health and Children because the Government, in particular the Minister for Finance, could not tolerate any longer the indecisiveness of the Minister for Health and Children who was pouring more and more money into a black hole and not getting value for taxpayer's money? It is a fact that the House has given the Minister unprecedented amounts of taxpayer's money to provide a proper health service which he has not had the competence to deliver. Is that right? That is the real finding of the value for money audit carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche. I repeat that the Minister did not commission that report, that it was commissioned by the Ministers around him who are fed up with his performance in his determination to leave the Department to his successor in the same state as he left the Department of Education and Science &ndash; a management shambles where he would not let the civil servants do the job they wanted because of his constant interference for popularity and PR purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is inaccurate and incorrect. The commitment to a value for money audit was given as part of the action programme for the millennium in November 1999 before I became Minister for Health and Children. We can take it from that fact that everything the Deputy has said is erroneous and without foundation. That also applies to his comments on my term in the Department of Education and Science <Col N="1273" /> which I leave it to others, particularly those in the educational community, to judge.</P>
      <P>The value for money audit was necessary and the Department of Health and Children, with the Department of Finance, engaged in it honestly and transparently. Many recommendations emerged, but the critical analysis which was part of the process will inform better practice and enhance service delivery. The audit also praises and compliments many worthy initiatives, strategies and significant improvements in service in recent years, particularly for older people and those with disabilities. The audit is a three volume document which deserves considered analysis, not knee-jerk reaction. In time, it will be seen not only as the document that informed the process leading to the publication of the health strategy but also wider considerations of the structures of the health service and the methods of delivering services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The report stated that medical cards were good value for money.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has a very strict regulatory regime which is designed to ensure that only competent, properly qualified medical practitioners can work in this country. No doctor is allowed to practise medicine in Ireland unless he or she is registered on the register of medical practitioners. The overriding rationale behind these requirements is to ensure the protection of the public. Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Irish Medical Council is the independent body charged with regulating medical registration.</P>
      <P>When this issue surrounding the appointment in 2000 of a locum consultant psychiatrist by the South-Eastern Health Board was brought to my attention, I immediately made arrangements to meet with both the Medical Council and the board. I was unable to meet the South-Eastern Health Board due to other commitments, but following the briefing of my officials by the board and my meeting with the Medical Council, I decided to appoint an independent person, Ms Maureen Lynott, to review the circumstances surrounding the case and to ascertain all the facts with a view to establishing whether and how procedures or regulations may be improved.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has informed me that it employed the named doctor in a locum capacity from 17 April 2000 until 5 November 2000. He was employed at St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital, Clonmel, until 31 July and from 14 August at St. Canice's Psychiatric Hospital, Kilkenny. I have been advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that the temporary appointment was made following the board's advertisement of the post and in accordance with its recruitment procedures. The board has established a help line for patients who may have concerns in relation to their contact with this doctor.</P>
      <P>I reassure the House that it is the intention of my Department, the health board and the Medical Council to ensure the protection of patients and to promote confidence in the health service. We are all taking steps to ensure that these aims are met. In this context, I have been advised that the Medical Council has obtained an order from the High Court suspending the doctor in question from the general register of medical practitioners from 13 November 2001, pending the outcome of an inquiry by the council's fitness to practise committee early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that his statement in regard to the existence of a strict regulatory regime sits uneasily with the facts of this case where someone was appointed to a position here with documentation of certification provided by the Medical Council? Even though the council knew the doctor was under suspension in Britain, it did not inform the health board. The Minister must accept that this matter cannot be left to a lengthy independent review. What provision is he making to establish a procedure to ensure that full information is provided to employers? What is the current procedure? Is the Minister aware of the significant complaints <Col N="1275" /> about delays of fitness to practise hearings? Will he indicate the terms of reference for the independent review? Is the reviewer examining all aspects of fitness to practise hearings and the certification of consultants by the Medical Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The independent reviewer is to consider all relevant written documentation on the recruitment of Dr. John Harding Price by the South-Eastern Health Board from 17 April 2000 to 31 July 2000, and 14 August 2000 to 5 November 2000; to interview all relevant persons about the recruitment and employment of that doctor for the periods mentioned above; to consider how procedures and-or regulations may need to be improved as a result of this examination; and to prepare a report on the matter for me.</P>
      <P>My comment on the strict regulatory procedure applied to the broad area registration of medical practitioners. On the other side of the scale, we have had complaints, some from Members of this House, about the difficulties some practitioners have in getting on the register because of an over-zealous regime. However, incidents like this highlight the need for vigilance.</P>
      <P>In my meeting with the Medical Council, I learned that part of the difficulty was that in August 2000 it went to the High Court to have Dr. Harding Price taken off the register but were refused by the High Court which did not accept that a case was proven. The president of the council told me that it was prohibited by the court from revealing its information to anyone, even the Minister.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the special housing aid scheme for the <Col N="1276" /> elderly is administered by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government which fund it.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for the operation of the scheme are determined by a task force which is chaired by an officer of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. All statistical information on the scheme is collected by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and it has supplied the following information about applications on hand as at 30 June 2001. It has no information on the average length of time a person might wait to get on the waiting list. Eastern Regional Health Authority, 1,801; Midland, 795; Mid-Western, 1,519; North-Eastern, 1,284; North-Western, 637; South-Eastern, 892; Southern, 749; Western, 2,491. This gives a total of 10,168.</P>
      <P>In the interests of elderly persons whose housing conditions are improved under the scheme, it has, since its inception, been administered with flexibility and a minimum of formality. However, over the years health boards have evolved a priority list to ensure that the most urgent cases are dealt with as quickly as possible, within the terms of the guidelines. Typically, aid is available for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant. In 2000, the scheme was extended to include the provision of suitable heating systems where found necessary, to meet the needs of elderly persons.</P>
      <P>The community care departments of the health boards operate the scheme, using various mechanisms to carry out the work, including contractors, FÁS, and a grant-based approach whereby the applicant employs the contractor.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>Health boards have been requested by the task force to use a combination of approaches, with the most suitable being applied as appropriate in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The scheme itself is extremely effective. Between 1982 and the end of 2000 more than 42,000 cases have been dealt with. A further 2,288 jobs have been completed in the period January to June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, an increase of 33% on the same period last year, and 2,360 jobs are under way. An increase of 24% in applications has also been recorded. There has been an unprecedented level of demand for the provision of heating systems since it was introduced in February 2000, with 429 applicants provided with such facilities in the balance of that year and 649 to June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the valuable work being done, funding for the scheme has been increased significantly since 1997, with a provision of £4 million, 5.08 million, in that year raised to £5 million, 6.35 million, in 1998; £6 million, 7.62 million, in 1999; £8 million, 10.16 million, in 2000; £8.65 million, 10.98 million, for 2001. The allocations to the boards are determined by the task force from the funding available and are based, not on <Col N="1277" /> the geographical spread of the population, but on the statistical returns received from the health boards showing the level of activity within the area, the actual number of applications on hands and the estimated cost of these applications.</P>
    <P>In 2001, £8.65 million was allocated to the boards as follows: health board allocation: Eastern £1,280,000, 1.625 million; Midland £920,000, 1.168 million; Mid-Western £1,150,000, 1.460 million; North-Eastern £1,008,000, 1.280 million: North-Western £700,000, 0.889 million; South-Eastern £950,000, 1.206 million; Southern £1,000,000, 1.270 million; Western £1,650,000, 2.095 million.</P>

      <P>Any task force that does not know the average period of time that old people are waiting for these fittings ought to be sacked and any Minister that puts up with a task force like that is not worthy of the name. Is the Minister aware of people like my elderly constituent in Inchicore aged 80 who was admitted to hospital last week because she fell at home, having been waiting and waiting for assessment for a stair rail to enable her to remain independent and safe in her home? Is the Minister aware that there are thousands of people in Dublin alone waiting for up to three years for assessment by an occupational therapist so that they can get rails fitted to the bath or shower or stairs? Does the Minister not consider it an absolute scandal that one of his 78 task forces can inform the Minister in a reply for this House that it does not know the average length of waiting time for a senior citizen in these circumstances? How do they deal with the task, what sort of a force are they and what sort of a Minister is he that he would put up with that reply?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister introduce a scheme whereby senior citizens will be allowed spend up to £3,000 on the certification of a GP and the local community welfare officer in order to get rid of these waiting lists? That would allow people who are aged 80 years to remain in their own homes and not become dependent on State care.</P>

      <P>There is a great variance in waiting times throughout the various health board areas. I am aware that in the Western Health Board area six to eight months is the average. Nearly 5,000 out of 10,000 applications are being completed in any one year. There is a scheme of prioritisation where the health boards can prioritise if there is a difficult case and I can see room for manoeuvre there. We have increased the moneys going to this scheme over the years. In 2001, more than £8.5 million was given to this scheme whereas less than £4 million was provided before we came into office. We have increased the amount of money going into the scheme. We have also introduced a new scheme for heating. We are looking after the needs of the elderly. I would still prefer to see a waiting time of less than three months and I would like the needs of the elderly to be met instantly if possible. We depend <Col N="1278" /> on the health boards personnel to do the job and I have every faith in them.</P>
      <P>With regard to major works we have run into problems finding contractors because of the buoyant economy. The work can be completed either through contract; by FÁS; by way of health board grants. To date there has been great flexibility in regard to how these works were undertaken. Today's Budget Statement may make more money available for these schemes. We have dramatically increased the funding for these schemes over the years. This Government has done more for the elderly than any other Government heretofore.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is no more eloquent argument for the case being put by the Opposition that the 200,000 people who were excluded from medical cards should be included immediately? Would the Minister not accept that his decision to exclude these people and refuse to extend the income limits is an absolute disaster? Would the Minister accept that there has been significant decline in percentage terms in the numbers covered by medical cards? Surely he would agree with me that this shows once and for all that the income limits are totally unreasonable in terms of meeting the needs of people on modest incomes who need to be able to access health care? Would he not accept that during his stewardship and that of his Government there has been a steady decline in the number of people being able to avail of medical card cover? It is also clear that costs have gone up and many people who are working today are being put in an impossible position because their income is above the income limit and yet they are becoming an increasingly large portion of our population who cannot afford to take themselves or their families to the doctor as they are not eligible for a medical card.</P>

      <P>There was no minimum wage under the previous Government. We have introduced and increased it. The extra 300,000 people at work and the economic prosperity of recent years have, of course, reduced the numbers eligible for medical cards. The Government has concentrated on raising the eligibility thresholds for older people, as we promised at the general election. The vast majority suffer a very significant drop in income on retirement. The Opposition has twisted and turned on this issue and made sniping comments.</P>

This was a good decision with the others affecting older people to significantly improve their lives, especially in terms of access to facilities. We have not excluded anybody. We have also made it clear we are committed to widening eligibility in line with a study undertaken under the PPF to expand medical card eligibility to a further 200,000 people. That commitment is given in the strategy.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister now accept that every other list in his Department is going up? The only one coming down is the list of medical cards. The Government is taking them off the poor, the weak and the sick in society. Does that not show it has let them down? Does it not show it has deliberately targeted the weak in society? We listened to the Minister's history lesson earlier. In 1996 the figure was 34.59%; in 1997, 33.64% and now 29%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about the additional 200,000 medical cards from the Independent Deputy from County Kerry. Immediately after Question Time I have an appointment with the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, to collect my 100,000 for people in County Mayo, because the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, has failed. What is happening in relation to medical cards, based on the announcement by Deputy Healy-Rae of an additional 200,000 cards? Where will the Minister get the money to add these 200,000 people to the medical card scheme? Last night I told him where <Col N="1281" /> he could find it. He should get rid of the spin-doctors. Does he know anything about the announcement made by Deputy Healy-Rae? Is he not kept informed of what is happening? Perhaps that is what has gone wrong in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asserts we are targeting poor people, but that is not the case. We are not taking cards off anybody. The only reason eligibility thresholds were exceeded in recent years has been the dramatic and extraordinary increase in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Ring once and expect some degree of courtesy in response. The only thing we have done is to give medical cards to those over 70 years. That was what we said we would do at the election. As a result of a study done for the PPF and the health strategy, we have made it clear we want to widen eligibility to cover another 200,000 people.</P>
      <P>The discretionary medical card system is also in place. What we issue are not ring-fenced regulations; they are guidelines to health boards and chief executive officers. Those on low incomes who need ongoing medication or are suffering from chronic illness can apply for a discretionary card. When we negotiated with the Irish Medical Organisation last year its complaint was there are too many with medical cards. In return, we made funding available to recognise that a significant part of the system entails issuing discretionary medical cards to those on low incomes in regular need of medication because of chronic conditions.</P>
      <P>The budgetary policy of the Government in recent years has been to improve the lot of the less well-off in society. Social welfare payments have increased beyond the rate of inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We introduced the minimum wage and an historic increase in child benefit last year. We have provided far more income through a variety of fiscal and social welfare mechanisms to help those on low incomes. This was considerably more than anything contemplated by the rainbow Government or the parties opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that what he has said does not relate to the facts? Does he accept that during the term of office of the Government the gap between rich and poor has widened enormously? The top 10% now have disposable income 13 times that of the lowest 10%. This has happened during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> In hindsight, whatever about the merit of giving medical cards to those over 70 years, does the Minister accept the deal he struck with doctors was bad value for money? The doctors had him over a barrel which meant, in effect, the costs for providing for this change were considerable compared with the good value for money he would have got by extending the income limits for those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>In 2002 will the Minister continue to maintain the position whereby a miserable percentage of the population can avail of medical cards? He intends to persist with his refusal to extend medical cards to the 200,000 people currently excluded. They should and could be provided for if the Minister managed to stop believing his own propaganda and started listening to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Equity applies to all areas of the health service. It is neither honest nor proper to suggest that there is only one area to which equity applies. Access to hospital beds is a key issue. My major priority in 2002 is to put more beds into the system to ensure the equity that ordinary people deserve in terms of access to medical facilities in hospitals and elective procedures.</P>
      <P>There is a huge equity agenda on disability, which has been neglected for years. In this area we will maintain the momentum, built up by my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, which I continued last year and will continue again this year. There have not been too many Private Members' motions on mental health in the past 20 years. There was no hysteria or great protestations because it was never a great electoral issue or vote getter. There is a degree of cynicism about the Opposition.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry is the statutory body responsible for collating data on the incidence of and mortality from cancer in Ireland. I have been advised by the Director of the National Cancer Registry that the most recent data for national cancer incidence are for 1998. <Col N="1283" /> Analysis of the 1994-98 data by health board area showed that the Eastern Health Board had the highest overall cancer incidence in Ireland. In 1997 analysis was carried out by county. This did not give any statistically significant results. Full details are available in the National Cancer Registry's report, &ldquo;Cancer in Ireland, 1997&rdquo;. I might give some details on that during supplementary questions.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer in recent years. More than £60 million has been invested to date under the national cancer strategy since 1997. This funding has enabled the appointment of 62 additional consultant posts in key areas of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care. The two underlying principles of the strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality and patient focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Cancer is a multifactorial disease and it is vital that our focus is both on the prevention of cancer where possible and on early and appropriate intervention for those who develop cancer. The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives, a number of which have an impact on levels of knowledge and awareness of risk factors associated with many cancers. In the context of the national health strategy, I will continue to be advised by the National Cancer Forum on the planning, development and implementation of cancer services for the country. In this context, commitment has been given to the completion by the end of next year of a new implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. My Department will continue to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

As regards geographical variations, are there any specific areas where the incidence is greater and, if so, why? We hear stories about telecommunications masts, which most of us do not believe.

      <P>I have received further information from the Director of the National Cancer Registry which is contained in the 1997 report to which I referred and which I can send to the Deputy. The most recent data are for 1998. An analysis of the 1994-98 data by the health boards shows that the Eastern Health Board had the highest overall cancer incidence in Ireland and it was statistically significant. The incidence of breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer was also significantly above average in the Eastern Health Board. The incidence of colorectal cancer was significantly higher than the national average in females in the Southern Health Board and in males in the Eastern Health Board. The North-Eastern Health Board had a significantly higher incidence of stomach cancer in females, while the incidence in the Eastern Health Board was significantly higher in males.</P>
      <P>In 1997 an analysis was carried out on a county basis. This did not give many statistically significant results. It was found that the overall incidence of common cancers was significantly higher in Dublin. The incidence of skin cancer and lung cancer was also significantly higher in Dublin. A number of counties had a lower than average cancer incidence. In Tipperary, for example, bowel cancer was lower than average while breast cancer in Wexford and prostate cancer in Kerry were lower than average. Full details are contained in the National Cancer Registry report, &ldquo;Cancer in Ireland, 1997&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Keaveney's question, I am aware that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has embarked on a nationwide survey to identify concentrations of radon in certain locations and it has taken remedial steps in that direction. When I was Minister for Education and Science I initiated a survey with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland of all schools throughout the country. Where high levels were found, it was decided to take remedial measures, which are simple in some instances, to reduce the levels of radon and people's exposure to it in buildings, particularly in schools. I undertake to talk to the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, about that issue.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Boylan's question, screening is extremely important. That is why last year we developed for the first time a national breast screening programme which is confined to three health board areas at present. There are significant logistical and capacity issues in terms of personnel and having expertise in place to roll that out nationally. The board responsible for the BreastCheck programme felt it was important to get it right in terms of the initial phase before the second roll-out phase took place. My understanding is that it will bring recommendations to me about subsequent roll-outs of the breast screening programme. The cervical screening programme is taking place in the mid-west. Analysis must be carried out of its evaluation phase to point out the direction in terms of its subsequent roll-out. A lot has happened in recent years, although it has not happened quickly enough for many people.</P>
      <P>As regards causation, there is no evidence in the figures which points in any direction, including Sellafield. The governing criteria for the causation of cancer seem to revert to lifestyle issues, particularly smoking. The one thing we could do to dramatically reduce certain forms of cancer is to dramatically reduce the incidence of smoking.</P>

Letters of determination will issue once the full detail of funding available for health services in 2002 is formally announced in the budget. In regard to the 450 additional beds planned for the public system in 2002, due to the variety of arrangements planned by health boards and hospitals my Department is not in a position to estimate the staffing requirements with any precision at this time.

It is a very well deserved investment for the people of Longford and Westmeath. A major project like this cannot be completed in six months. Regarding the 650 beds, we invited proposals from the health boards as to what they could do in the short-term to increase bed capacity. They came back to us with those proposals, some of which will involve additional staffing and some of which may not. It is a reconfiguration of existing operations within hospitals.

If the Deputy looked at the letter he would see that it deals with what is going to happen next year, the year after and in the third year in terms of additional capacity coming on stream. If the Deputy were to travel all over the country he would find that the investment made by this Government means that there is not a single hospital which is not receiving major capital investment, refurbishment and modernisation. The hospitals infrastructure did not receive that kind of investment for a long time for a variety of reasons, irrespective of who was in power. Over the last number of years we have been sanctioning projects and commissioning work which will, in time, transform the quality and the environment of our acute hospitals system. No one can take from that. That will certainly happen in Mullingar because of the need which exists there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. I understand that the Western Health Board is aware of the problem referred to by the Deputy and is pursuing a number of possibilities to alleviate it, including the possibility of using private therapists to provide services on its behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concern about current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nation-wide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists. The report was particularly concerned with speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in this area to 2015, was published on 25 July last. The report concludes that a major expansion in the <Col N="1289" /> numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years is essential, including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy.</P>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: the provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; the need for concerted recruitment from overseas; the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end, an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister accept that in the Ballina area of County Mayo alone, there are 49 people on the waiting list for speech therapy, 36 on the waiting list for screening, 31 on the waiting list for review and 44 who have been seen for review, but cannot access the service because one of the two speech therapists has left? It is appalling and unacceptable to have 150 people on a waiting list for speech therapy services. These are people with intellect, talent and ability. They are simply locked up because they are orally constrained. When will the recommendations of the Bacon report come into effect? That is the important question as these people cannot wait any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the state of affairs in Ballina is unacceptable. Current waiting lists for speech and language therapists and other therapies are far too long and have been for quite some time. Such circumstances obtain across the country and reflect very poor planning in the past. They also reflect the reality that we have only one school of speech and language therapy in the country producing about 20 to 23 graduates every year. That has been the case for the past 30 years. I decided to com<Col N="1290" /> mission Peter Bacon and Associates to conduct a proper manpower study in terms of the needs of that profession and others going forward to 2015 so that, in years to come, people can look back on this era and say the correct planning was done and correct provision made for a sufficiency of graduates and therapists to meet the needs of children and older people into the future.</P>
      <P>The report is already in action in the sense that the Higher Education Authority has sought tenders from universities and institutes of technology inviting them to submit proposals to provide for the establishment of new schools of speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy throughout the country. I understand that bidding process will end in a number of weeks and then the HEA, through the specific panel which has been established, will make its decision on the best options and report back to us.</P>

Is he in a position to give a categorical assurance that these new schools and new places will come on stream next September or October for the beginning of the new university year? What is the anticipated intake for next September or October? The salary structure for speech therapists appears to be a problem. Speech therapy is an area where there appears to be a huge demand while also a huge reluctance on the part of people to enter the profession because of the salary structure. What will the intake be next September and what is the position on restructuring the salary scale to give these people considerably more inducements and to make it more attractive for them to enter the service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be my intention if at all possible to do that.

Last year we managed to get some interim additional places, albeit on a small scale. The anticipated intake will be dependent on the type of proposals which emerge, but Peter Bacon has recommended an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That would give about 1,000 speech and language therapists in 2015, taking into account a four year degree programme. We achieved this in nursing this year, for example, where a significant allocation was made in this year's Estimates for moving nursing to a degree programme in universities and the third level sector. We would like to achieve a similar historic shift for speech and language therapy and occu<Col N="1291" /> pational therapy. It is a key challenge facing the health service and education service and we are determined to achieve it.</P>
      <P>The expert group on various health professions was established some time ago. It published a report last year and we have implemented each of its recommendations. The funding was made available to implement every recommendation emanating from that report. Time has moved on and we are continuing to meet the professions on that.</P>

What are the short-term solutions or measures he will put in place to ensure speech therapy is provided to children throughout the country?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Overseas recruitment is probably the most effective interim solution we can put in place. As a result of poor planning in the past and the fact there was only one speech and language therapy school in the country for about 30 years, we have a problem with a chronic shortage of speech and language therapists. I accept the position is not acceptable in terms of the services we need to provide to children with disabilities or speech and language difficulties and to older people with speech and language difficulties. The solution is utilisation of whatever spare private sector capacity exists and overseas recruitment.</P>
      <P>On the nursing front, we demonstrated we could achieve a great deal in the interim by an aggressive, proactive overseas recruitment strategy. A similar exercise will have to be undertaken in terms of the therapy grades and especially in terms of speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.</P>

      <P>It is not only the last budget of our current term, but it also comes at a pivotal point in terms of the uncertain world economic outlook.</P>
      <P>This is a budget designed to secure the future for us all in a fair and balanced manner. It will do this by carefully managing the public finances to sustain confidence in the economy. It is a budget in which the resources available now and going forward are more constrained than we would wish. This requires us to match our spending plans and the resources we have to achieve them.</P>
      <P>This is a budget in which we must safeguard the vulnerable in society, we must prioritise our needs and we must continue to invest for the future. This is a budget which will secure sustainable growth. It will ensure that Ireland emerges from this period of uncertainty stronger than ever and ready to achieve our future potential.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Borrowing and Investing</i>In 2002 I will not be borrowing. I am budgeting for an Exchequer surplus and a general Government surplus. My views on the imprudence of Exchequer borrowing are well known and of long standing. We got ourselves into a mire by borrowing for current purposes in the past. The legacy hung around our necks for more than 20 years. I am not going to repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a firm believer in investing for the future. I will be meeting the statutory requirement of providing 1% of GNP for the national pension reserve fund out of currently available resources. I do not go along with those who call for us to cease providing for future ageing costs by means of contributions to the national pension reserve fund. If this concept is to work, what is required is a continuing commitment to resource it and not a fair weather one. If we fail to do this, it becomes even more difficult to persuade the public to make provision for their own retirement and other ageing costs. This budget will ensure that <Col N="1293" /> the funding of this reserve is not disrupted by the less favourable economic outlook for 2002.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Consequences of the Change to the Euro</i>An historic change in the economic life of the country will take place in 2002. Between 1 January and 9 February next, the new euro notes and coins will progressively displace the cash that we have all been used to, thereby completing the introduction of the single European currency. The Central Bank of Ireland is at the centre of the cash changeover both through its statutory role in the issue of banknotes and its involvement, as an agent of the State, in the provision of coin. A corollary of this is that there are certain once-off benefits to the finances of the bank. There are two distinct aspects, one relating to the note issuance and the other to the provision of coin.</P>
    <P>As regards the first, the replacement of Irish banknotes by their euro counterparts will, by reason of the way the note issuance has been treated in the accounts of the bank in the past, generate a windfall boost to the bank's surplus income. I am advised by the bank that the bulk of this windfall will materialise in 2002 when it will add an estimated 240 million to the surplus income. I propose that this amount will transfer to the Exchequer in 2002.</P>
    <P>The introduction of euro coin has highlighted an anomaly in the way the seigniorage, or economic benefit, associated with the right to issue coin is brought to account in Ireland. The norm in other EU member states is that the state receives the benefit and this is in line with the Maastricht Treaty. Unusually, under our legislation, that benefit is assigned to the currency reserve of the Central Bank, although the bank merely acts as an agent of the State in the provision of coin. I propose to rectify the position by introducing legislation which will assign to the Exchequer the proceeds of future coin issue, that is, the issue of euro coin. This will, I am informed by the bank, benefit the Exchequer to the extent of some 370 million in 2002.</P>
    <P>These measures will together benefit the Exchequer to the extent of some 610 million next year. This will be applied towards the funding of the required contribution to the national pension reserve fund. The legislation, which I intend to bring forward at an early date, will contain all the provisions necessary to give effect to my intentions.</P>
    <P>This budget seeks to do four things: to develop our infrastructure; to improve public services and promote equity; to encourage enterprise and investment; and, to do so in a way that sustains fiscal policy. Achieving such goals would be a challenge even in settled times. It is a greater challenge when so much uncertainty prevails regarding the short-term international economic outlook. I have no crystal ball to see through the clouds of uncertainty nor do others. As I have said many times, economics is not an exact science. What happened this year is, in my view, <Col N="1294" /> proof of that. This means that we should be cautious in our assessments going forward and, as a country, we will need to take stock of the situation again when it comes to the next budget.</P>
    <P>This year's budget has been framed against the prospect of a significant slowdown in our economic growth in 2002, due mainly to international factors. The slowdown began earlier this year and was exacerbated by unfortunate and horrific events during the year. The key characteristic of the current global economic environment is uncertainty about the timing and pace of recovery. The estimates being made by market commentators for Ireland's GDP growth next year vary from as low as 1.5% to as high as 7%. The IMF, the OECD and the European Commission's forecasts are in the middle of this range. My estimate is in this range also. I expect GDP growth next year to slow significantly to 3.9%. Going forward, I expect a pick-up to our medium-term potential growth rate of around 5%. These forecasts represent our best estimate, but obviously they are subject to the risk of variation in view of the uncertain international outlook.</P>
    <P>Employment is expected to increase by about 1.5% annually to 2004. Unemployment could average 4.75% next year but the upward trend should reverse as external conditions improve. After a temporary upturn early next year, consumer price inflation is projected to ease, helped by lower imported inflation, before falling to 2.25% by 2004. Full details of the economic projections underlying the budget are included in the stability programme update, which I am publishing today.</P>
    <P>There is no point in wishful dreaming. The reality is that the future is particularly uncertain at present. Nevertheless, our economy is basically in good shape and that message should go out clearly. As long as we take account of the reality of the current situation and position ourselves to take full advantage of the recovery when it comes, we will have done well.</P>
    <P>The 2002 budgetary targets, which take account of the measures I am announcing today, are as follows: an increase in net current spending of 10.5% and in net capital spending of 10.5% over the 2001 projected out-turn; a current budget surplus of 5,570 million; a capital budget deficit of 5,400 million; an Exchequer surplus of 170 million, including a release of 500 million from the capital services redemption account to meet interest costs on the national debt; a general Government surplus of 837 million or 0.7% of GDP; and a debt to GDP ratio of 34%, the second lowest in the EU.</P>
    <P>These targets are subject to the same caveats as to uncertainty as the range of forecasts I mentioned earlier. The projected Exchequer surplus allows for a limited provision for the cost of benchmarking in 2002 since it is impossible at this stage to predict what costs will arise from this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the current economic climate we must make clear choices if we are to continue to safeguard our future economic progress. We must also safeguard the position of the vulnerable and create scope for further economic growth to create jobs. This is consistent with the aims of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the budget will help deliver further on the goals of this programme. In shaping our budgetary provisions for next year, our focus has been on managing the challenges immediately ahead in order to secure our longer-term goals. These goals have been well captured by our agreement with the social partners under the PPF, which seeks to build a competitive, prosperous, fairer and more inclusive Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have already made significant progress towards these goals over the period of the PPF but, as agreed with the social partners, the pace of progress has to reflect economic growth. The likelihood of growth below the PPF forecasts next year therefore requires us to be flexible, while maintaining our capacity to accelerate the rate of progress over subsequent years. As envisaged in the PPF, we have developed frameworks which set out our ambition for the medium term. In the national development plan, we outlined the scope of our vision for the development of the infrastructure required by a modern and dynamic society.</P>
      <P>A key objective of this budget is to continue to raise the quality of our public services. We have shown our commitment to this goal. Between 1997 and 2002, and taking account of the additional expenditure provided today, the Government will have increased net voted current expenditure by 10.3 billion, or 79%, and net voted capital expenditure by 3.7 billion, or 195%. Now more than ever we need to continue to improve the overall management of public expenditure. We must focus on what we are achieving in terms of real output and outcomes. Such an approach will help deliver better public services. Increased expenditure is not always enough on its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also my view, based on my experience over the past five years, that we should move in the future to a unified tax and expenditure budget in which all tax and spending decisions are announced as one on budget day and not in two stages, as happens now. Over and above the figures provided in the published expenditure Estimates last month, and including the social welfare package, I am providing an additional 1.35 billion in net current spending and a further 550 million in net capital spending for next year. The full range of additions to both current and capital spending are included in the summary. My statement will deal with the main items. Last month, in announcing the Estimates, I indicated that I had decided to concentrate the available resources on a number of specific areas. Accord<Col N="1296" /> ingly, my announcements today are concerned with infrastructure, the development of a quality healthcare service and enhanced social welfare provision.</P>
    <P>Our economy has performed well in recent years. We have raised our income levels to above the EU average. However, our infrastructure needs to match up with the rest of the economy. The expenditure Estimates which were published on 15 November provided significant capital allocations in 2002 for roads, public transport, water, housing and education. The extra 550 million I am announcing today for capital spending is mainly for roads, public transport, housing, water services, waste management, education, health, harbours and telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Total Exchequer capital investment next year in roads alone will be 1 billion, with over 450 million being invested in public transport. Total Exchequer capital spending on housing in 2002 will be almost 1.1 billion, while capital funding for education, to build and refurbish schools and third level colleges, will amount to some 560 million.</P>
    <P>By the end of next year we will have spent 8.5 billion on the economic and social infrastructure programme of the national development plan which is above that promised in the published operational programme. This Government is fully committed to the implementation of the national development plan because it lays the foundation for our future economic growth. Details of the additional capital spending are set out in the summary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Private Partnerships</i>Public private partnerships will make a further contribution to delivery of priority economic infrastructure projects under the national development plan. Construction work has begun on five post-primary schools following the signing of a PPP contract in recent weeks. A further 42 pilot projects are being developed in the areas of roads, rail, environment and education, with additional projects in these and other areas currently being assessed. Over the next three years these projects should contribute private finance in the region of 800 million to our infrastructure programme.</P>
    <P>TOURISM</P>
    <P>Tourism has made an important contribution to our economy, especially in creating jobs. It has also helped to spread the benefits of our economic growth throughout the country. Next year will be a very challenging year for tourism. In order to support the industry, I propose allocating an additional 11 million for tourism marketing on top of the provisions already contained in the Estimates. The funding will be used for regional and sports tourism and for the international marketing of the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>HEALTH</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Health and Chil<Col N="1297" /> dren launched the health strategy. This strategy represents a blueprint for the development of the health services over the next decade, with a particular emphasis on improving the quality of service delivery.</P>
    <P>Today I am allocating additional Exchequer funding of 425 million, with a full year cost of 613 million.</P>
    <P>This brings gross health expenditure to nearly 8.2 billion for 2002. The Minister for Health and Children will be announcing the full details in due course. These will include spending on additional beds for acute hospitals, the setting up of a treatment purchase fund to reduce waiting times for public patients and to add to the range of service delivery options. They will also include funding for the physically and intellectually disabled and older people as well as the development of certain GP initiatives.</P>
    <P>The development of the health services has been a priority for this Government. Between 1997 and 2002 we will have increased the gross health and children allocation by over 4.5 billion or 125 per cent.</P>

      <P>After many years when our expenditure on health trailed behind most of the rest of Europe, Ireland's position is now on a par with the EU average. As our population ages in future years, the pressures on health spending will increase further. Our planning must take account of this, as well as the pressures in many other areas.</P>

      <P>This Government has done more than any other in the history of the State to promote social inclusion, far more than our immediate predecessor. Last year's social welfare package was a major leap forward in protecting the vulnerable in society. This year will continue that progress.</P>
      <P>From the outset, it has been a central goal of this Government that everybody should have the opportunity and incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country. Under our stewardship, employment opportunities have been greatly expanded. This has been the single biggest factor in advancing social inclusion in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have committed unprecedented amounts of money to delivering on social inclusion. In the health strategy, we have set out the developments and the restructuring which will be pursued over the coming years to provide the efficient and responsive health care system which our people require.</P>
      <P>The review of the national anti-poverty strategy is nearing completion. The Government's response to this review will provide the basis for action in this area into the future. In last year's budget alone I provided over 1.5 billion in full year terms for social inclusion measures across all Departments. This year, notwithstanding the greater constraints on the public finances, I am following this up with a further allocation of over 1.6 billion in full year terms.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Social Insurance Fund</i>Since its inception in 1953 the Exchequer has assisted the social insurance fund. For instance, in the ten years to 1996, the Exchequer contribution exceeded 2 billion. Thanks to this Government's record on employment, the fund is now in such a healthy financial position that the Exchequer can recover some of this funding.</P>

      <P>For 2002, all social welfare weekly increases will be paid with effect from 1 January.

        <i>Old Age Pensions</i>Each of my budgets has clearly demonstrated this Government's commitment to supporting the position of our old age pensioners. This year is no different. Today I am increasing the full personal rate of old age and related pensions by at least a further £10 per week. This will bring the old age contributory pension to £116 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to over £105 per week. We have more than achieved our commitment to increasing all old age pensions to at least £100 per week over this Government's term. This means that with the proposed increase in the qualified adult payment, a contributory old age pensioner couple, both aged over 66 years, will next year receive over £205 per week. Taking my five budgets together, the personal rate of old age contributory pension will have gone up by nearly 50% while a couple both over 66 years will be getting 54% more.</P>

        <i>Other Weekly Payments and Qualified Adult Allowances</i>I am also matching last year's record increases by providing at least a further £8 per week for other full rate social welfare recipients. This increase is much greater than projected inflation for 2002 and allows for continued improvement in the position of all social welfare dependent households.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, I commenced a phased increase in the rate of qualified adult allowances from 60% to 70% of the personal rate. I am providing today for a further substantial step towards this goal. Accordingly, this allowance in general will be increased by more than £8 per week&mdash;</P>

Families with children will also receive the child benefit improvements which I am announcing today.</P>
      <P>I am also providing for a special increase in the lowest social welfare payment rates. Accordingly, recipients of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance will benefit from a weekly increase of more than £9.50.

        <i>Child Benefit</i>Last year I announced the Government's intention to invest around £1 billion in increased child benefit over a three year period.

Child benefit also offers a most effective means of channelling income support to low-income families in order to tackle child poverty.</P>
      <P>In line with the record increases which I provided last year, I am now announcing the second step in this three year programme. This will see child benefit rates increased by a further £25 per month for the first and second children to £92.62, and by £30 per month for third and subsequent children to £116.</P>
      <P>These increases will be paid in May but back-dated to April, or five months earlier than when we came into office. The increases mean that child benefit will have gone up by £62.60 per month for first and second children&mdash;</P>

      <P>In addition, I am proposing improvements to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. From next year, more than 70,000 children aged 12 years and over will benefit from an increase in the payment rate which will rise to more than £94 per child.

        <i>Personal Taxation</i>This Government in its term in office has rewarded work and enterprise, as it set out to do, by substantially reducing the tax burden on ordinary taxpayers. In particular, the Government has delivered on what it promised the electorate in 1997 in relation to income taxation. As a result of our five budgets more than 380,000 taxpayers will have been removed from the tax net&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;both tax rates have been reduced substantially, along with PRSI and levies; <Col N="1303" /> all taxpayers and especially those on lower pay have benefited; the tax system has been made fundamentally more equitable through the introduction of tax credits in budget 1999 &ndash; something those opposite spoke of but did not do when they had the chance.</P>
      <P>After this budget there will be more than 690,000 income earners outside the tax net or 37% of all those on Revenue's records. The corresponding figures when we took office were 380,000 or 26%.</P>
      <P>Of the 4.8 billion in tax reductions in these five budgets, 43% has gone on increasing the basic tax allowances, or credits as they are now, including the PAYE allowance; a further 22% went in taking more than 370,000 taxpayers off the top rate of tax; more than 16% went to reduce the standard rate of tax paid by all taxpayers, and just 11% went to cut the top rate of income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the case. All taxpayers have benefited substantially from the major tax reforms and tax reductions which this Government has carried out.</P>
      <P>This Government has succeeded in transforming the income tax system to give the country a simpler, fairer and more rewarding system. I have done more than most to close off certain abusive tax loopholes through which the very well off could reduce their taxable income to almost nil. Tax reliefs are still required to stimulate enterprise and investment, but they must be carefully focused to ensure they hit their targets.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Changes in Tax Credits and Bands</i>Last year I indicated that the Government intended to increase the income tax entry point towards the level of the minimum wage. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness made it clear that it was an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners to make this happen over time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to say that further substantial progress is being made this year by increasing the basic personal tax credit by 123 to 1,520 and the PAYE tax credit by 152 to 660. The effect of this will be to raise the entry point to the tax system for a single person to £165 <Col N="1304" /> per week or more than 209 and to remove 68,000 low income earners from the tax net. When we came into office the relevant entry point was £77 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This entry point to the income tax system will now be at 90% of the current minimum wage. I am also increasing the single standard rate band by 2,605 to 28,000 with relevant changes to the married bands as set out in the Summary of Budget Measures. The impact of these changes will be to remove 57,000 taxpayers from the higher rate of income tax in 2002.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Relief for the Elderly</i>When we came into office, the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over were as low as 5,840 per annum single and 11,680 married. I have increased these substantially in my first four budgets. I propose to increase them again. The new limits will be 13,000 and 26,000 &ndash; an increase of more than 120% in my period in office. This will remove more than 11,000 elderly taxpayers from the tax net. This is in addition to the 68,000 low income earners already removed from the tax net by the tax credit changes just announced.</P>
      <P>INDIRECT TAXES</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to restore the standard rate of VAT to 21% from 1 March 2002. I had reservations about cutting that rate last year. I said I would be looking to see if it was fully passed on. I am not convinced that this was the case. The VAT-inclusive excise duty on petrol and diesel will be increased by 5p per litre from midnight tonight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> The overall impact on the consumer price index of the increases in VAT and excises is estimated at 0.9%, giving an average inflation rate for next year of 4.2%. The revenue raised will help towards funding the extra spending on the important public services developments I announced a short time ago. We also need to maintain revenue from indirect taxes if we are to be serious about reducing the burden of other taxation on effort and enterprise.</P>
    <P>BUSINESS TAXATION</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employers' PRSI</i>In the area of business taxation I am reducing the top rate of employers' PRSI from 12% to 10.75% with effect from 1 March 2002 at a full year cost of 347 million. I had planned more wide-ranging reforms of the PRSI system to simplify it and rationalise its application, but the changed situation in the public finances has put the completion of these plans beyond reach at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>The standard rate of corporation tax on trading profits will fall to 16% from 1 January 2002 and 12.5% the following year. I am now providing that over the next five years companies will move to a situation in which their main corporation tax payments will be made on a current year basis, instead of the existing system under which all tax is paid well after the end of the accounting year. This change will yield a large cash flow benefit to the Exchequer in each of those five years. This will amount to 792 million in 2002.</P>

    <P>The figures shown for receipts and expenditure in 2001 are projected outturns and reflect present knowledge. They are subject to revision when the end-year figures become available. Fully audited details for 2001 will be available in the <i>2001 Finance Accounts</i> to be published not later than 30 September 2002.</P>
    <P>2.<i>Revenue</i>The estimate of revenue for 2002 is based on the tax provisions in force at present. The projected outturn for 2001 includes 223 million collected under the Voluntary Disclosure Scheme (see Note 1 on page 1311).</P>
    <P>3.<i>Expenditure</i>The <i>Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version)</i> &amp; <i>Summary Public Capital Programme 2002</i> (AEV), was published on 15 November 2001. The estimated expenditure figures for 2002 contained in the White Paper are consistent with those published in the AEV. However, the 2001 outturn figures for voted expenditure are different from the 2001 figures which were published in the AEV as the figures have been revised to reflect more up-to-date information.</P>
    <P>4.<i>Appropriations-in-Aid</i>Voted expenditures are shown net of Appropriations-in-Aid. These are receipts which, with the agreement of the Dáil, may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenditures instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund. Details of gross voted expenditures by Departments are contained in the <i>Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version)</i> &amp; <i>Summary Public Capital Programme 2002.</i>5.<i>PRSI</i>PRSI contributions are paid into the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and <i>do not </i>form part of the revenues paid into the Central Fund as is explained in the following paragraphs.</P>

    <P>a)payments out of the SIF which are related to the entitlement of persons under their insurance/PRSI/benefit record, e.g. unemployment benefit, contributory pensions, etc.,</P>
    <P>b)payments to persons who <i>have ceased to qualify or have never qualified </i>under their insurance/PRSI/benefit record to be paid out of the SIF, e.g. unemployment  assistance, non-contributory pensions, etc., and</P>
    <P>c)other payments such as grants to organisations.</P>
    <P>The amount voted by the Dáil to the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs is composed of payments falling under (f2&gt;b) and (f2&gt;c) above, together with any sum needed by the SIF to ensure that the total income of the fund is not less than the total sum paid out of the Fund in any year.</P>
    <P>For most past years, an Exchequer contribution has been required to meet the shortfall on SIF. However, no Exchequer contribution has been required since 1997.</P>
    <P>6.<i>Prefunding of future pensions liabilities</i>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000 provides for prefunding part of the future cost of social welfare and public service pensions, and the setting aside of 1% of estimated Gross National Product (GNP) annually for this purpose (see Note 7 on page 1311).</P>
    <P>7.<i>Proceeds from sale of ICC Investment Bank and TSB</i>The proceeds from the sale of ICC Investment Bank and TSB in 2001 are included as Capital Receipts (see Note 5 on page 1311).</P>
    <P>8.<i>Service of National Debt</i>The 2001 projected Central Fund outturn reflects a reduction of 56 million in the assets of the Capital Services Redemption Account. The 2002 figure reflects a reduction of 292 million in these assets.</P>
    <P>9.<i>Tables in Euro</i>The Tables and Notes shown on pages 1311 to 1317 are denominated in euros. Tables and Notes in Irish pound equivalents are shown on pages 1319 to 1325. Rounding may affect totals.</P>

    <P>Mr. J. Mitchell: If I recall correctly, the budget speech last year was greeted by the same bellows from the benches opposite. Never before was a budget presented to this House in which the figures were so inaccurate. I acknowledge that the Minister is presenting his fifth budget which, in different circumstances, would be seen as an achievement. However, looking at the state of the Exchequer's finances as just confirmed, this is a miracle budget which has turned wine into water. Thankfully, it will be the Minister's last.</P>
    <P>Never before has a Minister for Finance come into the House with so much egg on his face or with such inaccurate figures from his last budget. There is a divergence of 4.3 billion when one takes into account the surplus and once-off issues. We have had a surplus of a little over 100 million compared to a forecast by the Minister on this day last year of 4.4 billion. If the Minister is as <Col N="1326" /> inaccurate again this year, we will have a deficit by the end of next year of close to 5 billion even before we count the creative accounting and the mirroring, massaging and distortion of figures in this budget.</P>
    <P>In recent times I had the enforced opportunity to reflect on the really important things in life which most people will agree are our health and the health of our loved ones, our families, education and security, the dignity of a job, a decent home and the time to enjoy all of these. What have today's budget and the previous four budgets done to support and foster these important goals? Waiting lists have soared in the health services. At Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, they are 91% greater than when the Minister came to office. Through his tampering, trickery and tinkering with the housing market, a home for hard-working young people is unaffordable and this budget will not change that. Those <Col N="1327" /> who did manage to buy a house sit this evening in traffic gridlock contemplating how they will pay their huge mortgages.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be done without resources. The Minister presided over the Exchequer in its five most prosperous years. The question on everybody's lips today is &ldquo;where has the money gone?&rdquo;. The Minister says he is not borrowing when in fact he is borrowing from the Central Bank and the social insurance fund. He can do this on a one-off basis, but the figures will have to be included in next year's budget. The Minister is falsifying the figures and playing with mirrors.</P>

      <P>Compared to his forecast of 4.4 billion last year, it is a turnaround of 5.575 billion in one year which represents gross incompetence. This is a creative accountant, not a creative Minister.</P>
      <P>At the weekend, the Taoiseach claimed the deterioration was entirely due to factors outside our control. He blamed foot and mouth disease and 11 September for all our problems and repeated the claim on three occasions in the course of a two minute interview. Let us consider what happened in other countries. In Britain, foot and mouth disease was much worse and lasted for much longer than here and the impact of the 11 September massacre was just as great, yet the deterioration in our budget <i>versus </i>national income over the past 12 months is four times greater than that in the UK. This does not only apply to the UK. Were France and Germany not affected by 11 September and foot and mouth disease?</P>
      <P>The deterioration of Ireland's finances from the last budget to this one was 4.2%.</P>

      <P>In the UK it was 0.8%, in Germany 1% and in France only 0.5%. This is the international effect of foot and mouth disease and 11 September. It seems the Taoiseach is claiming these are the only factors which undermined the ebullient forecast of the Minister last year. I assert to the House and the people watching on television that today's state of the nation's finances is not a problem of international confidence, but one of home-made incompetence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What really highlights the Government's incompetence is that earlier this year, when it became evident revenues were falling significantly below expectation, the Minister for Finance not only failed to rein in public expenditure, he went on a splurge. At a time when he needed to diet he did not merely go to the fridge, he got into it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure in the second half of this year was increased threefold above the norm of previous years, which really highlights how false are the Taoiseach's claims that the problems are international. They are overwhelmingly domestic and overwhelmingly the creation of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The figures have been massaged in the hope that analysts will not notice. It commenced with the Book of Estimates which, for the first time since 1981 when Fianna Fáil was also in power, are incomplete and economical with the truth.</P>
      <P>It is not clear whether the White Paper on receipts and expenditure is a true and accurate comparison with last year's White Paper in so far as there is more than a suspicion that some of next year's expenditure has been brought forward to this year. This would have the effect of creating a higher base on which next year's increases will be based and thus would massage the percentage increases next year making them look smaller than they really are. It is an attempt to tone down the true level of the collapse in the public finances. This is not just a swing, it is an implosion. It is as if the McCreevy Rangers are four goals up with 15 minutes to go and end up being trounced seven to four. They now face relegation to the Opposition benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's figures tell us that voted current expenditure went up this year by 23%. Such an increase should have left its mark and been noticed by people everywhere. In reality, no one can see it anywhere. I have been asked time and again in the past few weeks where the money has gone. It is as if over 4 billion has gone missing. That is more than enough to open an Ansbacher account for every member of Fianna Fáil, dead or alive. One could even buy a diamond ring for every woman in the country and give a free ticket to every man for the World Cup in Japan and South Korea. It is a loss of mammoth pro<Col N="1329" /> portions. I am reminded of that line in the movie &ldquo;Jerry Maguire&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;Show me the money&rdquo;. The truth is it is gone with the wind. The Government has squandered it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first bid by a Fianna Fáil Minister for the Department of Finance that I have heard so far in public. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, budgeted for an already excessive 20% increase in voted current expenditure but this has now risen to 23%. However, this does not tell the full grim reality of the mess into which he has got us. In the second half of this year &ndash; this is one of the hidden matters which analysts may not notice &ndash; expenditure is 30% greater than in the first half. The normal year's increase in the second half of the year over the first half is only 10%. The increase in the second half is three times what is normal. If we project that into the future and into the post-election situation, we are facing a much grimmer 2002 than the Minister would like to pretend.</P>
      <P>This budget has all the hallmarks of Fianna Fáil in the 1977-82 period, during which it turned a sound economy into a basket case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the statistics, now that the Minister mentioned unemployment. In 1977, there were 87,000 unemployed. By the time Fianna Fáil left office in 1982, the figure was marching towards 200,000 and then 300,000. The Minister should stay quiet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, in that period Fianna Fáil turned a sound economy into a basket case. I had believed those GUBU years were forever in the past. They are back. Fianna Fail has once again misspent its way into a crisis. After its last reckless splurge, it was Fine Gael and the Tallaght strategy that came to the rescue. I had thought the benefits of sound finances had been learned by all. Despite this gigantic waste of public money there are still many glaring gaps in our public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, true to his current form, ignored the less well off in our society, penalised them and brought in his famous dirty dozen measures. He has done it again. I want to give <Col N="1330" /> just 12 examples of the Government's failures. There are 27,000 people on hospital waiting lists. As I said earlier, there is an increase of 91% in the waiting list at the children's hospital in Crumlin. In the Mater Hospital, with which the Taoiseach will be familiar because it is in his and my constituency, the waiting lists have risen by 41% since he became Taoiseach. That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>There are 120,000 people on housing waiting lists, which is more than double the number in 1997 when Fianna Fáil came to power, despite the fact that it has enjoyed the five most prosperous years in our nation's history.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Young people in primary schools are waiting more than eight years for orthodontic treatment. The position has deteriorated during its term of office. There are now 15,000 children, some of whom are 18 and 19 years of age who were prescribed this treatment when they were ten and 11 years old, waiting on that service. In Northern Ireland, the wait is less than one year.</P>
      <P>Widows and persons on long-term sickness allowances, until today, were expected to live on as little as £85.00 a week. For the widow and for those who are sick long-term this means no hair-do and no pint. They cannot afford to go to the hairdresser and they cannot afford to go to the pub.</P>
      <P>During the term of office of the Government, parents of children with autism have had to go to court to demand a fair chance for their children and cancer patients have to go to court to demand life saving treatment. An individual who receives £101 or more per week does not qualify for a medical card. If such people have to pay £25 or £30 for a visit to a doctor, 30% of their weekly income is spent on doctors. They cannot afford to go to doctors.</P>

      <P>Many thousands of people, even after today's budget, on the minimum wage still pay income tax. The 7.5% of people who are earning more than £200,000 a year have gained as much as £50,000 in tax concessions during the Minister's term in office. His behaviour as Minister for Social Welfare and as Minister for Finance is consistent. He has shown contempt for the less well-off. Many thousands of disabled people are immobilised because of a lack of personal assistants and by the lack of priority given to this issue by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few young people can afford to buy their own homes. This has emerged during the term of office of this Government. It is a creation of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Housing output has fallen steadily this year. The number of housing completions is down by more than 10% and, worse still, the number of housing starts is down by almost 20%. This means there <Col N="1331" /> will be even fewer houses next year. We also have more traffic jams and traffic gridlock directly as a result of the Government's traffic policy, with greatly increased journey times, stress and air pollution at enormous economic cost.</P>
    <P>These are the new McCreevy dirty dozen, which come from the same stable as his original dirty dozen when he was Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>If we were to benchmark the Minister's performance against his spending on those 12 issues, he would come out as a right dunce.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic confidence and sound finances, no matter how one analyses the issue the Minister has made a mess of things. That is not to say the parties in the Government have not made a significant contribution to the economic miracle known as the Celtic tiger, but the Minister has crash landed our economy, which was flying high before he took the helm.</P>
      <P>It was the parties now in Opposition who laid the foundation for economic growth. Fine Gael and Labour brought down inflation from 21%, the rate left by Fianna Fáil in 1982, to 4% by 1986, and it remained below 4% every year until the Ahern-McCreevy Government came into office. Resulting from the drop in inflation, the same Fine Gael-Labour Government turned a large Fianna Fáil balance of trade deficit into a surplus in 1986, and our trade has been in surplus since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was Fine Gael and Labour that introduced airline competition in 1985, which brought millions of tourists to the country and created many jobs. It was a Fine Gael and Labour Government that transformed the semi-State sector from financial chaos left by Fianna Fáil in 1982 to a state <Col N="1332" /> of financial health by 1987. It was a Fine Gael and Labour Government that established the national lottery which has done so much for sport, recreation and charity. It was Fine Gael that proposed the Tallaght strategy, which was the mother and father of the Celtic tiger. It was a Fine Gael and Labour Government that introduced the 12.5% corporation tax which all acknowledge is the main attraction for our highly successful world record in drawing foreign direct investment and creating tens of thousands of new jobs. It was a Fine Gael and Labour Government that abolished third level fees which has helped many young people through college and to improve their job prospects. It was a Fine Gael and Labour Government that first accepted the principle of an annual budget set-aside to cover future pension costs and it was a Fine Gael and Labour Government that brought about the first current budget surplus.</P>
    <P>The present awful mess, which is solely of the makings of the current Government, should not be allowed undermine confidence in our economy. I have every confidence in the economy but I have no confidence in the Minister. I am confident about our economy because, among other things our debt-GNP ratio is the lowest in the EU except Luxembourg. Our total revenue take is the lowest in the EU and even lower than the USA. Our employment levels are up by 750,000. We have effectively achieved full employment. Our income<i> per capita</i> now exceeds the EU average. I am very proud of the significant contribution that Fine Gael and Labour have made to bringing this economic miracle about.</P>
    <P>We do not want these sound finances and this sound economy undermined. If the Government continues with its current policies and mismanagement it will be undermined. I have great confidence in the economy but I have no confidence in this Minister for Finance and the sooner he is moved, the better for our country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance proudly proclaims that he has doubled health spending since 1997. He points to the increase of more than 20,000 in the numbers working in the health service. Yet the much vaunted health strategy points out that we need 8,000 nurses and 1,000 hospital consultants because the Minister sanctioned additional administrators not medical professionals. Having doubled spending, waiting lists are, at best, unchanged and at worst significantly longer. I have twice referred to the National Children's Hospital in Crumlin. Is it not a sign of an uncaring, heartless Government that in a time of economic prosperity it would allow its waiting list rise by 91% since this Government took office? Is this how we cherish the children of the nation?</P>
    <P>Where is the money going? Ireland, the fastest growing economy in the OECD in the past five years has to ship its sick abroad for treatment. Can people see what a farce this is? The health strategy suggests that some of the waiting lists can be dealt with by purchasing private beds. If these beds have been available, it is a scandal that pub<Col N="1333" /> lic patients have had to sue in court to find a bed and this Government waits until the eve of an election to take an initiative. The Minister has, as usual, thrown money at the problems in the health service. My party does not object to money being spent &ndash; we support it &ndash; but we object to money being spent without results.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister announced millions of pounds of additional capital for health. Yet there are examples of wasted money throughout the country. For example, the 98 bed extension to Mullingar General Hospital, which was built when the present Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Health, remains unoccupied and has not even been fitted out. If it had been opened as originally planned in 1997 it would have cost £11 million. The extension will now open in 2007 at a cost of £43 million. This highlights the wasteful nature of this Government's expenditure and is why it has spent double the money and yet has not improved the health sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>People cannot trust this Government and this is why we cannot trust the people's health to this Government. Health spending has increased by 3 billion per annum with no results. How can we trust this Government to deliver 10 billion of value under the health strategy? We got 400 billion in today's budget which is in reality only 300 million because the Minister played tricks with the Estimates. When one takes the full-year effects of the initiatives during this year, the money in the Book of Estimates is actually 99 million less than the out-turn for this year &ndash; a reduction in health expenditure.</P>
      <P>The increase is therefore of 300 million. Inflation in medical goods and services is almost three times that of ordinary inflation so, in real terms, this is a reduction in health expenditure by some amount. Where is the £10 billion plan? It is actually a £1 billion plan <i>per annum</i>. The Government proposes to increase expenditure in a year by £1 billion and then multiply it by ten for each year of the plan. It is a trick, like most of the figures in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> The launch of this strategy has been the most cynical exercise in political spinning in memory. The Minister announced that some money would be spent to deal with a crisis of waiting lists. Last year's 14 million was allocated and clearly achieved nothing. Money is being claimed to have been spent but waiting lists are longer. If what we hear of plans to send patients abroad is true then most of today's allocation will go on air fares as patients will be accompanied by at least one nurse as well as a relative and the money will have to be spent on their accommodation also. This is comment enough on the Government's complete failure in this area.</P>
    <P>In any socially just society the less well off must be provided with a minimum income that keeps them above the poverty line. The most urgent and needy cases are widows and those single people who live on a long-term sickness allowance. The value of their pension is about £40 per week behind that of pensioners when the free schemes are taken into account. The Minister has closed that gap by £2 per week. Old age pensioners get £10 more and widows get £12 more which is a welcome step in the right direction but why should a 59, 60 or 61 year old widow living on her own look forward to turning 66 so she can get the free allowances for ESB, TV licence, travel and fuel? Why should she wait in poverty? These people are the most disregarded in our society along with single people suffering from long-term illness. The Minister's approach to them, today, while welcome, does not go far enough. His treatment of widows in the past has been callous.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, social welfare is often allocated in a way that acts as a poverty trap. This is the case for single mothers who wish to marry. If they get married they lose all their benefits. It is important that any improvements in social welfare are made in a way that does not create drops such as these. An elderly person wishing to have a member of the family living with him or her cannot do so in the context of the living alone allowance. The reversal of this could help solve the housing problem as well as problems of security and loneliness.</P>
    <P>Many carers providing 24 hour a day, seven day a week care are only receiving £88 per week. They are completely disregarded and taken for granted by an uncaring Government in the most prosperous era in our nation's history.</P>
    <P>After five years of unparalleled prosperity many of our citizens live in a twilight zone. Despite the prosperity, life is not good for them. Female participation in the workplace is at its highest level since the foundation of the State. There are now over 300,000 families where both spouses work, some by choice, but many because the cost of housing has exceeded the capacity of many single income families. Two years ago, through the process of individualisation, the Minister gave further incentives for both spouses to work. At the time I predicted a problem which is now about to emerge. Given the downturn in <Col N="1335" /> the economy and the likely loss of jobs by many of those working as one of a couple, they will not only lose their salary, but will be expected to pay £42 more in tax. It is a crazy situation brought about by the Government. It is totally anomalous &ndash; lose one's job and pay more tax, £42 a week to be precise. This reform will come back to haunt the Minister. Between now and the Finance Bill I will urge him to recognise the folly, stupidity and lack of sensitivity of what he has done and press him to correct this silly injustice.</P>
    <P>The Minister clearly was not thinking of real people, but of economic concepts and treating them as participating units in the workforce. These participants are real citizens struggling to meet real mortgages and despairing as they spend ever longer hours away from real children in ever more frustrating traffic chaos. The Government is out of touch with them. Real people listened to the Government's promises in the last general election. It promised initiatives to alleviate the cost of child care. They listened in 1997 during the general election and continue to listen in vain. Does the Government have any concept of what it is like to lift sleeping children out of their beds at 7 a.m. to be placed in a crèche and 12 hours later to inch through endless traffic jams to collect those same children with the hope of an hour with them before they go to sleep? The Minister can have no idea of what it is like to be with one's children only at weekends, otherwise he would have acted on his promise to help families with the burden of child care costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister celebrates the achievement of his fifth budget today while thousands of parents who believed his promises have been rebuffed. These same parents worry about the education of their children. It is a disgrace that Ireland is the sixth worst funder of primary education in the OECD. Congratulations, we are ahead of Mexico and the Czech Republic. Five years on we still have 20% of our children leaving primary school functionally illiterate. Is the Minister proud of this? Does he accept on recollection that he has done enough to provide the sort of resources that could achieve results as for instance in Finland &ndash; a country of commensurate size and wealth? Under the Government those with special needs must use the courts to secure the education of their children. In our primary classes today we have up to 1,000 unqualified teachers. Nothing has been done about this in today's budget, but there is yet another allocation of money in the hope of dealing with the capital issues in our schools.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister have any clue about the state of our primary schools of which 800 have applications in the Department of Education and Science for capital works? Some of them are an absolute disgrace where pupils and teachers work in Dickensian conditions. As an example, what comfort is the Minister's budget to the 140 pupils in St. Michael's national school in Mohill, County Leitrim, the building programme for which, <Col N="1336" /> which was due for completion next year, has been deferred indefinitely? This is unacceptable in a land of plenty and an indictment of the Government's incompetence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dabbled in the housing market in recent years. He cannot blame the Bacon reports for the situation as he added and subtracted from them. After five years of plenty with the Government there are now 120,000 on housing waiting lists, more than double the number when the Government came to office four and a half years ago. Its policies have added to the price of houses. Housing output has been reduced, rents in the private sector have increased by about 20% per annum while this generation has become the first in our history without the prospect of buying a home.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office the agricultural sector has approached an even more precarious level of decline. As the nation has prospered, agricultural incomes have stalled, growing by just 1%. Not only has the Government abandoned rural renewal, but by its inaction has promoted rural decline. Last week I visited County Donegal which has effectively five Government Deputies, including a Minister, but the national development plan treats the north western portion of the country as if it was the Sahara Desert. There is no major road proposed for that sector, no improvements in vital health services to eliminate the situation where many have to travel long distances to Sligo, Galway or Dublin for vital services and no university in the region. How can it overcome the problem of unemployment when it has been singled out for disregard by the Government, even though it has five Government Deputies? The people of County Donegal have been taken for granted.</P>
    <P>To compound these problems the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has seen its Vote cut by 15%, or 165 million, for 2002, this in a year when tourism, the other principal economic activity in rural Ireland, has been decimated. For 2002, as the tourism industry faces its worst year, the Minister in the Book of Estimates has cut the Bord Fáilte grant by 26%. He restores a few million pounds today, but it remains significantly cut. What is the logic of this when tourism needs more spent on it than in the past year? </P>
    <P>Under the Government county managers are encouraged by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to implement a planning regime so restrictive that the children of landowners cannot get planning permission to build houses on family land. This is the kind of policy that leads to rural depopulation, the closure of rural post offices and bank branches, and the disappearance of a way of life.</P>
    <P>Our national road system is a shambles. The two year old national development plan, with all its inadequacies, is already one year behind, thus the seeds of future economic growth remain unsown. In Dublin we have a perverse, one-dimensional traffic policy. Traffic lights are now <Col N="1337" /> erected, not to regulate traffic, but to frustrate and delay. Cycle lanes are often not an aid to cyclists, but a means of reducing lanes for motorists. Traffic islands, chicanes, one-way systems and widened footpaths are often provided for where they are not needed in an apparent attempt to deliberately cause traffic congestion. Twenty-four hour bus lanes are a self-evident excess, except in the context of driving motorists mad. Meanwhile, not one overpass or underpass is planned for Dublin city despite the fact that no other city of its size has solved its traffic problems without such facilities. This includes many cities which have been much more successful in moving people to public transport than is the case in Dublin. A man I admire, the environmental columnist of <i>The Irish Times, </i>is bound to disagree with my analysis, but how can true environmentalists think that a traffic policy that causes such gridlock and air pollution is good for the environment?</P>
    <P>The next government will bring forward the national development plan and build the roads needed to relieve the congestion. Where necessary, we will budget extra money to bring them to completion sooner. There is a sound economic and environmental case to be made for this. Moreover, there will be an urgent review of traffic policy in Dublin and in other cities to end the torturing of motorists and businesses alike who bear the cost of the present lunacy, which in Dublin is estimated to cost more than 1.25 billion a year. To cap it all, Deputy O'Rourke the Minister for Public Enterprise, has moved half of CIE's rail freight on to the roads.</P>
    <P>What have the Minister's five budgets achieved? I would say for those watching at home or listening in the cars stuck in traffic, that they do not feel any better off as a result of the Minister's largesse. After five years of his budgets, they spend at least one extra hour a day in traffic instead of with their loved ones. This Government's solution is to suffer for a further ten years and by then the national development programme will sort it all out.</P>
    <P>The rapidly falling output of housing is a clear signal that the Government's policies are failing. The traffic gridlock and the delay of almost every project under the national development plan is another indication of their failure. That the Minister's estimates for this year were 4,300 million out, also indicates the Government's failure. That the Minister has allowed expenditure to escalate beyond belief without achieving results clearly shows that the Government's policies are failing.</P>
    <P>More than that, one would complain less if, in the course of these five years, the Government had achieved social justice. I outlined the dirty dozen, 12 points in which the Minister and the Government have manifestly failed. However, there is hope. I assure the people at large that there is a Government in waiting and that it is a Government which will be dedicated to caring for the less well off and to achieving a just society. <Col N="1338" /> The power is in their hands and they will use it wisely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is a lie, a fraud and a disgrace. To balance the books, this Minister took money from the Central Bank &ndash; over which I shed few tears &ndash; but, more to the point, he has taken money illegally and disgracefully from the social insurance fund. The Members on the Fianna Fáil benches told me a year ago, when I suggested that we might defer some payment into the pension fund available from 2025 onwards, that I was raiding the fund. Yet their Minister for Finance has the gall to say here today that he will take 600 million from the fund which already exists, that he will for good reason take money from the fund provided by the workers and the employers.</P>
      <P>Until three or four years ago the social insurance fund was a fiction. It was basically part of taxation, but now we have one. It is a nest egg, a fund available for paying social insurance benefits, not notionally but legally as provided for in the Act. Deputy Cowen, as a lawyer, knows that. It is covered by the 1983 Act and is not the Government's to spend. It does not belong to Fianna Fáil nor the Minister to balance the books. It belongs to the pensioners and those who subscribed to it and it is there for a purpose. There is a straight trade-off between the pensions, the benefits, which we pay to people who need them, and the money he has taken away.</P>
      <P>He took it to save his blushes so that he can say, as he did frequently in his speech, that he did not have to borrow. It is a disgrace and a lie, and when the phone-call comes in tonight from our friends in congress, the Taoiseach will know all about it. The Minister is taking money to which he is not entitled from the workers of this country.</P>

      <P>Page D16 tells the real truth that we have a surplus this year of more than 100 million, but next year the full account of what happens this year comes into play. Next year we end up with an Exchequer borrowing requirement, or rather, a deficit, of 2,347 million, which is the figure that we should be examining today as it is the real cost of what the Minister has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the start of this year, as my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, already said, the Minister stated that he had a likely surplus of no less than 322 million. By the end of last week that had turned into a surplus of 323 million. If we strip out the once-off deals &ndash; the sale of TSB, ICC and the proceeds of the so called voluntary disclosure scheme &ndash; we are down to a real deficit of 600 million. In barely 12 months, the Minister has managed to turn a huge projected surplus into <Col N="1339" /> a deficit. A turn around of this kind in one year is flabbergasting and totally without precedent. The Minister has managed to lose an amount equivalent to the annual budget of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>This collapse is not just because of the events of 11 September or the foot and mouth disease crisis. The collapse in Government revenues is due in no small part to the mismanagement of the economy and, more particularly, to the way in which the Minister spectacularly lost the plot in last year's budget. In plain language, he blew it. He tore the guts out of the tax base at a time when he sought to raise spending by 20%. Far from a 12% increase in income tax this year, he will have less than last year. In a year when there may still be 6% or 7% economic growth, that is quite some achievement.</P>
      <P>The Minister has become the Fabien Barthéz of Irish politics. He likes doing his own thing. He is given to the occasional grand gesture but is always likely to drop the ball when the pressure really comes on. Like Monsieur Barthéz, the Minister rode his luck while the economy was doing well and people were prepared to forgive him the odd gaff &ndash; the credit unions, individualisation, the appointment of Mr. O'Flaherty, and so on &ndash; but like Fabien, the Minister's luck has run out and like his mentor, the Taoiseach has stood by for far too long and it is far too late to intervene. The chickens are coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>The most spectacular and immediate victim of the Minister's failure is his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. For years, as the several former Ministers for Health in the Chamber know, health looked for greater resources &ndash; more beds, nurses, consultants, nursing home places, better step down facilities, more investment in services for the mentally handicapped and the disabled. Above all, the Department sought greater investment in primary care and accident and emergency services. To be fair to him, Deputy McCreevy gave additional money, albeit reluctantly, but he has not ever accepted the basic core case put by health professionals and the Department that we need a quantum leap in funding to deliver the sort of service that people clearly want and to which they are entitled.</P>

Today, the Minister provided 400 million. These are big figures &ndash; 400 million in comparison to a ten year strategy costing 15,000 million. Barely 2% of the ten year strategy will be delivered in the first year. That tells <Col N="1340" /> us all we need to know about the Minister's commitment to the Government's health strategy. If the big figures do not tell the story, let us look at the details because some of them bear inspection. This is a ten year health strategy. The Minister talks about an additional 5 million or £4 million for mental health; 15 million or £12 million for primary care; 10 million for child welfare; and £5 million for cancer services.</P>

Over a ten year period, how could they possibly constitute a strategy which could ever add up to anything remotely close to 15,000 million? We should not be surprised by this because Deputy McCreevy has never been a fan of the health strategy nor has he been a particular fan of health service funding. We all know that. Two years ago he described the health service as &ldquo;a black hole&rdquo;. Earlier this year in Ballymascanlon, he derailed the plans of the Minister for Health and Children by making it clear that he had no intention of funding his colleague's grandiose plans. The Department of Finance was embarrassingly quick in contradicting the Minister for Health and Children's endorsement of the medical manpower report.</P>
      <P>The Minister's previous record pales in comparison to this pre-emptive strike against the health strategy when he introduced his own Estimates document on 15 November. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, made it clear that the so-called health strategy was not really a health strategy at all; he said is was &ldquo;no more than a collection of already existing programmes&rdquo;. More to the point, he went on to say that no new money would be provided unless or until economic circumstances allowed that. It makes one wonder what the point is of drawing up a ten year strategy. Surely the point of a strategy is to allow one to plan. Nobody believes that the number of acute beds can be increased overnight nor does anyone believe that the required number of health professionals can be recruited in one fell swoop. What is needed is a sustained and planned expansion and improvement in services brought about by structural reform and a steady increase in resources. The problem now is that the strategy has failed at the very first hurdle. Even if the little bit of extra money announced today is taken into account, the increase in the health budget this year is actually far less than it was last year. Of the 121 actions set out in the strategy announced last week, at least half will take additional money and most of that money simply is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an aspirational document the health strategy is worthy but with a few fundamental flaws. As a working policy in the hands of this Minister for Finance, it is a dead duck. For much of its term, this Government told us that there was no need for hard choices, that we could cut taxes and <Col N="1341" /> improve services at the same time. I recall the Taoiseach using that phrase more than once. However, when the Minister for Health and Children spoke in the House last week and last night, his tune had changed; suddenly there was talk of having to choose. Unfortunately for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the time to choose is already past. The Minister for Finance has already blown the resources needed to deliver the improvements in the health service which the public is rightly and vociferously demanding.</P>
    <P>The public is understandably cynical about the bona fides of a Government which produces a ten year strategy for the health services four and a half years into its term of office, in the clear knowledge that its failure to deliver a decent health service will be a telling issue in the impending general election. To produce a strategy without any commitment to fund it, not only into the future but right from the very start, really takes the biscuit.</P>
    <P>This failure to commit funding is of course most obvious in relation to the critical issue of access. For most of this Government's term the number of people entitled to medical cards has been falling. It is now under 30% and virtually all of those people are social welfare recipients. People on the minimum wage or part-time workers are ineligible despite the fact that they live on low wages. I am sure these people were heartened by the announcement in the strategy last week that the extension of the medical card would apply to some 200,000 people, only to have their hopes dashed a matter of hours later when it was announced that there would be no extension next year and for the period of office of this Government. Once again, it seems that the poor must wait.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure to address the issue of access in a serious way is a fundamental flaw in the health strategy. We have a two-tier system of health in this country whereby people with private insurance effectively pay to jump the queue. Priority is decided not by medical need but by ability to pay. At its core, our health system is fundamentally unfair. My party and our spokesperson on health, Deputy McManus, have made it clear that we will seek to address this by introducing a system of compulsory universal <Col N="1342" /> insurance where the premia of less well-off people will be partly or wholly paid by the State. The Minister for Health and Children rejected our proposals but told us at the same time that he does not like the two-tier system. In practice, the Minister is trying to have it both ways; he is telling those who do not have insurance that they will have equal access to health care while at the same time telling VHI and BUPA subscribers that they should continue to subscribe, notwithstanding the fact that the only reason most people subscribe to health insurance is to get preferential access. The Minister is saying contradictory things to different people. It is clear he has no intention of reforming the two-tier system, a fact which is unacceptable to me and to the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has often said that we should not judge him on just one budget, rather we should judge him over the course of his five years. Perhaps we should do that. At the end of his five years in office, public services are a shambles. He has singularly failed to bring about the sort of improvement required in infrastructure &ndash; be it roads, water services or transport. He has widened the gap between rich and poor in spite of having an unprecedented opportunity to do the opposite and has frittered away enormous sums of money in tax cuts which could have been used to produce lasting improvement in our quality of life.</P>
      <P>I do not dispute that Ireland is a wealthier place than it was ten years ago. The facts speak for themselves. National income <i>per capita</i> has risen from barely 80% of the EU average to above the EU average. GNP growth since 1994 has averaged about 8%. I do not dispute that this Government has contributed to those levels of growth, no more than I would expect them to suggest that we did not contribute when we were in office three or four years ago. I do not dispute that this Government has created wealth; my quarrel is about what they have done with that wealth. We had the opportunity, perhaps for the first time, to really transform this country. We could have given ourselves a health service to be proud of, a transport system that worked and well resourced schools and teachers. Instead we have hospital waiting lists that are longer than ever, teachers and school managers who waste time fund-raising, a road system which is increasingly dangerous and a public transport system which is, by any standard, simply not up to the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the seven years of boom, Irish people &ndash; or rather some Irish people &ndash; are major players in the property markets of Spain and France while anyone who lives in this city will spend hours every day getting to and from work or anywhere else they might want to go. In the national development plan published in 1999, the Government committed itself to fund a number of measures &ndash; some of them quite inexpensive &ndash; in the area of public transport. Most of those measures had been bandied around for some years. The DART signalling system was to be upgraded to allow the network to carry more <Col N="1343" /> trains but this has not happened. DART were to be extended to allow for longer trains at peak times but this has not happened either. I know all about this because I live in Clontarf, quite close to Killester DART station, and I see the queues of people who arrive there in the mornings. We were to have QBCs on all the major arteries into Dublin, only half of which are in place. The Government promised an integrated ticketing system in Dublin but this has not happened. Operation Freeflow is an embarrassment and is now referred to as Operation No Flow. The Government prevaricated for so long about Luas that it will be another two years before another tram is sighted on the streets of Dublin, assuming of course that the Taoiseach does not have them parked at street corners during the election campaign next year.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann is so strapped for cash that its safety programme is way behind time and there is no prospect of any improvement in services to its customers for the foreseeable future. So bad are things in CIE that a bridge on East Wall Road in my constituency, soon to be transferred to the Taoiseach's constituency, which was damaged six months ago, cannot be fixed for another six months because CIE does not have the money.</P>
    <P>The record on roads is hardly any better. Our primary roads are the worst in the European Union. Even Greece and Portugal, which at least on paper are poorer than we are, have a much better primary road system. The consequence of this failure to provide decent national roads is much more than simple inconvenience. There is not a single kilometre of motorway west of the Shannon or in the Ulster counties of the Republic and there is very little dual carriageway. This adds immeasurably to the difficulty of attracting foreign direct investment into those regions.</P>
    <P>Having to drive very long distances on national roads without any opportunity to overtake has made our roads infinitely more dangerous than they could be. We could and did live with this as long as the number of cars was below the EU average. Now there are about 250,000 more cars on our roads than five years ago. Conditions that were tolerable then have become intolerable and dangerous. During its five years in office, this Government has seen only 35 kilometres of motorway or dual carriageway completed. The national development plan is for 500 kilometres. Much of the rest of this is hardly beyond the planning stage and it is an open secret that the money needed to complete that plan will simply not be available. Even if it were available the money needed would overshoot the amount provided in the plan by at least 3 billion.</P>
    <P>The announcements made today were a bit of a damp squib. The NRA calculates it needs about 1.1 billion next year merely to give effect to the contracts currently in place. It will have an allocation of 600 million. This cutback of 500 mill<Col N="1344" /> ion will bring planning to a halt and means the programme will not be delivered on time.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the NRA has valiantly tried to play catch-up in recent years. However, to have any chance of delivering on the targets, would require certainty in relation to the Government's commitment on funding. On more than one occasion in recent weeks, the Minister has said the NDP is a flexible plan, which can be slowed down or accelerated as money becomes available. In this, the Minister could not be more wrong. The NRA can only enter into contracts if it knows the money will be there to meet those contracts. It cannot make plans if it does not know whether it will be able to pay for those plans. The NRA has finally managed to interest non-Irish contractors in some of the bigger projects, something that is utterly indispensable. If we are to do the business we must retain the interest of those contractors and we cannot do it if they cannot be sure the money will be available.</P>
    <P>The roads programme must be delivered on time using whatever funding mechanisms are needed, including borrowing. I know I am supported in this by those at the coalface, including the Construction Industry Federation. Any cutback or deceleration in the programme will send out all the wrong messages and will have serious consequences for the economy later on.</P>
    <P>If there is one defining difference between this PD/Fianna Fáil Government and the Labour Party, it is in our attitude to public services. The Minister has made his view clear and unambiguous on many occasions both before and during his tenure as Minister. He believes we should give people back money by way of tax breaks and they can look after themselves. He gave voice to that on the establishment of this Government's programme for government. At that time he committed the Government to reducing the fraction of national income spent on services over the term of the Government. It is no surprise he has delivered on that promise.</P>
    <P>It may surprise the Minister to hear we on these benches and many people in the country do not regard medical attention, nursing home care or education as mere commodities. Many of us regard the provision of these services as a mark of the sort of decent society in which we want to live. Many of us want to live in a country that provides services for everyone and not just for those who can afford them. We are willing to pay through our taxes and our social insurance for the provision of those services.</P>
    <P>Over his term in office, this Minister has cut taxes by too much and invested too little in services. Some of us, but not all of us, have more money in our pockets, but at the expense of worse public services and greater inequality than otherwise would or should have been the case. I acknowledge that many workers felt they were paying too much income tax and some relief was needed, but the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has gone much too far in the opposite direction. Many of the tax cuts, of which no doubt he is <Col N="1345" /> proud, have given little or no benefit to ordinary workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken six percentage points of the upper rate of tax, something that exclusively benefits the 23% of workers who pay tax at that rate. He halved capital gains tax. He has torn the guts out of capital acquisitions tax. He abolished probate tax. He has virtually abolished betting tax. He has virtually halved corporation tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know some of those measures were popular at the time, certainly for people paying those taxes. However, all of us must acknowledge the Minister's largesse comes at a cost that was spelt out most clearly and eloquently by the Minister for Health and Children last week in the House when he told us: &ldquo;Of course I would like to do more, much more, but the money is not there&rdquo;. The money is not there because the Minister for Finance has blown it. He squandered the money and the opportunity it gave because he did not and does not believe the provision of public services, using public money, is a good thing. Many of us will rue for a long time the fact that when the opportunity to transform public services finally came to this country, we had a Minister for Finance who was ideologically opposed to taking that opportunity.</P>
      <P>The one tax cut the Labour Party has consistently argued for in recent years is the removal of the first £183 or 232, the minimum wage, from the income tax net. As a society we have decided it is unconscionable that anybody should earn less than £183 per week. I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for their roles in this. Given that we have formed that judgment, it is unreasonable and illogical for the Government to take any part of that sum. In the past two years the Government has come round to that point of view. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have articulated that view, but it has not happened in the past and it did not happen today. The Minister fell far short of delivering it today.</P>
      <P>Is it not amazing that the one tax commitment that was demonstrably socially just and would clearly benefit the less well off to the best possible extent is the one that has fallen off the side of the table? The Government can do all it wants for corporation tax, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax, betting tax and probate tax, but it cannot take the minimum wage out of the tax net.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> Last weekend, on behalf of my party, I produced a statement that argued unambiguously in favour of borrowing this year. We should not be in that position. The Minister should not have cut taxes to the extent he did last year. He should not have sanctioned the daft savings scheme the total cost of which we still do not know. Most of all he should have allowed himself some flexibility in the long-term pensions reserve fund. I am sure members of the public are not too familiar with the pensions reserve fund, so I will try to explain what it is. The Minister looked at the experience of some European countries, principally the bigger countries such as France, Italy and Germany, saw they were struggling with their current pension liabilities and decided that since he had money left over he would set it aside for 2025 onwards. I did not disagree with that in principle because it seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to do. If one has money left over, then why not set it aside for a rainy day? However, it does not make sense to buy an umbrella and set it aside for a rainy day in a quarter of a century's time if it is already raining and one does not already have an umbrella. The Minister is proposing, not this year but next year and the year after if one looks at the figures in today's document, to instruct the NTMA to borrow on the open market and then to invest that money on the international equity markets. That defies common sense. I am not suggesting the fund should be abandoned or we should look to access the 8 billion which is currently in the fund, although I would be open to ideas on how it can be used productively before it is drawn down. I am suggesting that the Minister could and should have given himself and his successors room for manoeuvre when money is not as plentiful as it was as recently as last year.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend I re-read last year's budget speech by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who, unfortunately, is not here today. It was a wonderful piece of rhetoric. I had little problem with most of the rhetorical content. He spoke about true republican values and the importance of reducing inequality, particularly income inequality. The trouble is that he is living on a completely different planet from the Minister for Finance who calls the shots and signs the cheques.</P>
    <P>According to figures produced by Fr. Séan Healy of CORI, who is not a fan of the Minister and I am sure the Minister is not a fan of his either, income inequality has been hugely exacerbated during the Government's term. A large part of this increased inequality is the result of changes in income tax and social welfare introduced by the Government. CORI calculates that the gap in disposable income between a person earning £40,000 a year and an unemployed person has widened by £159 or 200 a week. This leaves us in the unacceptable and obscene position where relative poverty has increased at a time of unprecedented economic growth. It did not have to be that way. The Government could <Col N="1347" /> and should have benchmarked social welfare payments to gross average industrial earnings and raised payments as earnings increased. If it had done that, it could and should have virtually eliminated relative poverty during its term of office. Instead, the Minister for Finance has stoutly refused moves from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to benchmark and has disparagingly referred to anyone who makes the argument as the poverty industry.</P>
    <P>My party leader, Deputy Quinn, has set out the Labour Party's commitment to social welfare recipients. If we are given the opportunity by the people, we will benchmark the lowest social assistance rate to 30% of gross average industrial earnings and, thereafter, we will raise payments in accordance with wage increases calculated on a previous year basis. That can be done by 2004 at the latest and possibly by 2003. When we have done that, we will have eliminated relative poverty.</P>
    <P>The case of carers bears special mention. Many tens of thousands of people give freely and frequently of their time to look after elderly or infirm relatives. Many of these people are elderly. They are placed under huge strain by having to or choosing to spend virtually all their time looking after a family relative who cannot look after himself or herself. Some years ago the carer's allowance was introduced as an income support for people in this situation. The time is ripe to take a further step. We should move from the carer's allowance as a means tested income support to the carer's allowance as a positive recognition of the role and work done by carers. We should also explicitly recognise the self-evident fact that carers save the State a great deal of money which would otherwise be expended in publicly providing care for elderly people who need it. Accordingly, my party will, if given the opportunity, abolish the means test for the carer's allowance. We will also permit people who are already receiving another welfare benefit to receive up to half the carer's allowance in addition to their existing benefit or allowance. In addition, we acknowledge the need to provide carers with back-up help and respite assistance. For too long we have taken carers for granted. It is time to give them real recognition and tangible assistance.</P>
    <P>Before today, the Minister projected an accumulated surplus of 2,242 million in the social insurance fund. After his raid on the fund today and the relatively insignificant payments, he is talking about a surplus of 300 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had anticipated before I came into the House today that the Minister might do what he said he would do last year and introduce some reform of the PRSI system. With that in mind, I decided to give the matter some thought. Perhaps it might not do any harm to divulge some <Col N="1348" /> of my thoughts here today because they have a bearing on what the Minister has done. The first thing to acknowledge is that the system is a genuine mess. It is complicated to the point where it is virtually incomprehensible to the average worker. If one factors in the health levy, one would need to be an accountant or a sad person to make any sense of it. I acknowledge that is not entirely the fault of the Minister for Finance, although he did make things worse with his mini budget early in 2000. The first 127 of weekly income is exempt from PRSI for everyone and the first 287 is exempt, provided one does not earn more than that. If one earns more than 287 a week, then all the income is subject to PRSI. If one earns less than 347 a week, one does not pay the health levy, but if one earns more than 347 a week, one pays the levy on the entire income. If we factor in the ceiling of approximately 35,000 and the fact there are two different rates of employers' PRSI, it is an unholy mess. That, self-evidently, calls for simplification and reform.</P>
      <P>We should develop the insurance fund as a genuine insurance fund into which people contribute for defined benefits which they are entitled to expect in certain circumstances, whether unemployment, optical treatment benefit or old age pensions. My view, not that of my party, is that all workers should contribute something, however little, to the fund. Contributions should be simple and progressive. We must look seriously at the way the fund works. At present, as we found out to our cost today, the Minister can intervene and do whatever he likes. The stakeholders, the people who pay into the fund, do not have any rights. We need to establish the stakeholders as people who have rights. We need to put in place a board of trustees and we need to have representatives of the employers, of Government and of workers who will decide on changes both in terms of the contributions made into the fund and the payments made out of it or at least who will have a right as of right and as a bare minimum to be consulted. The total take in the fund should not be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of what the Minister has done today, perhaps I should elaborate on that last point. Irish social welfare benefits are much lower than the European average. That is largely because our rates of contribution are low. That may also have something to do with the fact that we traditionally compare ourselves to the United Kingdom whose contribution rates and benefit levels are also low. The time is now appropriate to move to a much better level of benefit, particularly for people who are long-term dependent on social welfare. It is not good enough in 2001 that we ask our senior citizens to live out potentially the last 20 or 25 years of their lives on £116 a week. The benchmarking commitment I mentioned earlier would bring that old age pension to 170 a week, although that is still not sufficient. We must ensure that we do this in a planned and affordable way. We must ensure it is affordable <Col N="1349" /> now as it is, or would have been before today, but we must also ensure it remains affordable as the population ages and in the event of a significant increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister reduced the level of employers' contributions to the social insurance fund. This sort of stuff is very frustrating. We have heard demands for months from employers to restore the ceiling for employers' contributions and PRSI, even though nobody has ever explained satisfactorily to me the reason there was a ceiling in the first place. We have heard employers demand that we reduce their contributions to the social insurance fund without any indication that any employer or employers' representative has thought about what the fund is for in the first place. Nobody has said that we should reduce or freeze old age pensions. This has been seen as just another tax break for employers. There is something very frustrating about what passes for public debate when that sort of thing can happen. I do not buy the employers' case. The percentage of national income taken by profits and capital has increased exponentially in recent years. According to the comparative figures for employers' PRSI contributions in European countries, ours are the second lowest. Surprise, surprise, the lowest contributions are required in the United Kingdom, but many other countries require employers to contribute to the social insurance fund at a rate well over twice that required by us. They do not just include the traditional social democratic countries of northern Europe, but also ones as diverse as France and Spain.</P>
    <P>There is no threat to Irish productivity which has been increasing year by year for as long as I can remember, certainly for the past ten or 20 years. There is no credible threat to competitiveness. We have reduced corporation profits tax by four percentage points in each of the last three years and will do so again next year. Our rates of corporation profits tax are, by far, the lowest in the European Union. They are so low that we are under increasing pressure from our colleague states to increase them. In that context where is the beef? I for one do not buy the employers' case and I am astonished that the Minister does. It is astonishing that he appears to be far more open to arguments such as this from employers than he is to arguments from those earning low pay.</P>
    <P>It has been a bad year for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. His musings on the electoral system came to nothing when the Taoiseach pulled the rug from under him on the matter of the dual mandate. He was forced to do an embarrassing U-turn on electoral funding. The issue I want to talk about today is that of climate change because, to my amazement, the Minister for Finance referred to it in the course of his speech. I have only a summary of the plan to deal with climate change produced by Government 15 months ago, but it refers to the following commit<Col N="1350" /> ment. The Government promised that from 2002 onwards taxes would begin to take into account the amount of greenhouse gas produced in any activity. Tax changes were to be phased in order that sectors could adjust incrementally. The reason I mention this is that we, in common with other EU countries, have been lambasting poor old President Bush for turning his back on the Kyoto Protocol. His was a disgraceful move, but it is crystal clear that the national climate change strategy the Government produced 15 months ago is not worth the paper on which it is printed. I have never heard the Minister, who as a member of Government committed to increasing carbon taxes from today on, utter a single syllable to suggest that he takes the strategy seriously. As recently as a few months ago he was one of only two Ministers in the European Union, his Spanish colleague being the other, who was opposed to carbon taxes. There is a case for increasing tax on carbon heavy energy. Hypothecated carbon taxes should and must be used for environmentally friendly energy such as renewable energy and public transport. This was accepted in theory by the Government 15 months ago, but, unsurprisingly, it has done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has today reversed almost everything he has done with regard to the property market in the last four years. I am not ashamed to say I supported some of the measures recommended by the Bacon report and some of the Minister's interventions in the market. I did so, largely, to give an opportunity to first-time buyers. To some extent what the Minister did was successful. His were never intended to be permanent measures, they were intended to take investors out of the market temporarily to facilitate first-time buyers by giving them a leg up and the advantage. That has been done. I am not convinced that the Construction Industry Federation reacted as we might have wished. There are clear indications that those in the construction industry who are hoarding land, or in a position to hoard options on land, have deliberately dried up the supply in an attempt to manage the market.</P>
    <P>There is simply no way to escape drawing the inevitable conclusion my party did some years ago that the State, or local authorities, or its house building agency, must get directly into the business of buying and securing land banks and dealing with them as they see fit. The Government's record on social housing was neatly summed up by the Taoiseach the day before yesterday. He acknowledged, explicitly, that despite the slow-down in the construction industry and the fact that fewer private homes are being built this year, the industry would not be taking up the slack in social housing. The national development plan committed the Government to 25,000 housing units over the course of its term of office, but it is now likely that less than half that number will be built. It is a shameful display and shows us exactly where the priorities of the Government lie.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> In just a few weeks we will witness the historic and unprecedented introduction of the single currency, when euro notes and coins will come into circulation. I pay tribute, as we all should, to the many here and throughout Europe who have worked long and hard in the last 12 years to ensure the vision of a single currency became a reality. The single currency has already demonstrated that it is a considerable success. We need only imagine what might have happened to the currency markets of Europe in the aftermath of 11 September if we had 14 separate currencies rather than one. Currency is ultimately a tool in the hands of business and consumers and it is in that light that it will be judged a success or failure after 1 January. There is a great onus on Government, the Director of Consumer Affairs and us all to ensure the introduction of the euro does not lead to rip offs which leave members of the public feeling they have been taken for a ride. That said, the event is an important one and I sincerely hope it goes well as I believe it will. The euro will define our economic future and the future management of our economy.</P>

Cinnte, tá sé ar chumas roinnt mhaith daoine an tarna saoire thar lear a chaitheamh i rith na bliana nó, b'fhéidir, buidéal níos daoire fíona a ól. Ach ó thaobh an chomhphobail de, ó thaobh áiseanna agus seirbhísí poiblí de táimid go léir thíos leis an méid atá déanta ag an Aire seo.</P>
    <P>Bhí deis aige, deis nach raibh riamh ag Aire Airgeadais go dtí seo forbairt agus feabhas thar cuimse a dhéanamh ar an gcóras leighis, ar an gcóras iompair phoiblí agus ar thithíocht shóisialta. Ach ní amhlaidh atá déanta aige. Sa bhliain seo, 2001, tá daoine fós ag fanacht blianta i gcomhair cóir leighis; tá níos mó daoine gan dídean ná mar a bhí le blianta agus tá easionannas ioncaim ag dul i méid i gcónaí.</P>

      <P>Today's budget will be remembered for the raid it made and the fraud committed. The Minister has not borrowed, but taken money from the social insurance fund and the Central Bank, and has no intention of giving it back. He had no right to take it and will rue the day, as will the Taoiseach, this precedent was established and accepted. I assure the Government that the two Bills required to give a veneer of legitimacy to what it has done today will be vigorously opposed by this side of the House.</P>

      <P>Thar cheann an Comhaontais Ghlas, fáiltím roimh an deis seo cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar cháinfhaisnéis na bliana seo chugainn. The budget shows more clearly than anything that the Minister for Finance, known outside and inside the House as Champagne Charlie, is drinking from a glass which has lost its fizz. That an exclusive diet of champagne will eventually kill a person is a reminder of the unhealthy way of life promoted by the budget. That champagne has to be imported is another reminder that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has neglected the potential of this country to become more self-reliant in food and energy. Instead, after five years of careless and inequitable Government, Ireland has become more reliant on fossil fuel and food imports and more than ever on inward investment. In other words, under the Government the people have become, for a range of reasons, more vulnerable. Some may be told they are invincible or even immortal. The fact is that all of us are faced with differing degrees of vulnerability, none more so than the people sleeping rough tonight in the streets around Leinster House. This is the legacy of the Government &ndash; vulnerability.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, commend the budget to the people when he has overseen in the past four years an increase of 60% in the numbers sleeping rough in Dublin alone? This is more than the combined numbers sleeping rough in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Nottingham and Oxford. During a period of unprecedented wealth in the State coffers, those most in need of help have seen their position worsen while those with sufficient wealth have grown increasingly richer. In the previous budget the Minister said he was happy for those over 70 to get a medical card. What use is that to the hundreds of people sleeping rough whose average age of death is 42 years? There is a clear need for a co-ordinating agency &ndash; we would like to call it Dídean, meaning shelter &ndash; to ensure services are delivered and progress is regularly reported to the Oireachtas on the area of homelessness.</P>
      <P>What is the response of the budget to the crisis in homelessness and housing which has thousands of families in scarce, sub-standard, over-priced rented accommodation? Why in this time of plenty when the coffers have been more than full have we been brought to a point where more than 125,000 people are on local authority housing waiting lists, which is more than 45,000 households, while just more than 4,000 houses were provided last year by local authorities and the voluntary sector? This is disgraceful. Focus has determined that just more than a third of new homelessness in Dublin is caused by evictions. Almost 20% of Dublin's homeless have a job, but can they afford or find housing? The answer clearly is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Estimates were published, I said the under capacity in the construction industry, which operates at 10,000 housing units under its peak of recent years, needs to be harnessed. If necessary, <Col N="1353" /> capital borrowing should be used to provide badly needed social housing. To help with this we certainly need a national housing agency. Inadequate as it may be, the Minister sees fit to boast about the number of houses built.</P>
    <P>However the energy efficiency of these new buildings is of a remarkably low standard compared to our European Union neighbours with similar climates. As a result, energy expenditure in inefficient households can exceed £1,000 per annum. The Irish Energy Centre has estimated households could save £75 million a year if they lived in energy efficient homes. However, the Government continues to charge the standard VAT rate of 20% on insulation and renewable energy installations compared with just 5% on such energy savers in the United Kingdom. Likewise, none of these new houses has been fitted with water meters or water saving measures. The Government is not just dining out on the inequality of present-day society but it is happy to sentence future generations to an almighty energy and resources shortage. To anyone concerned about resource management, the Government is a bunch of wasters.</P>
    <P>Such is the lack of concern for energy efficiency from the Government that almost a third of the paltry £6.1 million allocated in 2001 to energy conservation was not even spent, and the Sustainable Energy Bill still languishes awaiting Dáil time. If the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, thinks he can smile after clawing back £2 million not spent on energy conservation, then God help his successors and especially the younger and poorer in society.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented human build-up of greenhouse gases caused largely by burning fossil fuels has made climate change a reality for everyone, except the mandarins in the Department of Finance, it seems. The recent synthesis report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change has the following to say on the reality of what the country faces:</P>
    <P>Globally, the 1990s was the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental record. Observed changes in regional climate have affected many physical and biological systems, and there are indications that social and economic systems have been affected. The rising socio-economic costs related to weather damage and to regional variations in climate indicate increasing vulnerability to climate change.</P>
    <P>The same report shows that global costs of extreme weather events have increased 1000%, from an average of $4 billion per year in the 1950s to an average of $40 billion per year between 1990 and 1998, even when costs are adjusted for inflation over the same period. Insurers in Ireland can vouch for increased costs due to extreme weather at home, with costs for last year's flooding estimated to be as high as £40 million. These costs have already been passed on to Irish house<Col N="1354" /> holds, accounting for up to half the recent inflation in the price of household insurance.</P>
    <P>The Government's national climate change strategy referred to by Deputy McDowell promised the following:</P>
    <P>Government will put in place an appropriate framework for greenhouse gas taxation, prioritising COf8&gt;2 emissions from 2002 [basically, next month] on a phased incremental basis and in a manner that takes account of national economic, social and environmental objectives.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, it is clear the Government is not just intent on wasting energy but is intent on ignoring its own climate change report, and wasting paper as well in the process.</P>
    <P>Climate change will not be tackled by a random rise in excise duty. What is needed is a comprehensive shift away from reliance on income tax to a tax system designed to conserve finite resources with the necessary waivers and compensatory payments to avoid fuel poverty and disadvantage. The Government's national climate change strategy specifies that this should be decided in consultation with the social partners. For reasons best known to this Government and previous ones, environmental interests are not represented within this process. The stark reality is that ignoring measures which are needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will devastate future budgetary provisions. Climate change is a disaster which is beginning to happen for the insurance industry, farmers, tourism, and especially for the poor, the homeless and those whom the Government would prefer to ignore.</P>
    <P>What the Government does not ignore is the interests of its wealthy supporters in the building industry. The public private partnerships mentioned in the Budget Statement need to be understood for what they are. The Minister told us that, in the next three years, 80 million will be the private contribution to the infrastructure programme. What the Minister really means is that private money will be invested with the certainty that it will be repaid with a large profit for the investor. Who will repay this money? It will be consumers once again, and the poorest consumers as well as those with wealth. This is the most perverse form of social exclusion available to any Government and it will hurt the poorest most. Not only is the Government reneging on its responsibility to provide public utilities and infrastructure, it is raiding the social insurance fund for 635 million so that the next generation will have less for social needs and pensions while having to pay for the use of the infrastructure at the same time.</P>
    <P>Carers will get little comfort from this budget. The reality of hardship will continue for widows or widowers, who are also carers, with a large family which may include a child with special needs. Such people, and I know a number in this situation, will continue to be faced with Hobson's choice &ndash; to opt either for a widow's pension or <Col N="1355" /> a carer's allowance &ndash; because the Government will not allow such disadvantaged families to have both. Such citizens have a tough life already and are helped little by this budget. If such persons depend upon public transport, little will change, especially if they are living in rural areas. Instead, the Minister is pushing ahead with motorway plans as a priority at the expense of public transport needs. The National Development Plan envisaged an inequitable 2:1 ratio favouring road building over public transport. After today's budget, we will have even greater inequality with a 2.5:1 ratio.</P>
    <P>The private investor is being relied upon to provide public transport infrastructure, but when will the Minister realise that park-and-ride facilities and student housing are considered as public capital projects in inclusive, equitable societies elsewhere in the EU? Even if a private investor does come to the rescue of this hapless Government, the facilities will be costly for the consumer in the long-term and, in the case of student accommodation, can be taken back after ten years.</P>
    <P>Not only those requiring student accommodation feel let down by the budget. Others in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of education are also left with little to celebrate. Their best option is fund-raising.</P>
    <P>The situation that gave rise to the Synott case still faces parents of children with special needs. Equally unforgivable is the squandering of public resources in the privatisation of public utilities and infrastructure. Is it not strange that large sums of public money can be written off in consultancy fees and preparations for selling off State assets, such as Aer Lingus, while at the same time, workers in Aer Lingus are being threatened with redundancy because the Government decides not to challenge the EU Commission's State aid rules? The favouritism shown to privatisation policies permeates each policy area touched by the Government.</P>
    <P>Even in the health service, the Government stands idly by as some GPs turn their backs on local communities and announce doctor-on-call schemes which require ordinary people to go without an after-hours medical service. They have no choice but to get a taxi to a hospital up to 12 miles away, as in the case of my own town of Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>Sectors which are not easy to privatise, generally lose out even more to this Government. This has a devastating effect on the most vulnerable in our society &ndash; those in the caring professions, the poor and the homeless, as well as the environment generally, including wildlife and those who care for animals. Volunteers at the Irish Seal Sanctuary are being cut off social welfare unless they walk away from their responsibilities and give up voluntary work in order to find so-called paid employment. This is all happening in what has been called the year of the volunteer.</P>
    <P>Mahatma Gandhi put it better than anyone <Col N="1356" /> when he said that, &ldquo;The greatness of a nation must be judged on the way it treats its most vulnerable citizens and its animals&rdquo;. It is clear that the Government stands indicted by that yardstick.</P>

    <P>(6) THAT the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, be amended as on and from 5 December 2001 in Schedule 29, column 1, by inserting &ldquo;section 730FA(2)&rdquo; before &ldquo;section 730G(2)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(7) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This Resolution implements the announcement of the Minister for Finance on 26 September last concerning changes to the tax treatment of personal portfolio life assurance policies. By way of background assistance to the House, the personal portfolio life assurance policies are a particular type of life policies which allow investors, with the assistance of life assurance companies, to place personal investments within a life asssur<Col N="1366" /> ance policy. This is referred to as the wrapping of personal investments in a life policy and hence the term commonly used for these products, namely, &ldquo;wrappers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With traditional life assurance investment products, the insurance company uses its professional expertise and discretion to invest funds on behalf of policyholders collectvely. However, there is no element of a collective investment in these wrapper products. Essentially, such a life policy is a contrived vehicle to allow the investor to gain access to take a tax advantage. The tax advantage which arises in access to the gross roll-up tax regime came into effect for domestic life assurance companies on 1 January 2001. Briefly, this means that the income in gains accruing in respect of the assets underlying a life policy are allowed to grow or roll up tax free over the duration of the policy. Tax is only imposed when a policyholder cashes in or withdraws funds from the policy. When this happens the profit on the policy, that is, the accrued income in gains, is liable to a flat exit rate of 23%. By placing selected personal assets in a personal portfolio, life policy investors could before the Minister's announcement of September last, limit the taxation of income and gains from those assets to a flat 23% and, furthermore, could defer the tax liability until the policy was cashed in or funds withdrawn from it. In addition, no liability to PRSI or levies would arise. If a high income policyholder invested directly, the tax charged on the income arising from the investment would be 42% per annum.</P>
    <P>The resolution imposes a 20% surcharge on the profits from a personal portfolio life insurance policy. The surcharge will apply on top of the existing 23% exit tax and will apply to the proceeds of such policies paid out of life assurance companies on or after 26 September last in accordance with the statement of the Minister on that day. A 20% surcharge on top of the existing exit tax should neutralise any tax advantage from wrapping personally selected assets in a life policy, given that the top rate of income tax is 42% and the profits from personal portfolio policies will often be a mixture of income and capital gains.</P>
    <P>The details of the resolution are set out. As the Minister said in his budget speech, he has closed off these loopholes through which the well off could reduce their taxable incomes. The personal portfolio policies are an abuse of the gross roll up tax regime for life companies. I, therefore, commend the resolution to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be relevant, although as a good friend of mine would say, &ldquo;looking at this <Col N="1367" /> resolution code is like looking into a bush&rdquo;. I hope I will not be repetitious.</P>
      <P>I will take the Taoiseach at his word in the explanation he gave us of this ingenious method of wrapping. As the Taoiseach will know, I have a long history of being well intentioned towards means of plugging loopholes in our tax system.</P>
      <P>A few issues, however, occur to me. I note there is a definitions section in this resolution and it defines many of the operative phrases but it does not define the term &ldquo;property&rdquo;. I take it that property in this resolution can mean real estate or cash. The first place the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; occurs on a quick reading of the resolution is in the proposed subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(i). Would it not have been useful to define the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; in the earlier part to put the matter beyond doubt because I inferred the meaning of the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; on reading through the provision?  </P>
      <P>In subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) of the proposed 730BA, there is a reference to the insurance company appointing an investment adviser irrespective of how such a person is described. Why is it necessary to be so unclear about that? Is there not an accepted definition of who is an investment adviser or what kinds of creatures are regarded as investment advisers?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said this measure is intended to apply a special extra rate of taxation to funds coming from wrappers. I gather the tax arises when they are unwrapped.</P>
      <P>The first reference to a rate is a formula of &ldquo;(S + 3) per cent&rdquo; where S is the standard rate. Is that the standard rate of taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, &ldquo;(S + 3) per cent&rdquo; would be 23%.</P>
      <P>The provision on page 6, which modifies section 730F of 1997 Act, provides that where the chargeable event falls on or after 1 January 2001, the charge is at 23%. Where the chargeable event falls on or after 26 September 2001, the charge is S plus 23%. Do I take it that means 46% and that is where the penalty begins to apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 43%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 43%. I take it my understanding is correct.</P>
      <P>At the bottom of page 8, under section 6, there is a provision that an inspector may at any time amend or further amend an assessment. This is followed by a subsection which allows an inspector to make an assessment without giving notice of the assessment or any of those normal requirements.  Why is it necessary to propose that an inspector can have a second or even a third bite at the cherry? Is that not a slightly unusual provision? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 10, the provision that amends section 730J of the 1997 Act, provides for a tax rate of H plus 20% where H is a rate determined in relation <Col N="1368" /> to the person by section 15 for the year of assessment in which the payment is made. Is that a penalty rate or which part of that is the penalty rate? Am I right in assuming that 20% in that formula is the standard rate and the H is a penalty rate assessed or determined for the person in question for that year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach might like to answer those questions first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Dukes's last question, that would not necessarily be a penalty rate; it could be the standard rate or a higher rate.</P>
      <P>There is no standard definition for an investment adviser. There is nothing more than that in not including such a definition.</P>
      <P>Property includes everything, real estate and cash. That is deliberately done, otherwise something might be left out. The phrase &ldquo;further amend&rdquo; is normal terminology in the tax Acts.</P>
      <P>It might help clarify the position if I were to read into the record a part of the speaking note that I did not read. The personal property portfolio is defined in broad terms as a policy which allows a policyholder to select or to influence the selection of the assets which determine the policy benefits. However, the policy will not be regarded as being a personal portfolio policy where the only property may be selected. The property involves, property consisting of units in a unit trust or similar undertakings, property allocated by an assurance company to an internal fund in order to fund policy benefits, cash or a combination of any of these.</P>
      <P>These exceptions only apply provided the opportunity to select the property concerned is widely available to the public at the time the property is available for selection by the policyholder and this wide availability must be evident in published, marketing or promotional material published by an assurance company. To ensure that exceptions cannot be exploited and the surcharge avoided, some additional requirements will apply to policies commenced or marketed from today.</P>
      <P>The additional requirements are that the assurance company must deal with everyone interested in selecting the property on a non-discriminatory basis. Where the property to be selected is primarily land and buildings and the assurance company is seeking to raise a predetermined amount in investments, each investment made by a policyholder would be limited to 1% of the amount being sought by the assurance company. That spells out the definition of property which Deputy Dukes raised and I hope it makes the position clearer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has no problem with closing off a clearly defined tax loophole that was identified and on which an announcement was made on 26 September. What concerns me, and perhaps the Taoiseach or his advisers may be able to offer some clarification, is that the resol<Col N="1369" /> ution is more than just a resolution. It is the insertion of substantial legislation into the existing consolidated tax legislation. Can I take it that when the Finance Bill proper comes to be debated, this resolution will be in the Finance Bill, 2002, and that if there are any technical changes or anything else comes to light between now and then, the normal Committee Stage process will be available to the House at that time? If that is the case, and I gather from the way the Taoiseach is reacting that it is the case, I am prepared to accept the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct. In the normal course of events, the Minister's statement would stand until the publication of the Finance Bill and while some people were using and abusing this loophole, others were not, so this measure is by way of clarification and to give certainty now rather than waiting for the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will form part of the later discussion, but so that the people involved know what is and is not included, and what side of the line they might or might not be on, the view was taken to do it this way, which is effectively a Finance Bill section as drafted, to provide that clarity and certainty.</P>

      <P>One of the new conditions that will be applied, if I understood it correctly, is that in the selection of the property, which has to be open indiscriminately to the general public, no one person may select more than 1% of the property.

    <P>Financial Resolution No. 2 provides, with effect from midnight tonight, for increases in mineral oil tax on petrol and auto diesel. These increases, when VAT is included, amount to 5p, or just under 6.4 cent, on a litre of petrol and auto diesel. As signalled, it is also proposed for environmental reasons to increase the rate on auto diesel with a higher sulphur content by a further amount of 5p, or 6.54 cents inclusive of VAT, from 1 March next by which time the trade should be able to complete the transition to the lower sulphur product. Irish petrol and diesel rates are now among the lowest in the European Union, and prices at the pumps have also fallen over the past 12 months by an average of 10p for unleaded petrol and 16p for auto diesel. It is considered that there is scope for an increase at this time. An additional increase of 5p is supplied to substitute auto fuels to keep in line with the rate of tax on auto diesel.</P>
    <P>The resolution also provides for an increase of 2.5p, or 3.17 cent, inclusive of VAT, on aviation gasoline for use by aircraft other than commercial aircraft where no excise applies. These increases are expected to result in additional Exchequer yields of £7.4 million, or 9.4 million, this year and £168.5 million, or 214 million, next year. The effects on the CPI will be an increase of 0.336%.</P>

      <Col N="1374" /> Resolution No. 3 provides for excise duty increases on tobacco products with effect from midnight tonight which, when VAT at 20% is included, amounts to an increase of 10p, or about 13 cent, on a packet of 20 cigarettes, with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products. The increase is expected to yield £0.7 million, or 0.9 million, this year and £29.3 million, or 37.1 million, in a full year and to increase the CPI by an estimated 0.149%. It is expected that the increase in price will reduce projected consumption by 0.7% compared to what it would otherwise have been. The Government remains very concerned about smoking and its impact on health and the increase may help discourage smoking, particularly in younger people.</P>

    <P>Resolution No. 4 provides, with effect from midnight tonight, for an increase of excise duty on cider and perry and when VAT is included, it amounts to about 21p, or 27 cent, per pint of ordinary strength cider per yield, bringing the excise duty on these products broadly into line with VAT levy on beers. In relation to its alcohol content, cider and perry have been significantly under taxed for many years compared to beer. The expected yield from the increase, which will take effect from midnight tonight, is approximately 33.6 million, or £26.4 million, in a full year. The measure will not have a significant effect on the CPI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>From memory, I believe the Minister said this afternoon that the effect of these three rate increases will be to add 0.9% to the CPI. I will deal with them in the order in which they appear on our paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolution No. 2 concerns duty on mineral oils. In common with most other people on this side of the House this evening, I felt like laughing, if it were no so serious, when the measure, particularly the part dealing with diesel with a sulphur content above 50 parts per million, was presented as an environmental measure. It is the only measure in the budget which could be classified as environmental by a great stretch of the imagination. As Deputy McDowell said, if this is the extent of the Government's commitment to environmental action, God help us. We have no <Col N="1376" /> right to condemn President Bush for giving the back of his hand to the Kyoto accord.</P>
    <P>I oppose the increase in excise duty on fuels. It will raise only a very small amount of money in the context of the total budget, which at any rate will fall apart very rapidly. It is built on shifting sands. Given how calamitously wrong the Minister and the Government got the budget for 2001, I do not have the slightest confidence that the parts of the budget strategy announced this afternoon will hang together in 2002. My firm expectation is that the first brief the incoming Minister for Finance will receive from the Department after the next election, which is only a matter of months, if not weeks, away, will be an account of how and why the budget strategy for 2002 went off the rails. One of the first tasks facing the incoming Government will be to look very closely at how to address this matter because this budget will fall apart as surely as the health strategy announced a few days ago falls apart. The budget's provisions on health torpedoed the health strategy.</P>
    <P>It is not right to saddle motorists with a 5p per litre increase in the price of petrol, a 5p per litre increase in the price of diesel and a 10p per litre increase in the price of high sulphur diesel. If I had some degree of confidence that the budget would work or do something worthwhile, I might accept the need to pay a price for it, including an increase in excise duties on petrol. However, with the budget set to fall apart, no such case can be made.</P>
    <P>As the budget will create widespread disappointment and disillusionment, the increases would not be justified. They will add to the daily burden, particularly of those who live in rural areas and have no option but to use private cars, because buses are not available across huge areas of the country thanks to the indolence of the Minister for Public Enterprise. The other day I received a report on the rural transport initiative. While I am aware a few things are moving in some areas, progress is only a shade faster than the Luas which has once got as far as a static carriage on a static track in Merrion Square. The project should have been up and running by now. Had the original plans been adhered to, it would be. Given all these factors, I see no convincing reason to vote for the increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel oil.</P>
    <P>I turn to the measure on tobacco products. The politically correct stance would be to state that one cannot object to 10p on a packet of cigarettes. Many would argue for a greater increase. We all heard the stories making the rounds in recent days that the price of cigarettes would rise by 1. The more well informed pundits, as they like to think of themselves, told me last night that the 1 story was designed to scare the living daylights out of people and that the rise would be 0.5. It now transpires the increase is 10p. This, together with the fuel, is of a piece with the weird lack of conviction in this year's budget. It does not contain a good environmental tax on petrol <Col N="1377" /> or diesel or a really good, dissuasive tax on cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach informs us the effect of the increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes will be to reduce consumption by 0.7% below what it would otherwise have been. Why bother? The 10p increase contrasts sharply with some of the other Government plans for cigarettes. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, will require retailers to keep cigarettes locked away from public gaze in a cabinet under the counter and make it an offence to have any promotional or advertising material on display in their shops. They will also be required to pay a registration fee. It provides that retailers who commit an offence of displaying such materials, allowing a customer to see a packet of cigarettes before purchase, or selling cigarettes to those who are under age, may lose their registration for three months up to, I believe, one year. They will have to say goodbye to typically about 20% of their total trade for this period. This is madness.</P>
    <P>I will have a lot more to say when we debate the Bill. I will not be politically correct and have never been known to be particularly politically correct. I hate nonsense when I see it. For the Government to persistently state it is concerned about cigarette smoking, an activity I would not recommend to anybody, and introduce a half-hearted measure such as this is, in the seanfhocal words, neither fish, flesh nor good red herring. Is it worth the bother, especially when it will raise so little money in the context of a budget as unstable and ramshackle as this? </P>
    <P>The resolution on cider and perry will clearly create many protests in County Tipperary. We will all be inundated with more lovely red and green presentations from the cider industry council complaining about it. I cannot find it in my heart to get particularly excited about the measure one way or the other. I have a feeling that the amount of perry consumed has substantially diminished in recent years. I may be wrong as I am not a perry drinker. There are some cider drinkers in the House, although, as the Taoiseach would know, they have very little in common with those who consume cider in public parks.</P>
    <P>To introduce an increase of 5p a litre on fuel, particularly in the context of such a chancey budget, is an excessive imposition, especially on those with no access to public transport. Increasing the price of cigarettes by 10p will not satisfy anybody, including those seeking muscular action to deter or reduce smoking, and it will not make a hap'orth of difference to those, among whom I will probably number myself, who will complain about it.</P>

      <P>If there was rationing, that might have a real effect on me. We will complain about it for a few days and then we will forget that we ever bought cigarettes for £3.82 a packet. I cannot <Col N="1378" /> believe the Government is really serious in coming forward with this.</P>
      <P>It would have been different if, instead of raiding every cache of money in sight, the Government said we would have real measures on indirect taxation in order to raise money for worthwhile social spending. That would have been an argument that I would have liked to have but that is not what it is doing.</P>
      <P>With these measures it is raising what is in the context of this budget, a piddling unimportant amount of money for a budget which will do very little in any real sense for people.</P>
      <P>For example, if one analyses what is provided for health in this budget and compares the true position post-Budget 2002 with the true outturn position for 2001, which the Government has sedulously avoided presenting to us, one will find that the extra amount of expenditure for health in 2002 over 2001 is about £100 million. This is in the context of what is supposed to be a £10 billion health improvement programme over ten years. It is ludicrous. It is worse than just nominal. Therefore, these tax increases are of a nature where I am surprised that the Government has the neck even to bother the House with these resolutions.</P>

      <P>The hard pressed motorists in this jurisdiction are cornered in every respect. From the first demands in relation to licence fees to vehicle registration tax, motor tax and increasing excise duty on fuel. We have a situation in the vast swathes of this country, where people are totally dependent on private transport, the personal or family car. I come from a part of the country where there is to all intents and purposes no public transport system. Apart from the main expressway service from Letterkenny and Derry to Dublin, we have no internal public transport system within the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. We have no rail network. There is total dependency on car transportation. In these circumstances which one finds throughout the length and breadth of this jurisdiction people are being further pressed once again by this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For freight transport, we also see a dependency on the use of the road infrastructure. All transport of goods to these parts of the country that are not serviced by public transport by rail or other means of distribution of goods and services, are also facing this further hike. The result of that, in turn, is that these additional costs, in terms of service and goods distribution, will be added on to the already increased burden on the <Col N="1379" /> ordinary consumer and on the road dependent motorist. There is, in a further Resolution, the re-introduction of the 21% standard rate of value added tax. In reality, we will see &ndash; of course it is all very convenient with the advent of the euro &ndash; that there will be great confusion but it will be very noticeable in the purses of hard pressed families at the end of each week that they have lost out and have been penalised further.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that while the Taoiseach has said we have one of the lowest rates of excise duty on petrol and diesel within the European Community, for many years the situation was very different. Petrol retailers in the Border counties were closed. Whole communities and towns in my constituency had no petrol or diesel retail outlets, and it is only in recent years with improved economic circumstances that some of these have re-opened and that we see a thriving local economy based in no small measure on the influx of people from north of the Border attracted by the very competitive pricing for petrol and diesel south of the Border. People in other retail outlets also benefit from this traffic and from this spending power visiting our respective towns and villages along the Border's length. It would be a very sad message that this budget brings to those people dependent on that business, looking forward to a thriving business market in the lead up to Christmas and continuing in the new year.</P>
    <P>I urge the opposition of this House to the proposal before us. It is unnecessary, it is punitive and it lacks imagination. What the Minister needed to do was allow the opportunity for an equalisation after years of hardship, marginalisation and economic depression, particularly in the Border counties. We needed a period of time of stable opportunity to build, to root and to anchor. Instead we have further punitive excise duty charges being placed at the petrol pumps. This affects everybody. There is no service, there are no goods and there is no activity within these areas, totally dependent on our road infrastructure, that will escape. There is no alternative. I would ask the Taoiseach to take on board the very damaging effects of this measure, particularly in the areas I have described. I record my opposition and will vote against this measure in the House tonight.</P>

      <P>Can I just clarify, because I missed it when it was read out by the Taoiseach, what the yield is in relation to Resolution No. 2 and Resolution No. 3? I have a yield of 33 million for Resolution No. 4. Perhaps the Taoiseach might indicate what the yield is for the other two.</P>

      <P>The increases expected on Resolution No. 2 will result in yields of £7.4 million or 9.4 million this year and £168.5 million or 214 million next year. On Resolution No. 3, the expected yield is £0.7 million or 0.9 million this <Col N="1380" /> year and £29.3 million or 37.1 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In total, then, we are looking at approximately just more than 300 million in a full year. My party is opposed to these Resolutions. The increase on cigarettes is not sufficient to have the deterrent effect which one would like to see. I would like the Taoiseach in his response to indicate how he feels about the impact on inflation having regard to what happened last year and how the Government may be constrained by the inflationary impacts the increase on cigarettes may have and, therefore is only looking for an increase of 10p. That increase is derisory at one level, bearing in mind that the figure of 1 did not get into the media unassisted. Somebody had to put it in there in the first instance. If the Minister was serious about raising money from the cigarette and tobacco smokers, he would look for something more than the 10p proposed. Maybe the Taoiseach might outline the thinking of the Cabinet and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. That Minister no doubt would have liked to have got more resources &ndash; he said so here in the House &ndash; and this was one obvious way. Even smokers would accept that 10p is not much of a deterrent for people who put their health at risk and become a direct burden on the health infrastructure, as is evident from many studies. It may be that, in the light of recent revelations, the Minister does not wish to enhance the prospects for cross-Border smuggling. Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain why he has bothered to add only ten pence. Why not opt for a much larger figure?</P>
      <P>The fuel increase adds insult to injury for the many people who are forced to drive or, in many cases, forced not to drive when they are stalled in gridlock, as we saw with the &ldquo;no-flow&rdquo; situation in Dublin city two days ago. This will result in quite a substantial increase in the operating costs of many companies which depend on fuel. The Minister may reply by saying he has reduced some other costs for companies such as the inexplicable reduction in PRSI, which as Deputy McDowell said earlier was neither signalled nor sought. This is a bonanza for employers on top of the bonanza they are already getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to elucidate some philosophical underpinning or strategic economic thinking behind this. On the one hand there are reductions in revenue from employers' PRSI and, on the other, there is an effort to increase revenue. I cannot understand why there is a need to reduce employers' PRSI which is already the lowest, or close to being so, in the EU. We clearly have a competitive economy. Companies' profit levels are comparatively high and taxation is far and away the lowest in the EU. Why reduce revenue in one area where there is no manifest demand for it? I have not seen any demand from employers' organisations for a reduction in PRSI. I have, however, seen a demand for the resti<Col N="1381" /> tution of the state of affairs which existed prior to last year's budget, when unannounced changes were introduced without any consultation in total contrast to the spirit of social partnership whereby changes in the tax system were signalled or negotiated in order that people would, at least, not be surprised by their imposition.</P>
    <P>Together with a reduction in substantial revenues, there is a gratuitous increase in fuel revenues. This cannot be seen as a carbon tax, as advocated by the Green Party and others, because of its relative impact. The increase is 5p per litre in metric terms or 25p per gallon. Given that petrol costs about £3 per gallon the impact will not be large. Patterns of behaviour will not be distorted and hence it is pointless as a carbon tax. The rationale behind this is not clear. Was the Minister so ashamed by how much he had stolen from the social insurance fund that he felt obliged to put some veneer of respectability on this robbers' budget by raising some taxes?</P>
    <P>The people of south Tipperary have received a vindictive, two-fingered tax. They are being punished for humiliating Fianna Fáil not once, but twice, in by-elections. We are all intimately acquainted with the relatively small Irish company which sources and produces product in that part of south Tipperary. Every Deputy in this House knows it as we have driven past it on numerous occasions. The one thing it did wrong was not to vote for Fianna Fáil on two separate occasions and it is now being penalised for this in a childlike manner. To suggest that taxes are being harmonised to bring them up to the same level as the rate of tax on beer does not wash. Why is this being done? No doubt Deputy Healy will have his own interpretation of the reasons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes is correct. In previous years we received representations from the Cider Industry Council about the demonisation of cider. Its members felt that cider was being represented as a drink which is only consumed illegally by underage youngsters in parks and which causes anti-social behaviour. The Government is saying very clearly to a constituency which has humiliated Fianna Fáil&mdash;</P>

Deputy McDowell found the fault line. The Government could have chosen another course but instead it has announced these three measures. One of them is vindictive and another will not have a deterrent effect on the consumption of tobacco. The third is an imposition on the general population and on employers specifically because that is where they will be able to say there is a cost problem &ndash; they have already had a reduction in their PRSI. The Government has foregone income on the employers' PRSI without providing any explanation or rationale and now it intends to hit all the people who depend on their own transport, either in freeflow or no-flow, to pay for it. There is no logic behind what the Government is doing. I am opposed to all three measures.</P>

If my calculations are right, <Col N="1386" /> the difference is that the petrol price in Northern Ireland is some 38p higher than it is here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to keep my contribution short. The price increase on cigarettes is the greatest joke I have ever heard. I say to the Minister for Health and Children that the 10p put on cigarettes will encourage people to smoke. It is the Minister's job when sitting around the Cabinet table to say &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo; to what affects his Ministry. When there was mention of adding 1 to a pack of cigarettes, young people told me that they would stop smoking. The 10p added will only encourage them to smoke and it is a disgrace as far as smoking is concerned. It will do nothing to encourage people not to smoke.</P>
      <P>Another question I want to raise is the increase of 5p per litre on oils. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, spoke about taking people out of the tax net. Will he consider the numbers of people working at £6 per hour? Many live in country areas where they may have to drive up to 20 miles to work. The increase of 5p per litre and the 1% VAT amounts to 27p per gallon. For those people earning £250 or £300 a week that is just the limit. They will lose out because of that increase. The tax concession they get on a £250 salary is approximately £5 per week. So much for the Minister taking people out of the tax net. The truth is he is giving them a tax concession on their salary but he has taken it back in the cost of their petrol and diesel. These people have to drive to work and on the worst roads in Ireland in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point concerns the motorist. I said to the Taoiseach that the Government consistently went back to the motorist for finance. The Government has now charged the motorists 250 million extra in any full year as a result of <Col N="1387" /> imposing this 5p per litre. These people are paying duty when they purchase a car, then they are paying petrol tax and road tax. Time and again the Government has gone back to the motorist. It is all right for those who live near work or those who can use public transport. In my Wexford constituency the majority of people drive to work day after day and this imposition of 27p extra per gallon will use up whatever tax concession they got.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being taken from the motorist is not being channelled back into the proper areas &ndash; the county roads. We have approximately 700 miles of the worst county roads in Ireland. Unfortunately the county manager says he cannot get the money from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. Now the Government is coming back to the motorists for another 240 million a year and people are still left driving on bad roads. It is an imposition as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly oppose Financial Resolution No. 4. I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to withdraw this Resolution because it puts 500 jobs in the cider and perry industry at serious risk. Most of those are based in Bulmer's in Clonmel. I was surprised and disappointed to hear Deputy Dukes say that he could not become excited about that. The majority of those in the cider industry will be excited by this savage increase of 21p per pint. They believe that their jobs are at risk and I agree. This is a home grown industry which has developed since it was started by Magners in Clonmel in the 1930s. We all seek the development of indigenous industry, yet this increase savages just such an industry. Cider had an image problem but is now a very up market quality drink. This increase will affect employment in an industry which has also developed the production of apples throughout the country as 90% of cider apples are grown here giving employment to small farmers, particularly in the south east. No account was taken of the fact that this is a labour intensive and costly industry compared to beer production. I remind the Minister that most beers are imported. The rate of yield of this increase in 2002 will be 36.6 million.</P>
      <P>The next item is a reduction from 5% to 2% in betting duty, almost equivalent to the increase in duty on cider. Has the Minister's pet hobby taken over the Book of Estimates? If this goes ahead, it will have an adverse affect on employment in Tipperary South. The Book of Estimates makes no mention of the oft promised decentralisation which is a further blow to the county. I appeal to the Government to withdraw this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question last week about competitiveness as I read about what was expected in the budget. The reply from the Department of Finance was a mess. I asked for the basket of goods used to measure <Col N="1388" /> competitiveness across European countries. It was a lame duck reply which stated that only labour costs were examined in relation to competitiveness. I was told that the budget would answer my question, but it did not.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of getting the people to have confidence in the budget, particularly when there is the prospect of an economic downturn. The Minister's three measures will probably increase wage demands. As was pointed out, the increase in the price of tobacco will even affect old age pensioners. The increase in the price of petrol will add to labour costs as people in industry are mobile. What has the Minister done for competitiveness in this budget? As Deputy Quinn stated, he only reduced employers' PRSI.</P>
      <P>If we look across the whole spectrum of goods, there is no significant recognition of the dilemma facing industry, especially native industry which has been disadvantaged for years. The Minister has nothing to say about native industries except a few abysmal references to capital taxation. When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance did he ever take a basket of goods to compare costs with other countries? How can we compete with our reduced productivity if we do not have petrol or other goods costing less than in competing countries? How can that happen now? Jobs will be lost because the Minister has not faced up to the competitive disadvantage creeping up on us.</P>

        <b>: </b>I support measures to stop people becoming addicted to cigarettes, and from the very first, I called for the banning of cigarette advertising which is now happening. That type of measure should be implemented instead of grabbing tax from people, who should be helped with their addiction, not penalised.</P>
      <P>Environmental reasons are not the genuine ones for increasing the price of petrol or diesel as is shown by the lopsided amounts of money allocated to roads and public transport. If the Government was serious about the environment, it would invest massively in public transport.</P>
      <P>I oppose these resolutions because they continue the drift of the Government's pro big business policies which take from ordinary working people and give to the super wealthy. Under the heading &ldquo;corporation tax,&rdquo; 329 million is handed back while extra taxes are placed on ordinary people. Big businesses will be even more profitable in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This grab is further underlined by figures I received from the Minister in a reply to a parliamentary question which show that the aggregate <Col N="1389" /> amount of money sent abroad by multinational corporations in profit in 1999 and 2000 was £23.3 billion. That amount of money was sent abroad in corporation profits by these companies. They had only paid £3.1 billion in tax. There is adequate funds there to be taken by a small increase even, from these people who can afford it &ndash; these major corporations &ndash; rather than hitting the small people again.</P>

      <P>We are talking about an increase of one third of a euro per gallon in the proposal as it stands at the moment. On top of that there will be a further increase on diesel which will bring it to two thirds of a euro. I ask the Taoiseach if the second increase in diesel has been factored into the consumer price index and what is the availability of this sulphur diesel? The Minister this time last year stated that he would maintain the low rate which he introduced last year on diesel for sulphur-free diesel and not increase the diesel again and so put a further pressure and expense on industry. The payments for corporation tax are being brought forward seven months and this will combine to put huge financial pressure on many small businesses throughout the country. It is a tax on rural Ireland and on the west. The west coast will be forced to haul its manufactured products right across the country to the east coast in order to export them. It is discrimination and no consideration has been given for the second increase which will mean a two thirds of a euro increase on the cost of transport.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes referred earlier to <Col N="1390" /> traffic problems. When he was Minister for Finance there were not too many traffic problems. The only traffic jams in Ireland at that stage were caused by the exodus of people and traffic from the South to the North of Ireland to buy petrol and diesel. The people did all their shopping in the North. That was the time when Deputy Fitzgerald as party leader said there was nothing wrong with the economy of the southern Border counties being devastated. I am glad to note that Fine Gael and Labour appear to have converted to the policy of the best possible excise duty. Thankfully, with Fianna Fáil in Government in the late 1980s, policies were implemented that revived the Border economy and the economy of the southern Border counties.</P>
      <P>The price of oil on the international markets has decreased by about 33% over the past six to eight months, but the reduction in price has not been passed on to the consumer. There is a huge variation in the price of fuel from the south of Ulster to the west of Ireland or to the south of Ireland. I would like to see the introduction of a maximum prices order on fuel costs because the price reduction has not been passed on to the consumer. This is particularly prevalent in the south of Ulster and the north midlands.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolution No. 5: Value-Added Tax.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 5:</P>
      <P>(1) THAT the rate of value-added tax on the supply of certain goods and services at present chargeable at the rate of 20 per cent be increased to 21 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of such goods and services, and that, accordingly, subsection (1) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992)) of section 11 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972), be amended by substituting in paragraph (a) &ldquo;21 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;20 per cent&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 2001 (No. 7 of 2001)).</P>
      <P>(2) THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from 1 March 2002.</P>
      <P>(3) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>An increase from 20% to 21% on the supply of all 20% rated goods and services will come into effect from 1 March 2002. The change in the standard rate will apply to all goods and services which are currently rated at 20% which is the standard rate. This includes items subject to excise, such as petrol and tobacco.</P>
      <P>VAT is remitted by traders to the State on a two-monthly basis: January-February, March-April, and so on. In any one year there are six VAT periods. Obviously, the most suitable date for making the change is at the beginning of a VAT period.</P>
      <P>Because of the changeover to the euro and the difficulties which will result in the January-February period, this increase is not being levelled until 1 March, the beginning of the second two month period. VAT for the last two month period, November-December does not fall to be collected until 2003.</P>
      <P>The increase in the rate will yield 194 million in 2002 and 290 million in a full year. The increase in the standard rate will add approximately 0.4% to the consumer price index. This is being done to raise revenue which the Government needed. It is being done at a time when consumption is strong. Clearly it does not affect exports or inter-business or inter-company trading. It will have a minor effect on the consumer price index in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the resolutions put today this is the most extraordinary one. It shows <Col N="1399" /><Col N="1400" /> how the Government strategy is not well thought out. This increase follows on from a reduction of exactly the same amount last year, 1%. This hot and cold approach to economics is extraordinary. It is bad enough that it is happening but I want to make a few points about it. We have only 30 minutes in which to debate this resolution so I will not use up too much time as other Deputies want to contribute.</P>
      <P>On 1 January we shall have the introduction of the euro and there will be much confusion about it. There are people now who look back on decimalisation and say it was not as inflationary as people think. I am not sure that stands up to examination. Certainly it will undermine effort to control the bumping up prices because of the euro. People will say there is an increase in VAT. The consumer will not know that the increase in VAT does not apply until 1 March. It will encourage people to bump up prices. When VAT takes effect on 1 March, VAT will be put on the bumped up prices. I predict that the increase in inflation will be much higher than that suggested by the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>At a time of unprecedented surpluses, it is extraordinary that the deficits we are heading into and the need to raise taxes had not been prepared for by some contingency operation. I cannot believe this has happened. Anybody who has any prudent business sense would have had a contingency fund, not only for long distance pension commitments but for the time when there might be a downturn in the economy. I hope this is a temporary downturn. In the past, tax incentives were front loaded in terms of corporation tax and lowering the higher rate of tax which was more beneficial to the wealthy. Everybody will have to pay the extra 1% VAT. People will say 1% will not be felt. The 1% will not be felt by businesses because as far as they are concerned there is an input tax and an output tax. One is deducted from the other and the balance is paid to the Revenue so that it does not cost them anything. The consumer, the man and woman in the street will pay this extra 1% VAT. This is not a tax about which business people will be concerned.</P>
      <P>The most extraordinary statement in the Minister's budget speech was that he removed the 1% VAT last year and it was not passed on to the consumer, therefore, he is imposing it again this year. Given that prices were not reduced last year because of the removal of the 1% VAT, he is now imposing another 1%. Instead of going back to the 20% VAT rate perhaps we are talking about a 22% plus VAT rate. This is extraordinary logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not call it logic. That is going a bit far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister for Finance said today. Inevitably there will be price increases due to the introduction of the euro, no matter what the Minister claims. Last year he was unable to protect the consumer when he removed the 1% VAT as it was not passed on to the con<Col N="1401" /> sumer. The same will happen with the euro. As sure as night follows day, many business people, in the confusion of the conversion rate to the euro, will charge extra to the consumer. The effect of that and the 1% on top of the prices which were not reduced last year, will be that the meagre increases in social welfare and the meagre tax benefits for the less well off will leave them only marginally better off. It is an extraordinary piece of political and economic inconsistency. The Tánaiste said the increase in the standard rate would add approximately 0.4% to the consumer price index. I would be surprised if that was the outturn and if, together with what happens with the euro, this does not add 1% to the inflation rate. The inflation rate has been 4% since Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance and it has been higher than the EU average for much of the past few years. It is only in recent years that the rate has been lower. We are heading to a position where we will be at the top the inflation league in the European Union. In time this will lead to increased pay demands because people will not be able to measure the true effect of the euro. They will see the VAT increases being passed on, will begin to look at the economy anew and realise they are into a new era where pay increases will be chasing tax increases and we will return to that whole cycle. Between two budgets, it is extraordinary that in one year 1% VAT was removed while it was added on in the following year.</P>
      <P>Price increases on cider and tobacco have been announced this evening. I presume the VAT increases will be imposed on the cider and tobacco price increases in March. Given that the full extent of the increase has not been made clear many do not know the full extent of the bad news. The Minister for Finance said the reduction in VAT was not passed on, therefore he simply put it back on again on top of the prices that were not reduced. Where was the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs? The Tánaiste is the Cabinet Minister with overall responsibility for consumer affairs. She has an active Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs who carries out the function on a delegated basis. If it was not passed on why did not the Minister of State and all the machinery of the State go after those who did not pass it on? Why was it not passed on to those on small incomes, those living alone on £101 per week who did not qualify for a medical card, some of whom cannot afford to go out or to light a fire at home. That is the reality of life for some people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many Members have to go to the State agencies, which are supposed to have discretion when it comes to issuing medical cards, after those agencies have gone through the investigative process and turned their backs on these people? Members often have to approach the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on their behalf to bail them out. That is the reality of life for many people. Why did the Minister and the Minister of State not go after those who did not remove the <Col N="1402" /> VAT last year? It is not good enough to say that when legislation and Resolutions of this kind reducing the VAT rate was not passed on that it has to be imposed again. Everybody will pay twice but the poor will pay disproportionately. For those on a low income this is a considerable strain. On all the proposals before the House, we can all make a case, as I have heard a Deputy do for the cider industry in his constituency as it involves employment. We heard a case made about other matters. A case could have been made that tobacco revenue should not only be increased, but that it should be ring fenced and spent on health and medical cards. However, I cannot see a case for decreasing the VAT rate by 1% VAT in one year while the following year the same Minister increases it by 1%. It indicates the Government does not have a consistent view of where this country is going in terms of the needs of the economy. We will oppose this proposal vigorously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anything the Minister has done betrays more the &ldquo;make it up as you go&rdquo; shape of this budget. How he could possibly reduce the standard rate of VAT from 21% to 20% last year, and reverse engines this year seems impossible to understand. It does not communicate any strategy on his part. He resolved that he was would not have a borrowing requirement. He called in his officials and said:</P>
      <P>Look lads, you know my form. Whatever we do, we can't have a borrowing requirement. I want to go out on a high. I didn't anticipate the shambles in which I find myself. Whatever you do, put together figures for me where there is no borrowing requirement.</P>
      <P>He has to raid one fund, confiscate another and do this and that to try to balance the books. The Minister for Foreign Affairs may well chuckle.</P>

      <P>That is what has happened. The Minister watched an unprecedented surplus disappear like snow off a ditch. He gave no explanation as to how it happened. Employment has held up quite well. The Tánaiste will tell us that by and large workers who lost their jobs in many locations in the past year were re-employed. Therefore, why are the receipts down so dramatically?</P>
      <P>I understand many won money today on the matter of the duration of the Minister's speech. He made no effort to address the issue of how we have come from where we were a year ago to where we are now. He cannot blame the events of 11 September and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The household survey figures issued last week show the employment figures. This is extremely difficult to understand. The Minister has to produce some plus above the bottom line and he contrived to do so by a number of raids, confiscating part of the reserves of the Central Bank and illegally raiding the social insurance fund. I understand the Taoiseach on television saying it is not illegal, but I believe it is. It is certainly illegal until amending legislation is brought forward and even then there is a question to be raised about the propriety of what is being done. The Tánaiste told us that this measure will bring in £194 million this year and £290 million next year. Compare that to the give-away to employers in respect of PRSI which is in order of £349 million in terms of the reduction from 12% to 10.75%.</P>
      <P>The Minister goes around picking targets. There is no rhythm, reason or consistency to it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is offering and I will give him some of my time as I always enjoy listening to him. Can he, as a former Minister for Health and Children, tell us what is the sense of putting an extra 10p on the price of a packet of cigarettes? Where is the consistency in that? What is the point? If the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, means what he says, then the 10p increase makes no sense. As Deputy Mitchell said, it would make some sense to impose a proper figure, ringfence it and somehow underpin the health strategy. There is nothing in this on the capital side to underpin the health strategy. It does not make any sense. It does not make any sense to select Deputy Healy's constituency, an indigenous industry in the cider area. Why cider? Why did the Minister for Finance not look to his friends, the publicans, and take a percentage off them? That has not happened since 1994. That is because he is afraid of inflation. That is only reason.</P>
      <P>This is all about getting past the next few months. Consider the horrific projections for 2003 and 2004. That betrays the situation. This is a cosmetic manipulation of the figures to get past this budget and get us as far as the next general election. I do not believe that will happen because this does not make any sense.</P>
      <P>It is only three years since the same Minister talked to us about the possibility of joining the two VAT rates. Figures of 16% and 17% were idly trotted out and the idea was that the rate would fall to a single figure. He took a percentage point off the rate and brought it down to 20%. The implication was that if rate was going anywhere, it was going down, but now he has decided to put it back up. That does not make any sense except, as the Tánaiste frankly admitted, to get some revenue. That is to get us past this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who will feel the pinch most are those on low incomes. They will be disproportionately hit by this measure because more of their disposal income in terms of the total household will be affected by it. The Tánaiste said that it will result in an increase in inflation of 0.4% in <Col N="1404" /> the CPI. That does not make any sense. It would have been far more honest if the Minister had told us how the unbelievable riches were frittered away. It looked embarrassing, in terms of the ICC, the TSB and so on, as to what we were going to do with the money.</P>

      <P>It has gone. There were unimaginable riches. The Minister had to make the announcement in relation to the ACC this morning to try to plug another hole. He cannot go on finding emergency sales in order to bail him out of what is especially bad management, if one considers this from the point of view of what the Minister does.</P>
      <P>Having boasted and lectured about spending &ndash; I agree with much of the spending in which he has engaged &ndash; from his point of view, he is the great disciple of Milton Friedman and opposed to all spending where it can be avoided. He has done the exact opposite. He has blown the extraordinary riches we had. What is this chopping and changing going to do in terms of an economic strategy or even a fiscal strategy? It is chopping and changing just like he has been chopping and changing in the housing market and look at what he has done to that. Now he thinks he can reverse engines again and try to encourage investors back into the market. Having moved in one direction, he is going 180 degrees in the other direction. This does not make any sense. On something as significant in the cocktail of taxes as VAT, I cannot understand how he can say that in one year he is going in the direction of reducing the rate from 21% to 20% and the next year say he is going in the opposite direction and putting the rate back up.</P>
      <P>I ask the Tánaiste what is the answer to the point made by the Minister that he is doing this because the reduction was not being passed on. That is the first I heard about this. There have been many opportunities at Question Time for the Minister to tell the House about it. What are his officials saying? What is the answer? If it was not being passed on, why was something not being done about it? Are any other reductions in taxes not being passed on? This is a new dimension and a very unusual explanation for what he is doing.</P>
      <P>This is inconsistent. It is chopping and changing. It will disproportionately affect those on low incomes and bring in less revenue than that which will be given back to IBEC employers in terms of the reduction in employers' PRSI.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the debate this evening on a number of matters. I heard Deputy Quinn talk about the philosophical underpinning of the budget and that it was important to get that right. I listened to two variations of his own philosophical underpinning from his Finance spokesman, Deputy McDowell, who gave a critique of his analysis of social market economics, and I am delighted that, in recent years, Deputy Rabbitte has converted from Marxist economics to social market economics as well. These are all improvements in our political debate, but we have been asked about the purpose of bringing forward this budget. The purpose is simple &ndash; to continue with the social inclusion measures which far outstrip those of any previous Government. They are unprecedented in the history of the State, and we have maintained them today.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy McDowell, who spoke about the need for more spending and more taxes, but we did not hear specifically how the Labour Party intends to balance that act. He said we have taken too much off on direct taxation. How many of the 380,000 workers who have been taken out of the tax net by the Minister's budget does the Labour Party wish to return to the tax net, and at what rate? We would like to hear that when its members talk about the philosophical underpinning of the budget. Is Deputy Rabbitte suggesting, on the <Col N="1406" /> basis of what he expected to be an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £1.5 billion, that it would be prudent for a Minister for Finance to go on the international markets and borrow that £1.5 billion if it is legitimately available in the system?</P>

He cannot come in here and say, as Deputy McDowell, the official Labour Party Finance spokesman suggested, that we need to put more into capital infrastructure, that we need more direct taxation because we have taken too much off the rates and that we need more social inclusion without telling us how to balance that situation. That is what we have heard from the Labour Party this evening.</P>

In fairness to Deputy McDowell, he made clear his philosophical underpinning of the budget, in a way Deputy Rabbitte did not, by saying that the Labour Party intends to increase the tax take from workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that the reduction in rates of capital taxation is a once-off plus to the Exchequer. As Deputy Quinn knows, there has been a greater take on capital taxes under this Administration than during the Administration in which he served as Minister for Finance. As Deputy McDowell said openly, and I give him credit for his clarity, he wishes to increase the rate of capital taxation in this economy because, in his opinion, it is too low. I want to know, as a result of the reduced take from that, where we will get the money. That is the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte spanned the whole spectrum in relation to the underpinning of the budget, and I am entitled to respond in the same fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall the last budget introduced by Deputy Quinn. He talked about philosophical underpinning and spoke with some sense of purpose about the fact that he was increasing child benefit by £1 for the first and second child and by £5 for the third and subsequent children, yet he questioned the sense of social justice of a Minister for Finance who has increased, for the second year in a row, child benefit by £25 for the first and second child and £30 for the third child and subsequent children. When the Labour Party came to power in the rainbow Administration, it put forward child benefit as the most effective means of transferring money to lower income families. I am always amused to hear the Labour Party say it did not have the money to do that when it was in Government. The total spend in its three budgets was £40 billion, but as a result of Deputy Quinn's last budget, a family with four children ended up with child benefit of £138 per month. This so-called Milton Friedman has brought forward five budgets as a result of which £418 per <Col N="1408" /> month is being paid to that same low income family with four children, using the precise mechanism in which the Labour Party claimed to major during its three budgets.</P>
    <P>Some argument was made about chopping and changing, but this Minister has brought about a greater streamlining of the taxation system than any of his predecessors and he has continued with the idea that over the next five years corporate taxation, on the basis of 20% per annum, will begin to pay in the current year the same amount as PAYE workers and the self-employed. Far from the rhetoric we have heard about social justice, that is an indication of pragmatic politics in action which is bringing about the reality that there are 380,000 workers, not unemployed people&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his third budget the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, spoke about getting 35,000 extra workers out of the tax net and the socialists and the former Workers' Party members were delighted. What a social justice engineer, but the Minister for Finance has delivered in a way that makes the achievements of the Deputies opposite fairly minimal. Ordinary workers recognise the massive social welfare budget of £850 million and a further tax budget of £500 million have brought about the sort of progress they expect in these times.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;No Fault&rdquo; Advisory Group has met on four occasions in 2001 and is in the process of finalising its work programme for 2002. In the first phase of its work the group agreed its terms of reference and a broad outline of its work programme. It has recently had a presentation by two of its specialist medical members on the causes of cerebral palsy. At its first meeting in 2002 it will have a presentation by two of the representatives of the legal professions on the present legal framework for handling compensation claims on behalf of brain damaged babies. In February it is hoped to arrange to have a presentation on existing services for children and adults with physical and intellectual disabilities.</P>
      <P>The group has made a good start on looking at what is a complex and difficult problem. The chairman of the group, Dr. Peter McKenna, Master of the Rotunda Hospital, hopes to produce at least an interim report by the summer of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>The new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: a Health System for You, sets out a framework for growth and development, modernisation and reform for the health system over the next seven to ten years. Successful completion of the 121 actions outlined in the strategy will require a very significant change management programme, the first element of which involves clear communication to all stakeholders of the vision, underlying principles, goals, objectives and the actions required to yield a successful outcome.</P>
      <P>The first stage of this process involved the launch of the strategy on 26 November, before an audience which quite deliberately included representatives of the many stakeholders involved. The follow through to the launch on 26 November has involved wide dissemination of the strategy document and supporting documents, as well as a programme of formal presentations on the content of the strategy throughout the health system. These presentations are supported by a range of centrally prepared audio-visual materials to ensure uniformity in the approach taken in different settings.</P>
      <P>Given the scale of the programme involved and the key importance of effectively communicating the main messages to all stakeholders, my Department, following a tendering process, engaged Carr Communications to advise on and provide all necessary support for the communications programme around the strategy.</P>
      <P>Specifically the tender related to the following activities: to provide advice and support on and to organise pre-launch publicity for the new health strategy; to organise the launch of the new health strategy; to prepare, support and implement a communications plan to promote the main messages of the new health strategy; to provide on-going support for the post launch phase of the new health strategy; and to provide general communications support on related issues across the Department's brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated cost of the consultancy assign<Col N="1415" /> ment for the communications programme and for the launch itself &ndash; seating, technical support, refreshments etc. &ndash; totals some £103,000 or 130,783.</P>
    <P>This investment needs to be viewed in the context of the vital importance of effective communication to in the region of 90,000 staff now working in the health system as well as the very many people otherwise involved with the health services in a whole variety of roles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in County Cork is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board, SHB, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced to the orthodontic service. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training in October last for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million or 1.269 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. My Department would welcome proposals for a specialist training programme from this uni<Col N="1416" /> versity and the consultant orthodontists of the Southern Health Board and neighbouring boards.</P>
    <P>Cognisant that it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. The Southern Health Board has been allocated an additional £0.938 million or 1.191 million this year for orthodontic services of which £0.813 million or 1.032 million was for an orthodontic initiative in the board's area. Under the initiative, the board propose to, amongst other things, recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, develop new orthodontic units in Tralee and the northside of Cork city and commission four additional orthodontic chairs at the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that the Local Appointments Commission has recommended a candidate for one of the consultant orthodontist posts, to be based in the north of Cork city. The board is arranging with the Local Appointments Commission to re-advertise the other consultant post to expedite an early appointment.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of the initiative, my Department is also exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the board has also informed me that there are approximately 3,497 children in County Cork awaiting orthodontic treatment and at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were approximately 2,300 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board's area.</P>
    <P>I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment in the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>The hospital in-patient waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists as at the 30 June 2001, in the format collected by my Department, are being communicated separately to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people on public hospital waiting lists in June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was 26,659. This figure represents a decrease of 5,192 or 16% on the comparable figure for June 2000. During this period <Col N="1417" /> there have been significant reductions in the waiting lists for target specialties with the number waiting for cardiac surgery down by 52%, the number waiting for gynaecology procedures down by 35% and the number waiting for ENT procedures down by 30%.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has also been made in reducing waiting times. During the period June 2000 to June 2001 the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 68%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 38% and the number waiting for orthopaedic services for more than 12 months decreased by 16%. During the same period the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months deceased by 85%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 31% and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 25%.</P>
    <P>The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times.</P>
    <P>The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients either in the private sector or, if necessary, abroad.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. The overall target of the new strategy is that an additional 650 beds will be in place by the end of 2002 with an extra 3,000 beds provided over the period to 2011.</P>
    <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospital agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>It is the intention to convene a further meeting of the working group on carers needs assessment, in the month of January next, with a view to reaching a conclusion on the contents of recommendations to the relevant Ministers outlining improved measures in the provision of assistance to informal carers. Since the working group first met in 1999, my Department has continued to provide funding to the health boards to grant specific assistance to carers, and the total funding, taking next year's Estimates into account, now stands at around £4.8 million or 6.095 million. In addition, conditions for receipt of the carer's allowance have been eased by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The new health strategy, which was launched last week, accepts that a large number of older people would like the option of receiving care in their home rather than in a nursing home and it, accordingly, recommends a number of key actions that will assist care-givers to enable this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It points to the fact that the recent expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has shown that current funding arrangements do <Col N="1420" /> not effectively support home care, and gives a commitment to reform existing schemes by introducing an integrated care subvention scheme which will maximise support for home care.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the working group's report and to seeing how we can move forward with implementing its recommendations in a manner consistent with the principles outlined in the health strategy.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy. This study was undertaken by the public health departments of the health boards in response to the growing concerns about the rising trends in suicide. The report confirms many of the findings of the National Task Force on Suicide which published its report in 1998.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of this new report is that the recommendations of the report of the national task force be fully implemented. Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations and this is reflected in the reduction in the number of recorded suicides for the past two years. Many of the recommendations of the task force, however, require continuous development particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention. I am fully committed to supporting suicide prevention programmes and the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, published last week, includes a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes over the coming years.</P>
      <P>In order to further reduce the number of suicides it is essential that people undergoing life crises should get appropriate support. In this regard over £3 million or 3.8 million has been provided since the publication of the report of the task force on suicide towards suicide prevention and towards research aimed at improving understanding of this issue. Additional funding has also been made available to further develop child and adolescent psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report referred to by the Deputy confirms the high rate of suicide among men and, in particular, young men. The recently published health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, acknowledges the importance of <Col N="1421" /> men's health and confirms that a policy for men's health and health promotion will be developed by my Department.</P>
    <P>This new report also recommends that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public through the development of improved community based mental health services. The level of funding which has been made available for the development of community based mental health facilities has increased significantly in recent years and community services such as home nursing, day centres, family support, hostels and day hospitals will continue to be developed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was launched in October 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. The programme offers free breast screening to women living in the phase one areas aged between 50 and 64 years. To date over 50,000 women have been called for screening, and over 34,000 women have been screened. Counties Longford, Westmeath, Meath and areas of Dublin have been screened and BreastCheck is currently screening more areas in Dublin and counties Louth and Kildare. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. BreastCheck is currently in consultation with health boards concerning the roll-out of the programme nationwide. Under the national health strategy, commitment has been given to the full extension of the breast screening programme. In this context, I will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to national coverage as soon as is practically possible, having regard, in particular to the experience gained in putting phase one of the programme in place.</P>

      <P>I established the Forum on Fluoridation in May 2000. The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum held its first meeting in September 2000.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are as follows: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area; and to report to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The forum invited the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined individually.</P>
      <P>The forum's web site &ndash; http://www.fluoridationforum.ie &ndash; gives details of the forum's progress. The chairman of the forum has informed me that he expects to present the forum's report to me in the near future.</P>

      <P>The placement of children and teenagers in adult psychiatric facilities is increasingly seen as inappropriate. The recently published health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, includes a commitment to the development and expansion of appropriate mental health services for this group.</P>
      <P>The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services, published in March 2001, recommends that a total of seven child and adolescent inpatient units for children aged from six-16 should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have already been established in respect of four of these units, to be based in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick, and design briefs are being prepared. The report also recommended a significant enhancement and expansion of child psychiatric services throughout the country. The implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report is now a priority and is included among the measures proposed in the health strategy to improve health services for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> A sub-group of the working group is currently examining the provision of psychiatric services for persons between 16 and 18 years. As services for this client group are currently provided within the adult mental health services, the sub-group consists of experts from both fields, i.e. adult mental health services and child mental health services. The sub-group is considering how the needs of 16-18 year olds should be addressed in the context of future service developments and will make recommendations accordingly. I expect this group to complete its work within the next few months.</P>

      <P>In mid-October the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, wrote to my Department in relation to payments for public health doctors who may have to be called on out-of-hours in response to alerts relating to biological threats. My Department replied to the IMO advising them that the appropriate statutory body for dealing with such claims is the Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA. Subsequently, it was brought to my Department's attention that the IMO had advised public health doctors not to agree to participate in out-of-hours on-call rosters in the event of a biological incident. My Department again wrote <Col N="1424" /> to the IMO requesting it to withdraw with immediate effect their advice to public health doctors and to pursue their claim through normal industrial relations channels.

      <P>Healthcare risk waste which is about 20% of all health waste, is disposed of through specialist waste contractors. All healthcare risk waste from publicly funded hospitals is disposed of in this way. These specialist contractors operate to very high standards which are set out in a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA and they are closely monitored regarding these standards by the EPA. They have a very good record of compliance with their licence conditions. The non-risk waste is disposed of through the municipal or commercial waste disposal route.</P>
      <P>Detailed guidance on segregation and packaging of healthcare risk waste has been in circulation to all appropriate public hospitals for some time. Immediately following recent media reports concerning illegal dump sites in Wicklow, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, reminded all public hospitals in its area of the continued necessity to comply with these guidelines. The issue of waste management in public hospital is a matter which is taken extremely seriously by hospital authorities and my Department and the ERHA are keeping this matter under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and the improved <Col N="1425" /> access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times.</P>
      <P>The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients either in the private sector or, if necessary, abroad.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has already been made in reducing waiting times. During the period June 2000 to June 2001 the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 68%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 38% and the number waiting for orthopaedic services for more than 12 months decreased by 16%. During the same period the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months deceased by 85%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 31% and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 25%.</P>
      <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. The overall target of the new strategy is that an additional 650 beds will be in place by the end of 2002 with an extra 3,000 beds provided over the period to 2011.</P>
      <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospital agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable hospital system for public patients.</P>
      <P>With regard to orthodontic services, I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment. Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training in October last for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million or 1.269 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. My Department would welcome proposals for a specialist training programme from this university and the consultant orthodontists of the Southern Health Board and neighbouring boards.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million or 6.729 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million or 4.698 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>The orthodontic initiative is beginning to impact on the public orthodontic service. At the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 16,107 patients in orthodontic treatment, an increase of over 580 patients in treatment when compared with the previous quarter. I am confident that the capacity of the public orthodontic service, in terms of the numbers in orthodontic treatment, will increase further as health boards continue to make progress with implementing their proposals under the initiative.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to report that phase one of the national cervical screening programme was launched in Limerick on 16 October 2000. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered to approximately 67,000 women, free of charge, at five yearly intervals in the MidWestern Health Board area. An expert advisory group on cervical screening is currently overseeing the implementation of phase one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the extension of the programme to the rest of the country is currently under consideration. This will be a major undertaking with logistical and significant resource implications, which requires careful planning and organisation. The importance of achieving a national cervical screening programme, which is <Col N="1428" /> underpinned by quality assurance and best practice, is a key objective. The experience gained from phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll out of this programme. Currently, the chief executive officers of the health boards are involved in an examination of the feasibility and implications of extending the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Under the national health strategy commitment has been given to the full extension of the cervical screening programme. In this context I will continue to support the cervical screening programme in moving to national coverage as soon as is practically possible, having regard, in particular to the experience gained in putting phase 1 of the programme in place.</P>

The children in respect of whom these allowances are paid must be in the care of the health board, under the Child Care Act, 1991, either on a voluntary basis or by court order. Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children. The most recent figures available, from the child care interim minimum dataset 2000, indicate that there are 790 children in respect of whom foster care allowance is being paid to family members.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of relative care, where appropriate, rests with the health board, who must regard the welfare of the child, and his or her adequate care and protection as the first and paramount consideration.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last four years there has been substantial investment in and development of health services in Ireland. The aim of the strategy document is to move away from short-term approaches to planning and to provide a blueprint for the whole health system to realise ambitious and wide-ranging change over the next seven to ten years.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to health as a key priority area is underlined by the comprehensive targets set in the strategy. It is a long-term programme but it sets out a very clear plan and a very clear vision for the future. In setting out such a comprehensive and large-scale plan, it is inevitable that prioritising of actions must take place. This is, after all, a seven to ten year programme. The strategy represents a clear plan for moving forward which is based on a step by step approach to reducing inequalities in the system and building the necessary capacity to meet the growing needs of the population.</P>
      <P>Our first priorities are the reduction of waiting lists, strengthening primary care, improvements in services for people with disabilities and for older people and also to ensure that those who have eligibility, can actually gain access to the services they are entitled to. This means building up capacity in core services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> This is why the Government has prioritised the creation of 3,000 extra hospital beds, all of which will be designated for public patients. Some 650 of these will be in place by the end of 2002. The putting in place of the treatment purchase fund is another element in this strategy to protect equity for public patients. A treatment purchase team will be appointed very quickly. This team will arrange for the purchase of treatments for public patients who have waited for more than three months from their out-patient appointment. The team will set targets and monitor progress over the next three years. In the first instance, the focus will be on patients who have waited longest, consistent with clinical need.</P>
    <P>This initiative represents a concentrated, focused drive to reduce waiting times for public patients, so that we ensure no patient has to await treatment for unacceptably long periods of time. The target is to have reduced waiting times by the end of 2002 to 12 months for adults and six months for children; by the end of 2003 to six months and three months respectively and by 2004 to have reduced waiting times to three months for all public patients.</P>
    <P>Beginning the work on the vision of primary care for the future is also vitally important. This is a radical long-term programme which needs to build up momentum as quickly as possible in order to achieve the targets we have set ourselves by the end of 2011. This model seeks to address this problem putting in place co-ordinated integrated one stop shops for service that will be of particular benefit to older people and medical card holders. The first step will be the expansion of 24-hour, seven-day GP co-operatives beginning straight away. This will be supported by the immediate establishment of a primary care task force to help drive the roll-out of a new model. The emphasis will be on putting together primary care teams which can meet the needs of patients and clients effectively. Patients will have the option of enrolling with these teams, and with an individual general practitioner. If they so wish, they will be able to self-refer to any member of the team. The plan is to have an out-of-hours service and GP co-operative arrangements extended nationally by the end of 2003, with the first 20 to 30 primary care implementation teams in place by the same date.</P>
    <P>Continuing care services for people with disabilities and older people are also being prioritised. People with disabilities will gain from the addition of a significant number of extra day places, respite care places and residential capacity being put in place from the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>Older people will also benefit substantially. Our commitment here is for a total of 1,370 extra assessment and rehabilitation places, 600 extra day places and for 800 extra residential or community nursing places per annum each year over the next seven years. The first of these additional places will be put in place next year. These <Col N="1431" /> improvements will bring real, tangible benefits for older people.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that health services are only one factor in determining the health of a nation. The Government's focus has been to look beyond health services to tackle health status by strengthening inter-sectoral responses to health needs and by placing health at the centre of public policy both inside and outside of the health system. A number of actions related to the issue of population health status will also be completed next year. These include actions which are aimed at improving people's living and working environments, reducing the incidence of smoking, programmes focused on children's early health and social development, as well as a range of provisions to plan for and promote better health status and quality of life for the most vulnerable groups in our society.</P>
    <P>A number of actions will also make services more accessible through: clearer rules regarding eligibility; designation of new beds for public patients only; improvements in way accident and emergency and out-patient departments are organised; and much improved communication especially for hard to reach groups.</P>
    <P>These actions are also front-loaded for next year. Other basic provisions such as specific appointment times and improvements in opening times can also commence quickly.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of improving services will be listening to what people tell us about services they use. An agreed system of patient feedback will be published and implemented by the end of 2002. In addition, during 2002, a range of community level structures to give communities a voice in the planning of services will be established.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined to you here are some of the key elements of a strategy which is concerned with getting at the root of problems in the health system. This is not a plan for &ldquo;quick wins&rdquo; but a strategy which, if properly implemented on an incremental basis, has real potential to achieve our vision for the future. It has short, medium and long-term goals. Of the short-term priorities, I anticipate tangible improvements next year in the provision of acute hospital services in particular.</P>
    <P>This strategy is unique in that it sets out a detailed plan with deliverables and target dates for implementation of the 121 actions listed. In addition, there are clear structures for overseeing the implementation process. I will be establishing a national steering group with external expertise in change management to guide implementation before Christmas. Arrangements are also under way to set up a dedicated national implementation team in my Department and I will be meeting the health board chief executive officers later this month to discuss implementation at regional and local level. I am confident that we can make progress quickly on many aspects of the strategy. In addition, we need to begin planning for the <Col N="1432" /> longer term objectives so that the essential groundwork to achieve change can be advanced.</P>

      <P>The Government, in April this year, approved the establishment of a National Task Force on Medical Manpower to, <i>inter alia</i>, prepare and oversee the execution of a detailed implementation programme based on the recommendations in the report of the Medical Manpower Forum and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; the Hanly Report. The Government also decided that it would consider the proposed development of a consultant-delivered public hospital service following quantification of the resource and cost implications involved.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department, in consultation with Mr. David Hanly, independent chairperson of the national task force on medical manpower, are currently working on the draft terms of reference and working structures of the task force and I intend to proceed with the establishment of the task force and the holding of its inaugural meeting shortly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the forum report sets out proposals for the structuring of consultant posts both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service. Following the establishment of the task force, a detailed quantification of the resource implications will be undertaken. It is very important that this study produces detailed and accurate data on the number of staff and the costs involved.</P>
      <P>The task force will also address the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU Directive on Working Time and the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce.</P>

Its purpose is to test for the presence of four metabolic conditions and one endocrine condition in children.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The subjects of cloning and research on embryos are ones which raise a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. While there is no legislation regulating this area, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the medical council. These provide that the creation of embryos for experimental purposes would be professional misconduct. I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate cloning and a range of other issues associated with the area of assisted human reproduction, including research on embryos. I am aware that this concern may have been heightened particularly in light of the reports from the United States that a human embryo has been cloned.</P>
      <P>With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, a Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The commission has met on eight occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent on 22 November 2001. I understand that the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work. Initially, each discipline &ndash; medical, legal scientific and social, prepared a report outlining the current position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues that needed to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. In order to inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission recently placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wished to do so to make written submissions before Wednesday, 31 October 2001. Over 1,600 <Col N="1436" /> submissions have been received by the commissions and are currently being examined.</P>
    <P>Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work, but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue to work as expeditiously as is feasible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

      <P>The basic structures to deal with biological attack are already in place at both regional and national level. These structures include the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Virus Reference Laboratory at national level and the departments of public health at regional level.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the events of 11 September, I established a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, director of the Virus Reference Laboratory, to prepare an operational plan which would be implemented in the event of a biological attack on this country. The committee agreed that in preparing a plan it will be necessary to identify the level of risk of such an attack and that the plan should reflect the risk identified. The committee considered that although the risk of a primary attack in this country was low, the secondary consequences of an attack in another country was the more likely threat</P>
      <P>On 17 October I launched a protocol for dealing with a suspected anthrax attack in Ireland. The protocol was prepared by the expert committee and deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax attack including patient treatment and management, post exposure guidelines, etc. Included with the protocol are guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax. The protocol is revised on an ongoing basis as a result of feedback to the committee. The protocol and guidelines are available on the Department's web site &ndash; www.doh.ie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert committee has prepared a more detailed protocol which deals with the other category A agents including smallpox, botulism, plague and tularaemia. Similar to anthrax, the key issues are preparedness and prevention, based on early detection and surveillance, and the provision of prompt public health responses. The protocol is currently in draft form however a working document will issue shortly to appropri<Col N="1437" /> ate medical and emergency personnel. Based on the recommendations of the committee I have approved of the purchase of specific antibiotics and vaccine which would be required in the event of a biological attack with specific Class A agents.</P>
    <P>This issue was discussed at a health council meeting held in Brussels on 15 November, which was attended by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Moffatt.</P>

      <P>The national nuclear emergency plan is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise. Stocks of iodine tablets were distributed to and held by all regional health boards since 1991 as part of the plan. It has emerged that some health boards have disposed of these stocks as they were past their best before date and these boards believed that they were ineffective. I am advised that current stocks held by boards are as follows: Eastern Regional Health Authority: 720,000, tested 12 months ago and useable at that time; South-Eastern Health Board: 360,000, tested recently and useable; North-Eastern Health Board: 180,000, tested in 1999 and useable at that time; North-Western Health Board: 30,000 untested tablets; Mid-Western Health Board: 300,000 untested tablets; Midland Health Board: nil; Western Health Board: nil; and Southern Health Board: nil.</P>
      <P>Only the most severe nuclear accidents will require the use of iodine tablets. Ingestion of iodine tablets may be effective in preventing thyroid cancer in certain populations, especially children exposed to radioactive fallout. The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the national nuclear emergency plan was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I accepted this recommendation and my Department, through the Eastern Regional Health Authority, has carried out the appropriate tendering process for the purchase of new stocks. Methods of pre-distribution are under consideration and I will announce further details after consultation with the Government task force on emergency planning.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>Persons with any of the above illnesses may apply to their local health board for admission to the long-term illness scheme. If eligible they are issued with a long-term illness book. This lists the drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition that will be provided to them free of charge through their community pharmacist.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. Where a person's income exceeds the guidelines a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme no individual or family unit pays more than £42 or 53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>The recent OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland was critical of certain restrictions in Irish professions, including the retail pharmaceutical sector. A high level group has been established to examine the recommendations made in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area addressed by the report was the statutory system for granting community pharmacy contracts. In order to assess and respond to <Col N="1440" /> the issues raised by the OECD I have set up the pharmacy review group which will report to the high level group. The group has begun its work under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael Mortell, former President of University College Cork, and it is expected that it will make recommendations to the high level group within six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>Last week the Consumers' Association of Ireland made representations to be included on the review group. There are a large number of consumer groups with an interest in the review. It would be difficult to include the consumers' association in the group and not include those groups which specifically represent pharmacy users such as the elderly, asthmatics and diabetics. Inclusion of so many groups would make the review unwieldy and greatly reduce its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference take account of consumer concerns by requiring the group to consult widely with consumer interests. As well as a general invitation for public submissions, a wide range of consumer organisations, including the consumers' association and groups representing pharmacy users, have been specifically invited to make submissions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have been engaged in the review of the entire registration system. The review examined the structure of registration on a national basis in order to identify the changes needed to capitalise on the use of modern computer technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration. The objective is to implement a modern efficient effective and customer focused service geared to the needs of the 21st century. The modernisation of the registration service will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes. The matter raised by the Deputy had been noted by the project team. The modernisation project has received submissions from a number of parties, including coroners, following the launch of its consultation document last May. This consultation process is continuing.</P>

      <P>The health strategy is a blueprint to guide policy makers and service providers in achieving the vision of a future health system. Two key strands are addressed in the framework for human resources: ensuring a qualified, competent workforce to meet the changing demands of the people; and becoming an employer of choice.</P>
      <P>In the first strand integrated workforce planning will be introduced on a national basis and the required number of extra health staff will be recruited. In order to achieve the additional numbers required, a number of initiatives are or will be undertaken. In the nursing area these include the following: 10,000 nurses will be trained over the lifetime of the strategy; the implementation of the final report on the study of the nursing and midwifery resource; the introduction of degree level education for nursing in 2002; it is also proposed to build on existing steps including the recent introduction of flexible working arrangements; payment of fees to registered nurses and midwives undertaking part-time post-registration degrees and courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; the provision of flexible return to nursing and midwifery courses for nurses wishing to rejoin the workforce and continuation of the drive to recruit from overseas; some 2,000 work authorisations/visas have been issued to nurses and midwives from abroad in the year up to June; and the development of further clinical specialist and advanced practitioner posts in nursing and midwifery within the framework of the new National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.</P>
      <P>The strategy is also committed to the promotion of best practice in recruitment and retention. In line with this policy the Office for Health Management will prepare guidelines on best practice in advertising policies and recruitment for staff of the health system. These will be circulated to all health employers. The guidelines will include guidance on induction arrangements for all staff. The Health Service Employers Agency will work with the Office for Health Management to advise employers on implementation of the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retention rates for the system and individual <Col N="1443" /> employers will be measured in order to benchmark minimum standards and set targets for reducing turnover rates. Health service employers will be encouraged to adopt innovative approaches to job design. Initiatives such as flexible working and training, arrangements for atypical working hours and specific family-friendly approaches will be aimed at meeting the needs of health service workers and their families as well as the efficiency of the service. The chief nursing officer has convened a group to prepare guidance for best practice on recruitment of overseas nurses and midwives. This document will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In the second strand, the strategy includes a commitment to develop the human resource function in the health system by December 2002. A detailed action plan for people management will also be developed by October 2002 which will provide a clear roadmap for action over the next five to seven years. This plan will seek to ensure that the health service has the right people with the right competencies in the right numbers, organised and managed in the right way, to deliver the goals and objectives of the health strategy.</P>

      <P>Framing the Future, the recently published report of the National Women's Council of Ireland and to which the Deputy refers, notes that the women's community and voluntary sector accounts for 2,631 groups and organisations and caters for about 75,000 women annually. These groups range from small locally based women's groups to larger service providing organisations, for example refuges and rape crisis centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the particular health needs of women and a plan for women's health was approved by Government in 1997 in response to <Col N="1444" /> concerns that women's health needs were not always being met by the Irish health services in the past. This plan is the blueprint for improving and developing the health care services required by women. Some of its objectives are: to maximise the health and social gain of Irish women; to create a woman-friendly health service; and to increase consultation with and representation of women in health services.</P>
    <P>The plan focuses on 12 key issues relevant to women's health and provides a commitment to action in relation to each of these areas. The actions proposed are consistent with and integrated into other policy initiatives in the health services such as the national cancer strategy, the health promotion strategy, the national alcohol policy, the management development strategy for the health and personal social services and the cardiovascular strategy.</P>
    <P>Following the launch of the plan, the women's health council was established in 1997 to develop a centre of expertise on women's health, to foster research into women's health, to evaluate the success of the plan for women's health in meeting it objectives and to advise the Minister on women's health issues generally.</P>
    <P>Each of the health boards have appointed co-ordinators of women's health. The health boards may also fund women's organisations for health related projects.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the Government set up a task force on violence against women and its report was published in 1997. This report set out a national strategy to tackle the problem of violence against women, including the provision of counselling and support services to victims.</P>
    <P>A national steering committee was established to bring together the expertise of the many non-governmental organisations, statutory bodies and Departments which deliver services to women who have been victims of violence. The committee is chaired by Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace.</P>
    <P>The provision of health, counselling and support services for women victims of violence is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards. In recent years there has been a growing recognition of the complementary roles of the statutory and the voluntary agencies in this area.</P>
    <P>Funding is provided by my Department <i>via</i> the eight health boards to a range of women's organisations including refuges and rape crisis centres. Since 1997 there has been a significant increase in the amount of funding made available to the health boards for women victims of violence. This has resulted in a considerable improvement to these services. An additional £2.3 million or 2,920,397.58 has been made available in 2001 for services relating to violence against women bringing funding in this area to a total of £8.5 million or 10,792,773.67 this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1999 the World Health Organisation produced a detailed blueprint for an influenza pandemic plan. It set out the issues which arise nationally and internationally in relation to a possible future influenza pandemic. A pandemic would have very serious effects in terms of mortality and morbidity. Services such as acute hospitals and general practice would experience greatly increased workloads well in excess of those seen during more regular outbreaks of influenza.</P>
      <P>Last year I established a committee, chaired by Professor William Hall, Director of the Virus Reference Laboratory, to draw up plans to address any future influenza pandemic and to address all relevant issues, including: prevention strategies; surveillance and early warning systems; scientific and medical issues; vaccination policy; pharmaceutical supplies and logistical matters; hospital and community responses; economic, legal and political concerns; communications; and an effective management process.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the plan is at an advanced stage. The draft plan has been updated to take account of recent recommendations from the committee and as a result of the wider consultative process which has now concluded. Later this month the final draft of the plan will be considered by the committee. It is then expected that the plan will be presented to my Department later this year.</P>

      <P>Waiting list figures are collated from figures supplied by the health agencies and relate to the numbers waiting for procedures at hospitals within their areas. This data does not include personal details of patients waiting for treatment. My Department has asked the chief executive officer <Col N="1446" /> at the Southern Health Board to look into this matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times.</P>
      <P>The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment. By the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment. By the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatment for public patients either from the private sector or from abroad.</P>
      <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. The overall target of the new strategy is that an additional 650 beds will be in place by the end of 2002, with an extra 3,000 beds provided over the period to 2011.</P>
      <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospital agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided in the context of the new health strategy entitled, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. A total of 650 of these beds will be in place by the end of 2002. The breakdown by region of these beds is being finalised in consultation with the health boards and the ERHA.</P>

      <P>The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform <Col N="1448" /> of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times.</P>
      <P>The targets set out in the strategy are as follows: by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment; by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment; and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients. It will be a matter for those charged with the operation of the fund to identify the needs and to source appropriate procedures either from private hospitals in Ireland or, if necessary, from abroad.</P>
      <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. The overall target of the new strategy is that an additional 650 beds will be in place by the end of 2002 with an extra 3,000 beds provided over the period to 2011.</P>
      <P>The strategy outlines further measures designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients. A national hospital agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of a high level of prices for tobacco products is an important factor in preventing children from experimenting with tobacco. I support the removal of tobacco products from the consumer price index so as to ensure that price will continue to be used as a key public health instrument in the tobacco free initiative now under way.</P>
      <P>The possible exclusion of tobacco products from the CPI has been raised with the social partners. Substantial increases in tobacco prices impact on the rate of inflation which is central to wage bargaining within the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I hope to gain acceptance from the social partners of a CPI without the inclusion of tobacco products prior to seeking agreement in this area at European level. The EU has a common interest in harmonised index of consumer prices and this is constructed from national CPIs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that attendance patterns at A&amp;E departments are difficult to predict accurately in advance. Periods of exceptional demand can be experienced. I can assure her that every effort is made to keep waiting times to a minimum and that appropriate medical care is provided at all times.</P>
      <P>Hospitals providing A&amp;E services operate a triage system whereby each patient attending an A&amp;E department is assessed and treated in accordance with his-her medical priority. The objective is to ensure that people requiring treatment are treated without undue delay.</P>
      <P>Measures which I have already taken to improve A&amp;E services include the provision of a £32 million or 40.632 million investment package aimed at alleviating anticipated service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. The investment package has been targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of 29 A&amp;E consultants. The recruitment of additional consultants to this key area is designed to reduce any unnecessary delays experienced by patients attending A&amp;E departments and to ensure that patients have improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision-making service.</P>
      <P>Additional funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the ERHA and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted over 700 beds under the initiative and this helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospital.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. On foot of that review the Government has decided in the context of the new health strategy entitled, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. A total of 650 of these beds will be in place by the end of 2002. This additional bed capacity will contribute significantly to a reduction in waiting times in A&amp;E departments for patients deemed to require admission for further care and treatment. The next phase of the review will involve an examination and assessment of clinical activity data by specialty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other initiatives identified in the strategy to improve the operation of A&amp;E departments include: the establishment of 24 hour GP co-operatives as part of the strengthening of primary care which will help reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise have to go to an A&amp;E department; the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and <Col N="1453" /> in-house specialist teams to fast track patients as appropriate; the organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to and availability of services at busy times in A&amp;E departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners for emergencies in acute hospitals &ndash; ANPs diagnose and treat groups of patients independently within agreed protocols; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through the A&amp;E department; the appointment of a member of staff to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at A&amp;E departments; and the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in A&amp;E departments. Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients.</P>
    <P>I have also requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the structure, operation and staffing of A&amp;E services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. Comhairle established an A&amp;E committee to undertake the review. To date the committee has been engaged in an extensive consultation process, meeting and receiving submissions from representatives of each health board, relevant voluntary hospitals, appropriate professional bodies and other interested parties. The committee has also obtained information on attendances in each A&amp;E department from each health board and acute general hospital. It has also reviewed extensive literature regarding A&amp;E services in Britain, Europe, the US, Canada and Australia.

      <P>As asthma is not a notifiable disease, there are no precise statistics available on the number of people with the condition in Ireland. The Asthma Society of Ireland estimates that there are in excess of 250,000 persons with the condition here. This figure includes intermittent sufferers with irregular medication needs.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. There are no plans to extend the scheme to include asthma, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical ser<Col N="1454" /> vices for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, a chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. Even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if a chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Non medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme. Under the drug payment scheme no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>The number and regulation of consultant posts is a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal in the first instance. The number of permanent consultant posts has grown rapidly in recent years &ndash; 175 since January 2000. There are now 1,615 permanent consultant posts in the public sector funded by my Department and approved by Comhairle. As many as 1,385 posts are currently filled in a permanent capacity and 30 posts have become vacant recently due to retirements-resignations.</P>
      <P>There are 200 Comhairle approved, vacant, permanent consultant posts. The recruitment process being undertaken by the relevant employing authorities is at an advanced stage in respect of 130 of these posts. Approximately 50 new consultants are scheduled to commence duty in these posts in the new year.</P>
      <P>Employing authorities have not yet advanced the recruitment process in respect of the remaining 70 posts, some of which have been created in recent months.</P>
      <P>At the request of the employing authorities, which are the health boards and voluntary hospitals, 180 temporary posts have been created by Comhairle pending the filling of the approved permanent posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on consultant appointment pro<Col N="1455" /> cedures, June 2000, has identified ways of streamlining and speeding up the recruitment process. These recommendations are being considered by my Department and the employing authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 29 accident and emergency consultant posts and 19 consultant anaesthetist posts funded by my Department as part of the winter initiative, 12 temporary A&amp;E posts have been filled and 11 temporary consultant anaesthetist posts have been filled. A review by Comh<Col N="1456" /> airle of A&amp;E staffing and services is due for completion by the end of this year. This review will lead to the creation of a significant number of permanent consultant posts in this sector. The following table outlines the areas in which the winter initiative posts have been created.</P>
    <P>At the request of employing authorities, eight of the temporary anaesthetist posts are being funded by my Department and approved by Comhairle on a permanent basis. Similar applications from other agencies are envisaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic service and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced within the orthodontic service. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, four dentists from the ERHA commenced training in October for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
      <P>It will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £2.340 million or 2.971 million has been approved for the ERHA for orthodontic services this year, of which £1.610 million or 2.044 million will fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable the authority to recruit additional staff. It has also developed an additional six surgery facility and a five surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit, respectively.</P>
      <P>Under this initiative my Department is exploring, with health boards, new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
      <P>The ERHA's chief executive officer has informed me that at the end of the September quarter there were 904 patients awaiting treatment, 11,781 patients awaiting assessment by a consultant orthodontist and 3,288 patients were receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, part of the Government's response to the major challenges posed to the economy generally, by definition including the Shannon region, and tourism in particular in the post 11 September situation, was the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> group to consider the appropriate steps required. This committee includes representatives of a number of Departments including my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise. Discussions are ongoing within that forum.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development, which is the agency under the aegis of my Department with particular responsibility for industrial and tourism development in the Shannon region, is working actively with the key players in the region, including IBEC, ICTU, IDA Ireland and Aer Rianta, on the impact of recent events on the region. In conjunction with IBEC the company has recently initiated a survey among relevant business designed to assess the impact of the slowdown on companies in the region, with particular regard to the cutting back of aviation services at Shannon Airport. The survey will assess the region's continuing ability to influence future investment decisions of mobile international and indigenous investment in the context of the new situation and make recommendations accordingly.</P>

      <P>In the period 1 January to date a total of 18,258 proposed redundancies were notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payment Acts, 1967 to 1991. A breakdown of these redundancies on a month by month basis and by location is provided in the following Appendices I and II.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to job creation for the current year, the information requested by the Deputy is not yet available. The Forfás annual employment survey is carried out in November of each year. This survey will give details of all jobs created and lost in IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and county enterprise boards assisted companies for the period 1 November 2000 to 31 October. The preliminary fig<Col N="1459" /> ures for this survey will not be available until year end.</P>
    <P>Up to recently the agencies remained optimistic about this year's performance by forecasting 21,000 new jobs and a net employment increase of 11,000. We are all aware of the unforeseen factors which have arisen, namely foot and mouth disease, the escalation of difficulties in the IT industry and most recently the tragic events in the US. These factors have combined to significantly moderate the agencies' expectations for the current year. While Forfás expects overall job creation to remain strong at about 19,500 the net employment increase has been revised significantly downwards to 2,400, the bulk of this adjustment being due to increased job losses in foreign owned firms, particularly those based in the US.</P>
    <P>While any deterioration in these figures is disappointing the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. I am confident that we can withstand the present downturn and remain an attractive location for both foreign direct investment and indigenous firms. To this end the Government is continuing to focus on enhancing the country's skills base, improving our infrastructure network, shaping the regulatory environment and encouraging companies to move up the value chain.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to a survey of salmon post-smolts carried out off the west coast in May of this year by the central and regional fisheries boards and the Marine Institute. The purpose of the trials was to determine if salmon post-smolts could be captured at sea in order to examine for levels of sea lice infestation. Similar trials have been carried out in Norway. Trials were undertaken outside Bertaghboy Bay and in Killary Harbour, Clew Bay and Inver Bay. Of a total of 155 salmon post smolts captured during the survey, only one fish showed indications of lice and this was at a low level. The Deputy will be aware that sea lice are endemic in the wild. The data emerging from the survey will add to existing scientific knowledge of the impact of sea lice on salmon post-smolts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>Irish efforts to achieve the maximum support for Aer Lingus from the European Commission have been continuous and unremitting since the Transport Council on 16 October 2001. I have already outlined to the House my own efforts in the build up to that council and therefore I do not propose to go over again all the personal bilateral contacts I made with the Commission and ministerial colleagues or the strong case I made on the day.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate some, but by no means all of the contacts and correspondence with the Commission since 16 October. On almost a daily basis, I have met the Secretary General and other senior officials in my Department to review developments in Aer Lingus and under my direction specific action was put in train. Key contacts are outlined as follows.</P>
      <P>On 17 October, the Taoiseach met President Prodi and the full Commission and outlined the Aer Lingus difficulties and the impact of the events of 11 September on the company.</P>
      <P>On 19 October, the Secretary General led a delegation of officials to meet a group led by the <i>Chef de Cabinet </i>of Commissioner de Palacio and also with Mr. Ayral, head of the Air Transport Directorate, to outline the uniqueness of the Aer Lingus case and to discuss the full range of possible methods of State investment in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>On 24, 25 October and 2 November, my Department supplied information to the EU Commission on Aer Lingus in support of the position as outlined at the meeting on 19 October, including the importance of transatlantic flights to Ireland and Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>On 26 October, the Secretary General wrote to <i>Chef de Cabinet </i>de Palacio and received confirmation by return that the position of the Commission on State aid as indicated by me to the House was correct. This exchange in correspondence was necessary because of press reports, which conveyed a different impression of the Commission's position to that outlined by it on 19 October.</P>
      <P>On 12 November, the Secretary General issued a letter to the <i>Chef de Cabinet</i> of Commissioner de Palacio to update him on developments at Aer Lingus and formally put the Commission on notice that the Irish authorities would make a case for extending the four day compensation package. Later in my response, I will deal specifically with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> On 16 November, my officials attended a meeting of EU Directors General for aviation chaired by the Commission in Brussels to discuss the state of European aviation and in particular the measures put in place since the terrorist attacks. The Irish representatives outlined the case of Aer Lingus and advised that Ireland was keeping all options open to assist Aer Lingus including State investment. My Department is keeping all competition and state aid rules and regulations under review in conjunction with the Attorney General's office. My Department has also engaged on a consultancy basis the services of a former senior official from the Competition Directorate of the European Commission to advise us in this area. My Department will be in a position to make a comprehensive case in respect of any proposal for investment in Aer Lingus, which the Government may wish to make to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government has decided in principle that, provided the survival plan is rapidly agreed and implemented in all its essential aspects, the Government will facilitate private sector interests in an investment in Aer Lingus in order to provide a source of funding to support the survival plan. The Government also decided it should be open to the staff of Aer Lingus to invest further in the airline.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EU position regarding funding for all European airlines including Aer Lingus, I have already outlined to the House the horizontal emergency aid package agreed by the Transport Council on 16 October for all European airlines following the events of 11 September. This package essentially consisted of: compensation for losses suffered by EU airlines as a result of the four day closure of US airspace; coverage for insurance to end of the year; and discretion for states to cover additional security costs.</P>
    <P>Since then, my Department has put arrangements in place in relation to the insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Regarding security costs, my officials are in contact with Irish airport companies and airlines to establish the additional security costs attributable to the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>In relation to the four day emergency compensation, on 31 October, my officials clarified with the Commission certain details in relation to the criteria that may be taken into account when such payments are being assessed by member states and this aspect was followed up in written correspondence.</P>
    <P>On 1 November last, a letter issued from my Department to all Irish licensed airlines setting out the criteria for the emergency aid and inviting submissions. At this stage three claims have been received and a fourth airline has indicated it will submit a claim. One of the claims relates to Aer Lingus and was received on Friday, 23 November. Payments of this claim have been made to Aer Lingus earlier today.</P>
    <P>I still believe the compensation measures for all European airlines for the four day closure of US airspace is minimalist and insufficient given <Col N="1465" /> the impact of the terrorist attacks, particularly when one takes account of the US aid package. I am continuing to press for an extension of this measure and my officials have formally put the European Commission on notice that we will make a strong case for the extension of this measure. Aer Lingus has advised me that it is currently working on an analysis of the full impact of the events of 11 September and will forward its submission shortly. On receipt, I will make a formal case to the Commission. I will return to this matter at the next Transport Council on 6 December.</P>
    <P>On the wider question of State investment in Aer Lingus, the Deputies will be aware that following all our recent contacts and in all its public pronouncements on this issue, the European Commission has been unyielding in its view that any State injection of funds into Aer Lingus would be in breach of the State aid rules. In any event, even if the Government were to go down that road, any such proposal would take a minimum of 12 months to be examined by the Commission. Even if there were a chance of a favourable outcome, we do not have the luxury of such a time frame in which to save Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Commission has indicated it does not see any circumstance where a State investment in the company will meet the market economy investor principle. It has further stated that following a notification of such a proposal, it would invoke the investigation procedure, under the state aid rules, which would take a minimum of 12 months to complete.</P>
    <P>I have been asked on several occasions why we do not apply to invest in Aer Lingus under Article 87(3)C of the EU Treaty, citing exceptional circumstances under the 1999 guidelines. The Commission has said the response to the exceptional circumstances of the 11 September must be on a horizontal basis as agreed at the Transport Council on 16 October. Furthermore, Aer Lingus received aid under this Article in 1993 on a one time, last time basis. The Commission does not foresee any circumstance where it will allow a second derogation for Aer Lingus under the State aid rules.</P>
    <P>We have reserved the right to contest these views of the Commission in relation to any specific proposal, which the Government may decide to formally present to the Commission. However, without agreement within the company on the survival plan, interpretation of the State aid rules becomes academic.</P>
    <P>The next full discussion among European Ministers on the aviation crisis in Europe takes place at the Transport Council on 6 December. I will prepare for that Council in the same manner as I did for the October Council, namely by renewing my bilateral contacts with ministerial colleagues who expressed a degree of support for the position I took at the October Council. I will also press Commissioner de Palacio both before the Council and during the Council itself to propose a more generous package of horizontal assistance <Col N="1466" /> measures for European airlines and one which would better reflect the exceptional nature of the events of 11 September and also the inequity of very substantial assistance to US airlines from its Government.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Aer Lingus announced a range of cutbacks as part of its survival plan which is aimed at addressing the difficult situation facing the company as a result of the dramatic downturn in the global aviation market. Unfortunately, the current crisis does not respect or protect any particular region or service and the Shannon-Dublin route which is operated by Aer Lingus was a casualty of the post 11 September situation with the cancellation of some flights and reduced services on others.</P>
      <P>The PSO regime is governed by EU Council Regulation 2408/92 and the primary purpose of a PSO is to provide air services for people in peripheral or development regions or on thin routes to regional airports where it is not viable for air carriers to provide such services on a commercial basis. In such cases, member states may, with EU Commission approval, establish a PSO on the route and compensate air carriers for losses incurred in operating the route.</P>
      <P>The Shannon-Dublin route is still being serviced by Aer Lingus on a commercial basis albeit on a reduced frequency. I expect that when the financial position of the company improves and the aviation market recovers generally, Aer Lingus and other airlines will again review opportunities for re-establishing services which have been lost or reduced in the aftermath of 11 September.</P>

      <P>Following the dramatic downturn in the global aviation sector as a result of the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September, I requested Aer Rianta to consider initiatives to sustain and grow traffic at the three State airports. Aer Rianta responded positively to my request by offering a range of new incentives, commencing on 1 October 2001, to airlines which launch new routes into Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports. The company improved its incentive schemes at Shannon and Cork by increasing the period for <Col N="1467" /> zero airport charges for new routes from three to four years. The company has also invited proposals for the provision of new domestic and international air services into the State airports, including Cork Airport, and is prepared to provide an attractive package of support to the proposal that is deemed most advantageous in terms of the range and mix of services, the development of the airports and the impact on the regions. In addition, Aer Rianta will provide marketing support for route development promotional activities. I welcome these initiatives by Aer Rianta. They are intended to help reduce the impact of the current global aviation downturn on traffic at the State airports, including Cork Airport, and to boost the Irish aviation and tourism sectors in the months and years ahead.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, the inter-departmental group which was established recently under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach is seeking to identify possibilities for encouraging and generating additional travel by air, increasing the flow of tourists to Ireland and countering the adverse affects of the terrorist incidents in the US. A recent interim report from that group suggested, <i>inter  alia</i>, that Aer Rianta develop appropriate strategies to increase traffic through Shannon and Cork with a view to implementation by next year's tourist season. Aer Rianta has now responded on the various suggestions put forward in the interim report and the company's response is now the subject of further consideration by the inter-departmental group.</P>

      <P>I explained the background to this case in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 210 on 13 November 2001. As I said then, the person in question was medically examined by the Army Pensions Board in August 2001 following which an award of periodic compensation was made to him in accordance with the terms of the relevant compensation scheme. In recognition of the unusual circumstances of the case, it was decided as a concession to backdate the award for six years. Regarding hospital bills, I understand that this aspect refers to the sum of £215 in respect of the cost of the maintenance and treatment of the person in a military hospital as a result of the accident in 1955. At the time, my Department sought to recover this sum from the individual, but, in the context of the recent consideration of his case, it was decided not to pursue this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for special beef premia in respect of 12 animals on 28 June 2001. At an inspection on 31 July 2001 a total of 23 animals were present on the holding. Of those, nine animals over 20 days old were not registered on the database and had no passports. This represents 64.28% non-compliance. One of the nine animals without a passport was also non-compliant with tagging requirements.</P>
      <P>The penalty for greater than 20% non-compliance with identification and registration requirements is loss of all special beef premia and extensification premia on animals for which special beef premia were applied in the 12 months prior to the date of inspection. That includes one application for eight animals submitted on 3 August 2000. Consequently, no special beef premium payments are due to the person named for 2001 scheme and payments made in respect of 2000 special beef premium and extensification premium will have to be recouped. The findings at the inspection were upheld at a review of the case. The person named has been advised of his right to appeal the decision to the headage and premia appeals unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having taken a consistent interest in the Askeaton investigations, the Deputy will be aware of the scale and complexity of this particular exercise and of the fact that it was the largest of its kind ever undertaken in this country. It was co-ordinated and managed by the Environmental Protection Agency, which also dealt with environmental aspects, and involved other agencies such as the Mid-Western Health Board, Teagasc and my Department. Other parties, such as Coillte Teoranta, were asked to assist as required on particular aspects.</P>
      <P>The investigation spanned a range of areas requiring particular specialist expertise, monitoring and analysis, from human health through environmental quality, soil, herbage, feed and water to animal health. Within the context of the overall investigations, each of these areas was addressed by the agency with the competence and expertise relevant to it. For example, human health issues were addressed by the Mid-Western Health Board and animal health issues by my Department. The report on the investigations was published by the EPA on 9 August 2001. Given the work which was necessary to bring the report to a form appropriate for publication, I understand that the EPA could not have published it sooner. It must also be recognised that during the conduct of the investigations, the EPA published a series of progress and interim reports, which provided all interested parties with a picture of how the exercise was progressing. Simultaneous with publication of the final report, the agency presented the report to the people of the Askeaton area at a meeting specially convened in the locality for that purpose. Representatives of each of the participating agencies were present and, after a global presentation had been made by the EPA, each agency representative dealt with that component of the report which was most relevant to his or her agency and answered questions from the local people. I do not know whether any representative of the Consumers Association of Ireland had the benefit of being present at this public meeting to receive the extensive briefing given by EPA and the other participating agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report contains a number of findings and recommendations. As I indicated at the time of its publication, these fall to be considered by the relevant Departments and agencies. Inquiries as to progress in this regard and on further examinations being undertaken should therefore be directed to the individual Departments and agen<Col N="1472" /> cies in question. The CAI document to which the Deputy refers is by and large a series of assertions, statements and questions. These in the main involve the areas of environmental quality and human health which, as far as the investigations were concerned, were areas of speciality dealt with by the EPA and Mid-Western Health Board respectively. It is for these agencies to comment on the points which fall under such headings. As far as animal health issues are concerned, it is difficult to express a view since the CAI comments are essentially assertions or, in one case, a quotation. The final report and the other reports referred to outline the position in relation to animal health and I have the fullest confidence in the thoroughness of the work done by my Department in that regard.</P>
    <P>As to the overall cost of the exercise, the EPA, which managed it, is in the best position to provide a breakdown. My Department's share of expenditure, excluding salaries, was of the order of £1.7 million. A very considerable expenditure of time, expertise and money was undertaken in a committed effort to get to the root of the problems in the Askeaton area which were the reason for this exercise. The investigations were scientific in nature and great care was taken to ensure that findings and conclusions would be scientifically based and therefore justifiable. Those undertaking the exercise could, as is the case with any scientific investigation, work only with the evidence available to them and not on the basis of hypothesis or unsubstantiated theories. The report reflects this necessary reality and I have confidence in it on those grounds. In contrast, no scientific evidence has been brought forward to support some of the simplistic comments and allegations which have come from certain quarters before and since publication of the report.</P>

      <P>The scheme of investment aid in alternative enterprises provides grant aid for housing and handling facilities for horses, deer, goats, rabbits, and other agricultural enterprises not in surplus. In relation to horses, investment items eligible for aid include stables and associated concrete areas, fencing, feed storage facilities, handling facilities, horse exercise walker, all weather gallops, and water supply. The scheme is open to farmers who have a minimum of 30 income units of which at least 20 income units must come from farming and not more than <Col N="1473" /> 200 income units in total; fulfil certain requirements regarding agricultural experience and training; are land owners or have leasehold title to lands on which it is proposed to carry out the development; farm in accordance with good farming practice and submit a business plan in respect of the proposed enterprise.</P>
      <P>The level of grant aid available is set at 40% for applicants with not more than 150 income units and 20% in respect of applicants with more than 150 income units, but not more than 200. The maximum investment ceiling is 31,743, £25,000, per holding in respect of horses and deer and 6,349, £5,000, in respect of other species.</P>
      <P>Application forms and scheme documents are available in the local farm development services office of my Department. There is also a range of supports available to maximise the potential of non-thoroughbred horse breeding and production as a viable farm enterprise. These include grants for the following activities in the non-thoroughbred horse sector which are administered by the Irish Horse Board: stallion performance testing and quality brood mare competitions.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is available also under the quality stallion purchase incentive scheme, which is operated by my Department. Under this scheme a grant of 40% of the purchase price up to a maximum payment of 12,697, £10,000, is available towards the cost of acquiring a quality stallion. Only applicants deemed to have the necessary expertise, resources and facilities to successful manage a stallion will be considered for aid. There are eligibility conditions relating to the stallions purchased. The application form and detailed conditions are being forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of a taxi licence may be written off at the rate of 20% per annum. The cost of the licence is deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 or, if later, the date the taxi trade commenced. The cost of the licence reduces the income of the taxi owner for the purposes of income tax, PRSI and levies. It is not allowed by way of tax credit. Accordingly, the maximum value of the allowance in respect of the licence is the cost of the licence at the taxi driver's marginal rate of tax for the years over which the cost is to be written off.</P>
      <P>I am informed that it is not possible from the information supplied to calculate the actual value of the allowance to the particular taxi owner that the Deputy has in mind, as this depends on the individual's particular circumstances. In addition, some of the allowance will be written off over future years and the value of it will depend on the marginal rates of tax that will apply to the individual for those years.</P>
      <P>The possible tax savings, based on expenditure of £85,000, 107,915, on a taxi licence are set out on the following table. The calculations assume that the income relieved by the allowance in each year would otherwise be charged fully either at the higher rate or at the standard rate. The actual saving in terms of tax would vary where part of the income in question was charged at the higher rate and part charged at the standard rate.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works act as agent on behalf of the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in sourcing suitable accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>As part of a nationwide search for asylum seeker accommodation, negotiations on behalf of the agency took place through 2000 with the proprietors of Havisham House. In the light of developing accommodation requirements of the agency, negotiations were discontinued toward the end of 2000 in relation to the property. No asylum seekers were accommodated in this property.</P>
      <P>Some £42,000 was expended on the property in respect of the preparatory works. This outlay was recouped in full to the State. As the Office of Public Works was engaged in preparatory works on the property and it was the intention to utilise the property for the accommodation of asylum seekers, it was deemed necessary to provide security for the premises and this amounted to approximately £58,000.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): My Department does not routinely collate data relating to the levels of activity provided to patients through the health boards by private providers. However, as the Deputy will be aware, there are established links with the private hospital sector. For example, in the case of the ERHA, services have been purchased in recent years from private hospitals for the treatment of public patients in a number of specialties, including cardiology, cardiac surgery, paediatric cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, ENT, urology and neurology. In other health board areas, services have also been purchased in a number of specialties including ENT, ophthalmology and cardiology. Public hospitals also purchase diagnostic services such as MRI and CT scanning.</P>
    <P>As set out in the new document, Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, I am appointing a national purchase treatment team to manage the new treatment purchase fund which will be used to purchase treatment from private hospitals in Ireland, and from international providers. This team will work closely with the health boards, hospitals and consultants and will seek to build on existing arrangements with private providers to ensure that public patients are offered the treatment they need. </P>

    <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the national task force on suicide published in 1998. Central to that report was the provision of a national suicide prevention strategy which is now in place. The key components of the strategy are: the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups; provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations; and, research into suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>All health boards have appointed resource officers to further the implementation of the strategy within their own areas. Over £3 million, 3.8 million, has been provided since the publication of the task force report for suicide prevention programmes in the health boards and towards research aimed at improving our understanding of this disturbing problem.</P>

I decided that of this, £5 million, 6.349 million, rising to £10 million, 12.697 million, in the year 2002 will be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million, 3.174 million, with a full year cost of £6 million, 7.618 million, for personal assistance services. This means that over 2001-2002, funding is being provided for an additional 312 personal assistants to <Col N="1480" /> provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million, 13.332 million, already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million, 26.03 million, ongoing funding is being made available for the home support services, including personal assistance services. I assure the Deputy that providing the relevant support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible will remain one of my priorities.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The orthodontic initiative is beginning to impact on the public orthodontic service. At the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 16,107 patients in orthodontic treatment, an increase of over 580 patients in treatment when compared with the previous quarter. I am confident that the capacity of the public orthodontic service, in terms of the numbers in orthodontic treatment, will increase further as health boards continue to make progress with implementing their proposals under the initiative.</P>
      <P>In addition to the orthodontic initiative, structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. </P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training in October last for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million, <Col N="1482" /> 1.269 million, was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>

    <P>The chief executive officer has also informed me that at the end of the same quarter, there were 3,288 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service.

The director has taken up duty and will <Col N="1483" /> play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £2.340 million, 2.971 million, has been approved for the ERHA for orthodontic services this year, of which £1.610 million, 2.044 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling the authority to recruit additional staff. The authority has also developed an additional six surgery facility and a five surgery facility at Loughlinstown Regional Orthodontic Unit and St. James's Hospital Orthodontic Unit, respectively.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

The estimated total cost of site acquisition and construction is approximately £3.0 million, 3.81 million. Decisions in relation to the prioritisation of funding for projects within the overall allocation available under the national development plan are a matter for each health board in the first instance. On the case of the proposed community nursing unit at Ballinrobe, the Western Health Board was of the view that other capital projects warranted a higher priority and the necessary funding is not, therefore, available under the national development plan. I am, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, currently exploring alternative options for funding developments such as that proposed at Ballinrobe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the strategy, section 80, page 102, identifies a need for an independent agency which can provide expert, objective advice on specialty distribution, bed distribution, the future configuration of existing hospitals and the priority attached to the development of individual services and specialties in acute hospitals throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na n-Ospidéal is an independent agency with the statutory function of advising the Minister for Health and Children on each of these issues. Since 1972, it has published 80 reports on the development of hospitals and individual specialties. Comhairle also regulates appointments of consultants and senior registrars.</P>
      <P>The functions of the National Hospitals Agency are set out in the health strategy as follows: to prepare a strategic plan for expanding the capacity of acute hospitals; to advise on the organisation and development of all acute hospital services; to advise on the designation and funding of national specialist services; to facilitate closer linkages with the private hospitals sector; to liaise with regulatory and professional bodies on matters affecting acute hospitals; and to manage a new national waiting time database.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the national hospitals agency will have implications for Comhairle na n-Ospidéal. The implications in this regard will be examined as part of an independent audit of the functions and structures of the health system. The audit will consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the number and <Col N="1485" /> configuration of existing bodies and agencies in the health system and the scope for rationalisation. It is envisaged that this audit will be carried out by independent consultants and will be completed by June 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, which I launched recently provides a framework, <i>inter alia</i>, for a reform of the acute hospital system which will lead to improved access to hospital services for public patients. It also provides for a comprehensive set of actions to be taken to address the issue of waiting lists, and particularly waiting times for public patients. </P>
      <P>The strategy places a new focus on waiting times. The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002, no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment; that by the end of 2003, no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment, and that by the end of 2004 no public patient will wait longer than three months for treatment. Until these targets are achieved, a new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatment for public patients. </P>
      <P>The single most limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context, a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review, which has informed the health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. The overall target of the new strategy is that an extra 3,000 beds will be provided over the period to 2011, with 650 beds to be in place by the end of 2002. The next phase of the review will involve an examination and assessment of clinical activity data by specialty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures which I have already taken to improve access to accident and emergency services include the provision of a £32 million, 40.632 million, investment package aimed at alleviating anticipated service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. The investment package has been targeted at a number of key service <Col N="1486" /> areas, including the recruitment of 29 accident and emergency consultants. The recruitment of additional consultants to this key area is designed to reduce any unnecessary delays experienced by patients attending A&amp;E departments and to ensure that patients have improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision making service. Additional funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the ERHA and the health boards contracted over 700 beds under the initiative which helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospital.</P>
    <P>Initiatives identified in the health strategy to further improve the operation of A&amp;E departments include the establishment of 24-hour general practitioner co-operatives as part of the strengthening of primary care which will help reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise have to attend at an A&amp;E department; the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to and availability of services at busy times in A&amp;E departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, in acute hospitals &ndash; ANPs diagnose and treat groups of patients independently within agreed protocols; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through the A&amp;E department; the appointment of a member of staff to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at A&amp;E departments; and the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in A&amp;E departments. Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients. </P>
    <P>I have also requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the structure, operation and staffing of A&amp;E services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. Comhairle established an A&amp;E committee to undertake the review. To date, the committee has been engaged in an extensive consultation process, meeting with and receiving submissions from representatives of each health board, relevant voluntary hospitals, appropriate professional bodies and other interested parties. The committee has also obtained information on attendances in each A&amp;E department from each health board and acute general hospital and has <Col N="1487" /> also reviewed extensive literature regarding A&amp;E services in Britain, Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. I am informed by Comhairle that it is expected that the committee will complete its report by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The 2001 annual report of the European Centre for Drug and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, notes that Ireland reported a substantial upward trend in drug related deaths in recent years. However, this trend does not appear to have continued in 1999. In 1997 there were 55 drug related deaths in Ireland; there were 99 such deaths in 1998 and 80 in 1999.</P>
      <P>Comparisons between countries should be interpreted with caution as not all countries use the same criteria. The drugs misuse research division of the Health Research Board is working with the EMCDDA to apply a new drug related deaths standard definition. The intention would be that this standard definition would be applied across EU member states and thus allow for the comparison of data. The drugs misuse research division has also set up a working group to examine ways of improving the reporting of drug related deaths in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EMCDDA report also shows that the number of new cases of Intravenous drug users who tested positive for HIV increased from 26 new cases in 1998 to 69 new cases in 1999. In 2000, the number of new cases in this category increased by one to 70. We must not become complacent about this infection. While cases of and deaths from AIDS are decreasing as a result of new treatments, the number of new cases of HIV is increasing in all categories. HIV is strongly linked with intravenous drug misuse. To respond to this health board services include methadone treatment and needle exchange in the <Col N="1488" /> range of services for drug misusers. These services have seen significant expansion in recent years. </P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy 2001-2008, which was launched this year by the Taoiseach, contains 100 actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research which will have a positive impact on the health status of drug misusers.</P>

      <P>The management of orthodontic treatment waiting lists is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The number of patients on the orthodontic treatment waiting lists returned to my Department by the health boards show that there was a decrease of 4.75% in the numbers on their waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in the 12 month period ending September 2001. In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards have also informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 16,107 patients in orthodontic treatment, an increase of over 580 patients in treatment when compared with the previous quarter. I am confident that the capacity of the public orthodontic service, in terms of the numbers in orthodontic treatment, will increase further as health boards continue to make progress with implementing their proposals under the orthodontic initiative.</P>
      <P>In addition to this initiative, structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North-Eastern Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training in October last for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics, and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of <Col N="1489" /> a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a Professor in Orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million, 1.269 million, was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 148 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The total number waiting for cardiac surgery as at 30 June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was 420. This represents a decrease of 52% over the period 30 June 2000 to 30 June 2001.</P>
      <P>The total number waiting for ophthalmic procedures nationally at 30 June 2001, as reported by health agencies, was 2,855, a decrease of 863 since 30 June 2000. The total number waiting for orthopaedic procedures at 30 June 2001, as reported by health agencies, was 4,264, a decrease of 700 since 30 June 2000. Some hospitals did not provide details of the procedures to be carried out within the specialties of ophthalmology and orthopaedics, therefore, the total number waiting for cataract operations and hip operations as at 30 June 2001 is unavailable to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> The number of people on public hospital waiting lists in June 2001 was 26,659. This figure represents a decrease of 5,192, or 16%, on the comparable figure for June 2000. Considerable progress has also been made in reducing waiting times. The number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment and the number of children waiting more than six months for treatment in the target specialties have both fallen by 20% in the same period. Reductions in waiting lists have been achieved across each of the health board regions in the period June 2000 to June 2001.</P>
    <P>The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times.</P>
    <P>The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. Until these targets are achieved a new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients either in the private sector or, if necessary, abroad. </P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. The overall target of the new strategy is that an additional 650 beds will be in place by the end of 2002 with an extra 3,000 beds provided over the period to 2011. </P>
    <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospital agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public systems.</P>

      <P>As part of a major investment package, capital funding under the national development plan has been provided for phases two and three of the major development at Naas General Hospital. Phase two commenced on site in November 1999. This element of the project is approximately 20 weeks behind schedule. However, it is anticipated that it will be completed within budget in August 2002 and that commissioning will commence immediately on completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase two will provide enhanced bed capacity for the hospital and includes the following facilities: main entrance concourse, administration &ndash; part, medical records department, chaplaincy department, outpatients department, accident <Col N="1492" /> and emergency department, physical medicine department, radiology department, pharmacy department, geriatric day hospital, operating department, day services department, intensive care and coronary care units, inpatients wards, geriatric rehabilitation and assessment ward, staff changing, brought forward from phase three, on call accommodation, brought forward from phase three and stores brought forward from phase three. </P>
    <P>Phase three will complete the total hospital development and will include construction and completion of the following departments: administration &ndash; completion, pathology, hospital sterile supplies department, central supplies department, catering department, engineering and maintenance department, day services &ndash; permanent, physical medicine &ndash; permanent, outpatients department &ndash; completion, mortuary and post-mortem facilities and waste management department.

      <P>A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. On foot of that review, the Government has decided in the context of the new Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. A total of 650 of these beds will be in place by the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>The staffing of hospitals is primarily a matter for the health boards and voluntary hospitals. Hospitals are funded and staffed to perform a certain level of activity. However, in recent times staff shortages have arisen for many reasons, not least have been the significant developments in the health service following the additional fund<Col N="1493" /> ing which has become available as a result of the expansion in the economy. New measures have been and continue to be adopted by hospitals to fill all vacancies and I am confident that much progress has been achieved in this area.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The availability of sufficient skilled and qualified personnel is clearly central to the adequate provision of quality health and social care services in the community. Where specific shortages of qualified staff exist at present, a number of initiatives have been undertaken to support recruitment and retention. </P>
      <P>As part of my overall nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention strategy, I have introduced public health nurse specific initiatives, including payment of enhanced salary and college fees, in return for commitment from student public health nurses to work as public health nurses for at least two years following qualification with the sponsoring health board and the provision of 25 additional student places with effect from 2001-2.</P>
      <P>A strategy for nursing and midwifery in the community is being developed under the auspices of the primary care strategy. It will address the deficits in the current system by providing a plan for the integration of nursing and midwifery services within primary care and build on the existing diversity of nursing and midwifery competencies currently provided by public health nurses, practice nurses, general nurses, midwives, community mental health nurses and others. The strategy will seek to maximise the use of nursing and midwifery competencies in the provision of a needs led, high quality and sustainable primary care service. The target date for publication of the strategy for nursing and midwifery in the community is the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding how current national and international shortages are affecting the provision of therapy services nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in this area to 2015, was published in July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. </P>
    <P>Following publication in June 2000 of the report by the national social work qualifications board entitled, Social Work Posts in Ireland, officials of my Department along with officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority agreed that additional training places in social work were required. A number of extra places have been provided this year and further increases are planned for next year. </P>
    <P>In relation to community welfare services, the number of community welfare officers employed by health boards is maintained at an adequate level to provide for the effective delivery of services. In this respect, additional officers have been recruited to deal with the increased workload arising from increased numbers of refugees and asylum seekers in recent years.</P>

      <P>I assume the question relates to the recruitment of driver testers. Since November 1998, my Department has recruited an additional 41 permanent driver testers, and 22 contract driver testers, as well as an additional three supervisory driver testers. There are no plans at present to recruit additional permanent or contract driver testers. However the situation will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The dispute in the Department's office in Letterkenny arose initially out of the filling of three additional temporary posts in the office by the recruitment of staff on short-term contracts. The staff are required for a limited period for work associated with the introduction of a new system for the delivery of child benefit from that office. In addition to child benefit, the office also administers treatment benefit which comprises dental and optical benefits and medical appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial action, which involves 157 clerical staff, commenced on 2 October 2001 with a ban on dealing with telephone and fax inquiries and a withdrawal of availability for overtime working. The action was extended on 30 October 2001 to include a ban on a range of other tasks and withdrawal of co-operation with the implementation of a new computer system for child benefit. While the industrial action is preventing <Col N="1498" /> people from making telephone and fax inquiries in relation to entitlements, I would emphasise that claims continue to be processed and payments continue to be made.</P>
    <P>I regret the inconvenience to the public arising as a result of the industrial action and I wish to stress that every effort is being made by the Department to bring about a resolution of the dispute. In this context, following a recent meeting between officials of the Department and the union, there have been ongoing contacts with a view to putting together a draft agreement aimed at bringing about a resolution of the dispute. Further contacts are expected to take place over the coming days, which hopefully will result in the cessation of the industrial action. </P>

      <P>I note the Deputy's concerns about the inclusion of transport issues in the proposed Disabilities Bill. The Government is already committed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the National Development Plan to ensuring that progress is made towards a more accessible public transport system. I am grateful to my colleagues, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, for their work in this regard which includes the following key developments: all DART cars are accessible and new DART cars will have audio-visual announcements; Bus Átha Cliath currently has more than 300 low-floor accessible buses and will only purchase such buses in the future; and Deputy Molloy has announced his intention that by the end of 2003 the process of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible will commence.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to reveal in detail, at this stage, the contents of the Bill. However, I can say that the Disabilities Bill will be broad-based in its approach, focusing on positive action measures to support access and participation by people with disabilities in society. Public transport is one of the key areas where barriers to people with disabilities exist. I am anxious to ensure that the Disabilities Bill will address access in relation to transport with a view to making mandatory provision in respect of accessible public transport. Accordingly, I can assure the Deputy that the Bill will include a range of appropriate measures to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 175, inclusive, together. </P>
      <P>My Department has sole statutory responsibility for the provision of residential services for children up to the age of 16 years who have been convicted by a court or placed on remand by a court. There are five young offender centres under the aegis of my department. A programme to upgrade and modernise these facilities is currently under way. </P>
      <P>From time to time difficulties may arise accommodating individual children on the first date on which a placement is sought in a particular unit due to pressure on places on a given day. In general the child in these circumstances is either subsequently placed in the unit or in one of the other facilities as an alternate to, or pending the availability of, a place in the original unit of preference. The operational capacity of these facilities may fluctuate from time to time to facilitate refurbishment and new developments. Capacity is also reduced where a centre is required to make special arrangements to cater for a particularly difficult child.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned an independent audit of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this audit is to ensure that there are sufficient residential places available to meet the needs of the target group in the short, medium and longer term. A consultant has been appointed and it is expected his report will be available early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's commitment to children at risk is evidenced by the measures contained in the Children Act, 2001. It proposes a modern statutory framework for the development of the juvenile justice system. In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts, including the obligations of the centres under the aegis of my Department, the legislation will provide for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or with serious care needs. It also provides for the establishment of the special residential services board. The special residential services board will work in close co-operation with all relevant bodies, to facilitate and ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services <Col N="1503" /> to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders are made.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 247 of 21 November 2001, his attention has been drawn to the fact that the school in question has been in temporary buildings for the past five years and that the school's application has been at stage three since July 2001; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the Tánaiste made a statement during the summer that the school would be considered for a public private partnership; if this is the case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question is currently housed in temporary accommodation. A letter approving the stage two submission for the new school project was issued to the client, County Dublin VEC, in July 2001. To date, a stage three submission has not been received in the building unit of my Department. This project cannot be considered for the public private partnership scheme as a design team has been appointed and architectural planning has commenced for the project.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the child referred to by the Deputy. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in that area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties which pupils might experience and which may <Col N="1505" /> present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports that might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible. In order to progress this case further, a questionnaire has issued to the child's mother, which has helped identify his educational needs and provides my Department with her written permission to contact schools and NEPS on behalf of her child. The advice of my Department's inspectorate is being sought in this case, and every effort is being made to find a suitable school placement.</P>

      <P>Funding at the disposal of the youth affairs section of my Department is designed principally to ensure the provision of non-formal educational opportunities for young people. To do this, grant-aid is provided to youth organisations at national level under the youth service grant scheme, to special youth work projects that assist disadvantaged young people, and to youth clubs and groups through the local youth club grant scheme. Due to the large number of existing commitments in the youth sector this year, it is not possible to accede to the request for interim funding from the Ceol project. Application forms for the year 2002 have issued to all administering agencies, in this instance, City of Dublin VEC, and an application from the Ceol project can be considered together with all the other applications received in the context of funds available in 2002.</P>

      <P>The planning and steering group was set up on 27 January 2000 in order to develop, advise on, facilitate and monitor the process of establishing the proposed Irish Academy for the Performing Arts. The group met on a number of occasions and examined a wide range of issues in relation to the establishment, organisation, development and structure of the Irish Academy for the Performing Arts. At its last meeting in February 2001, the group identified two key next steps in the development of the academy, namely the appointment of a governing authority and the <Col N="1506" /> appointment of a president. On 30 July 2001, I announced the appointment of Ms Carmel Naughton as chair of the interim governing authority of IAPA. I have since met Ms Naughton to discuss the development of the project and the establishment of the interim governing authority. I expect to be in a position to announce the membership of the authority shortly. The appointment of a president will be a matter for the interim governing authority.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of my Department's free fees initiative, the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>Eligibility under the initiative is subject to a number of conditions. For example, students who are repeating a year level or who already have a degree are generally not eligible for funding.</P>
      <P>Universities are autonomous institutions and, where a student is not eligible to benefit under the free fees criteria, as in the case referred to by the Deputy, issues relating to the payment and refund of tuition fees are a matter for each university.</P>

      <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers has been brought to my attention. The editor of textbooks and activity books selects the content of <Col N="1507" /> such books. The material selected for inclusion in textbooks reflects the personal preferences of the editor. When selecting material for textbooks, editors are required to follow guidelines drawn up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to ensure that the textbooks conform to the requirements of the curriculum. My view is that editors should follow the specifications for textbooks provided by the NCCA, including the need to ensure the appropriateness of the selec<Col N="1508" /> ted material to the age and the developmental level of the pupils for whom the books are intended.</P>
      <P>I am referring the issues raised by the Deputy to the NCCA to see if its guidelines for publishers address the concerns of the parents. I have also asked the textbook committee of my Department for its views on the issues raised by the parents. However, the parents should bring the issues of concern to them directly to the publishers of the textbook and to the school authorities.</P>
