    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 the Government established a Cabinet committee on infrastructure and public-private partnerships. The Cabinet committee is supported by a cross-departmental team of senior officials. The cross-departmental team is chaired by an official from my Department and includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the cross-departmental team is to support the Cabinet committee in its task of providing a strong central focus for delivery of key infrastructure and to ensure any obstacles to delivery are tackled in an effective and co-ordinated fashion across all Departments and agencies. The team meets at least once, and sometimes twice, each month. I wish to emphasise that responsibility for infrastructural projects under the national development plan still rests with the relevant line Departments while the Department of Finance is responsible for co-ordinating the plan as a whole.</P>
      <P>A progress report prepared by the cross-departmental team was published in April following its submission to the Cabinet committee and Government. Copies of the report have been laid in the Oireachtas Library. The progress report summarises the very good progress to date in implementing priority infrastructure elements identified by the team. It also identifies some key challenges which will be addressed by the team in the period ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the Department of Finance estimate that the cost of infrastructural projects under the national development plan will increase by 50%? Against this background, is he of the opinion that certain key projects will have to be dropped, or will additional finance be provided to complete the programme? How does he propose to solve the dilemma?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the figure of 50%, I recently described the effect of inflation and construction inflation on a number of projects and that was not the figure I outlined. In the first expenditure and infrastructure programme, this year there will be an increase of almost 30% on <Col N="1039" /> last year's out turn and, while there was considerable inflation in construction projects last year and this year, we believe the programme will stay on course. Most inter-urban roads, except the Waterford road, should be completed by 2006. The Waterford bridge and road will be completed in 2007. Last year 95% of the expenditure on projects was reached on target and that will also hopefully be the case this year. It is too early to say to what extent that will happen over a seven year period, though there is no doubt price inflation and construction inflation will eat into the overall costs of the projects. The national development plan is on target, however, and if we can maintain the 95% figure over this year it will remain so. Some areas may require additional finance but it is too early to indicate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance has estimated that the cost of key projects over the first four years of the plan will increase by 50% and that leaves the Taoiseach with the dilemma of either dropping projects or increasing funding. Obviously he does not have information on that in his brief and I will return to it on another day.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the advice coming from the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency is that public private partnerships could be financed more cheaply by the State than by the private sector? The NTMA can borrow money 2% cheaper than proposed by the typical public private partnership. Is the Government now disposed to amending public private partnership proposals whereby, instead of looking for proposals to finance, design, construct and manage, the State will take over financing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is ongoing debate on this issue. I know the view of the Department of Finance and of the National Treasury Management Agency is that the State always borrows cheaper than anyone else and all programmes should be under the capital programme. Discussions with the social partners and public private partnerships are just completed and agreement has been reached on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private sector working with the State can often do a job far quicker. We have already seen a number of the projects in education and the first two road projects, the Waterford road and the Kilcock to Kinnegad road, are at tendering stage. The PPP element of the Limerick ring road will go to tender shortly and construction of the second West Link bridge commences this month. Most elements of the national development plan are public private partnerships, worth £1.6 billion, and some would argue it should be more. The design, construct and management function is not relevant for all projects but PPP is quicker for some schemes. The National Treasury Management Agency would be the first to admit that putting all this into capital programmes when trying <Col N="1040" /> to do so much work will not construct these any quicker than the normal, traditional way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>While an argument could be made that PPPs would be quicker, in respect of roads we do not have any evidence of this. Even though the Taoiseach is leading his Government into a fifth year in office, not a single road has yet gone through the PPP route. Is he aware that 11 major road projects under the national development plan are to proceed by way of PPP and that the National Roads Authority is committed to applying tolls to these roads? How can he justify tolling some roads, especially when many of them serve the more disadvantaged areas, and not others? In view of the present financial situation and the large budgetary surplus there is no necessity to toll roads. Will the Taoiseach announce that PPP roads will not be tolled and that the 11 roads in question will continue to progress by way of PPP but that tolls will not apply? It is blindingly unfair that certain towns will be served by toll roads and others will not. This will grossly disadvantage towns which seek to establish industry if every tonne of product coming out of a factory has to pay a toll on the way out and every tonne of raw material must pay a toll on the way in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of tolls, it is estimated that the private sector will invest about £1 billion through PPPs. I have already mentioned the areas concerned: the inter-urban routes such as the Waterford, Limerick and Kinnegad routes which are at the tendering stage. The national development plan sets a target of providing motorways or high quality dual carriageways between Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and the Border. Finance raised through the PPPs is an essential part of the programme which would not work otherwise. Shadow tolls would require the Government to pay a toll for every motorist who used the roads or bridges. This would not raise any revenue for the State or fund any road construction in the future. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, it is not in prospect in the short-term, though I have heard arguments that they are widely used in other countries. Motorists who choose to pay tolls will receive a higher level of road service while there will also be the option of using older, untolled roads for those unwilling to pay the toll. We will not see the development of modern roads everywhere if there is not at least some tolling. The power to levy tolls is vested in the NRA and the level of toll is set on the basis of detailed research by that body. Deputy Noonan's point is that the NRA will start hitting small towns or small roads which will not be economic but will look after the likes of Kinnegad or Limerick. It will not start with bypasses and short roads; the whole object is to get the interurban network throughout the country up to a state-of-the-art level after years of neglect. Public-private partnerships are part of this process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hear what the Taoiseach is saying. Is it the policy position that the Government is committed to applying tolls to the 11 major roads in the country which in the national development plan are planned to proceed by way of PPP? Is that the policy position? Will he toll the 11 major roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, but there are only two at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two at this stage, the Waterford road, the Kinnegad road and the Limerick bypass. In fact, there are three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are gone to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The PPP element of the first two projects &ndash; the Waterford road the Kilcock to Kinnegad road &ndash; are at the tender stage. The PPP element of the Limerick road will go to tender this month. The West Link bridge commences this month. They are all PPP issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach plan to toll these roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has to be a return where there is public private partnership involvement. Otherwise, it would not be possible to continue road-building. That is the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions arising from the Taoiseach's contradictory replies. How can he say the programme is on target while conceding that there has been substantial inflation in construction costs? The last two years saw construction inflation of close to 25%. This is five times the national average rate of inflation. If the programme is on target, something has to give if the inflation rate is of that order. Either the number of construction projects or the amount of money to be added must change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question arises from discussions I had yesterday with a group that met the Taoiseach and Deputy Noonan &ndash; the N8 Action Group. There were representatives of another action group on the radio this morning in relation to Fermoy. Is the Taoiseach aware of the massive democratic deficit that has emerged in our society? The NRA has responsibility for road projects but it cannot be questioned. If a Deputy puts down a question to the Minister for the <Col N="1042" /> Environment and Local Government in the House, he or she is told quite properly by the Ceann Comhairle's office that the Minister has no responsibility for the NRA. However, if the NRA is contacted directly, it will state it is implementing Government policy.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate how he proposes to communicate with the communities directly affected by these road proposals, in respect of the preferred routes and in relation to either hard or soft tolls? Is the Taoiseach aware of the problem? What does he propose to do about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that very good progress was made last year, the first year of the seven year programme. It was 95% on target. There is price inflation and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has acknowledged that. He has published material on a number of issues, including the action plan on construction capacity published on 5 June 2001. That includes 50 measures to expand capacity. There have been visits to France, Germany and the US to promote opportunities for foreign contractors. Large numbers of inward delegations and contractors are here working on a number of the roads.</P>
      <P>FÁS has been recruiting planners and construction staff through its Jobs Ireland Roadshow. Town planners have been brought in and their numbers are increasing through training at third level institutions. Building procedures are being reviewed and large projects are attracting outside contractors. A range of issues needs to be considered. I accept there has been price inflation but it is not eating into the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How are we on target?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are 95% on target for the first year. Most road projects, including the NRA road projects, are on target. Sewerage and water schemes are also on target. The prices are higher than visualised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a higher spend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a 30% increase over last year on the national development programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the overall national development plan cost more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that seems likely. The Department of Finance has rolling figures for the three year plan. No policy change has been worked out, but it is to cost 30% more this year than last year. That is the projected figure to complete the programme. More activity in the market and tendering process will help. I met a number of the groups and I am aware of the issues, although it would be more proper if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government dealt with this. At local level I have seen the NRA and local groups working together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1043" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the NRA sometimes refuses to meet local groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am. A fortnight ago I saw groups working hand in hand with the NRA in Donegal. I cannot answer for their procedures or how they follow them. It seems, in some cases, they are working together but in other areas they are not. I have met some of those groups. There is a conflict on the issue of acquiring land. Discussions are ongoing between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the NRA about obtaining land for major projects. It is important that these issues are resolved otherwise the CPO process on major roads, not to mention the difficulties of residents will not be satisfactorily dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concern that the programme to which he is committed, and to which the taxpayer will contribute millions if not billions of pounds, will inevitably be delayed if there is not proper consultation and dialogue with communities directly affected? There is a democratic deficit between the accountability of the NRA to elected members in this House or to county councils. The Minister with responsibility for voting moneys through here says he has no responsibility for the day to day consultation in which the NRA may engage with local communities. Does the Taoiseach agree that court actions taken by groups of concerned citizens who feel they have not been properly consulted, exercising their rights on the N11 in the Glen of the Downs or elsewhere, will seriously delay projects? Does he accept what the NH action group have said about what is happening in Fermoy and what many other groups around the country have said, that there is a gap, which if not filled by democratic politics involving local representatives and communities, will occupy the space and time of the courts with consequent delay? Surely it is the responsibility of this House and the Government to avoid such unnecessary delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is much better to have consultation rather than court action and the ensuing delays. In many of the major projects the consultation with the design teams, consultants, the NRA and local authorities is extremely good. I admit that it is not the same everywhere. We are now trying to take far bigger blocks and it is important that those involved work together to resolve the issues. Many colleagues in the House have told me that consultations work extremely well. Some of the farming lobby and Members want the CPO process in particular to be dealt with. There are consultations going on. It is far better that consultations take place on road lines and the processes and that the organisations work together to achieve this. It is a much quicker and more efficient way than going through the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that the research published today by the Fermoy bypass group on the tolling of national roads complements what I have said here before? Does he agree that public private partnership is nothing more than a transparent scam to divert large amounts of money from ordinary people into the coffers of major construction companies and big business interests &ndash; West Link is a prime example &ndash; which make astronomical profits from deals of the kind to which I refer? Is the Taoiseach aware that the figures and projections published today by the Fermoy group relating to the proposed bypass in question and covering a 30 year period show that £821 million will be collected in tolls on foot of an input of approximately £63 million? If these figures were extended to include the 11 other road projects which may come under these schemes, approximately £13 billion would be collected on foot of an input of £1 billion.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that he might as well give big business and construction companies their own private diamond mines? In this instance, it is the coffers belonging to the people that are being robbed in order to allow the people concerned make bloated profits. Will the Taoiseach indicate the reason the Government does not intend to have these projects undertaken by public sector interests? Why, for example, will it not sponsor the establishment of properly financed, regulated and monitored local authority direct construction units which, for a fraction of what big business would charge, would provide good value for taxpayer's money in terms of completing these infrastructural projects? This would ensure the bloated profits of the companies to which I refer and those of the banks which will make a killing on the lending side would not be swelled further.</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that, in terms of house building, the construction industry is utterly irresponsible when it comes to the public good and puts its own profits above it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that only a small element of the entire national development plan will be tied up in public-private partnerships. In addition, West Link, East Link and other infrastructural projects in this city would probably never have been put in place without the involvement of the private sector. These projects were neither conceived of nor put forward in the 1970s or 1980s by local authorities because of the risk element involved. The Deputy will be aware that even in the first two years after its opening it did <Col N="1045" /> not appear that the West Link would be the sort of gravy train which had been predicted. I accept, however, that it has become extremely successful and the construction of the new bridge will help ease traffic problems on the M50.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we should exclude the involvement of public-private partnerships in projects. The capital programme for infrastructure is already carrying enormous volumes of expenditure relating to a huge number of projects and this will continue in the future. The concept of public-private partnerships as they are intended, with the agreement of the social partners, to work in this country and as they work in other countries &ndash; admittedly incorporating different designs &ndash; is extremely useful. Extensive consultation has taken place in respect of the process and a framework, which takes account of people's concerns and will ensure no one is allowed to engage in the type of rip-off to which the Deputy referred, has been agreed. This will provide Ireland with new infrastructure in years to come. To exclude public-private partnerships from projects of all kinds would be a mistake and delay the provision of necessary developments in road, water, drainage and other forms of infrastructure.</P>

Does the Taoiseach not realise that this is invidious and unfair and changes the terms of trade between individual towns in the country? Eleven major road tolling projects are planned under the proposals for public private partnerships contained in the national development plan. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government is absolutely committed to tolling and that these 11 projects will be tolled in the invidious manner described?

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the tunnels and the Deputy's point concerning traffic, I am sure what will happen in Limerick, Waterford and elsewhere is what will happen also with the port tunnel.

        <b>:</b> Would the Taoiseach agree that the public private philosophy being pursued by the Government will penalise communities quite badly? Tolling, in particular, is hugely disruptive to traffic flow, as I know only too well in my own constituency, where traffic jams occur from the West Link back up to Finglas. This is happening because drivers must stop to pay money at a toll bridge &ndash; what an outdated and ridiculous system. Does the Taoiseach agree that tolling to facilitate a public private partnership drives traffic through residential communities to avoid toll costs and, there<Col N="1052" /> fore, inflicts a heavy environmental burden on such communities through traffic congestion and additional air pollution?</P>

Nobody can borrow money or provide national roads more cheaply than the Government.

We should maintain control over our national road network instead of handing it over to multinational bankers and accountants.</P>

        <b>:</b> Why did the Taoiseach not bring to the attention of the House the increase in the cost of Luas from an initial estimate of £250 million to £500 million? Does he acknowledge that the roll-out of broadband services is happening much too slowly and that local authorities often do not recognise the importance and benefit of this technology in terms of dealing with the planning process? Local authorities administrate their planning responsibilities individually. Does the Taoiseach agree a national co-ordinating body comprising representatives of relevant Departments and local authorities is needed to attain conformity, uniformity and a speedy roll-out of broadband technology via the planning process?</P>

Will he make such a statement in his final reply? What is the Government's policy on the tolling of national roads, in particular the 11 major roads designated to be built through PPPs in the national development plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it Government policy to introduce by-laws to force people to use toll roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address the latter two questions first. It is estimated in the national development plan that the private sector will invest approximately £1 billion in PPP projects related to national roads. There is a significant number of projects which are listed in the plan. The NDP sets a target for the provision of these roads and finance raised through PPPs is an essential part of the programme. Shadow tolls and other alternatives would require the Government to pay a toll for almost every motorist who used the roads and would not raise revenue for the State or fund road construction into the future. Motorists who choose to pay tolls will receive a higher level of road service. The policy clearly is there must be a payment for the use of these roads which the NRA is examining. A process has been set down, which is vested in the NRA, and it will be followed.</P>
      <P>By-laws should be laid down in regard to all roads projects, not just those undertaken through PPPs. It is a nonsense, as Deputy Joe Higgins correctly said, that people can drive through estates and cause environmental damage to dodge paying a toll. This happens in many parts of Dublin and throughout the country. Such motorists should not be allowed to do so, particularly truck drivers. By-laws have forced many issues and they could be used to force motorists to use toll roads.</P>
      <P>The broadband programme is very good. Resources have been invested but I am aware the roll-out of the service has been slow in some areas and that the advantage of using this infrastructure and its relationship with investment and jobs has not been recognised. As regards trying to move any of the jobs, most of them have an ICT element and broadband is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Luas line, the Luas contract has increased substantially since it was started. The two south side legs will be started by 2003. The <Col N="1054" /> planning of the other lines is going ahead but that will take a longer period.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Gilmore's point, there are many projects where the State must pay for PPPs. The Minister for Education and Science has four or five projects for which he cannot charge, so the State must pick up the tab over a period. I presume the project to which the Deputy referred is the Ballymore-Eustace PPP where the State must pick up the tab. However, it does not apply to them all. There should be a reinvestment of that return in the future. Admittedly, there are different ways and concepts in relation to tolls. I have seen a presentation which was made to the committee on seven or eight different ways to organise tolls. They do not all have to queue.</P>
      <P>The public sector would not have thought or dreamt of the west or east link at that time, so the private sector involvement was beneficial. I disagree with Deputy Higgins about the private sector. It has an understanding of the local communities it serves and it tries to assist them. It has done that for 20 years. I do not agree with his view that private sector involvement is wrong and that it is only about profiteering.</P>

      <Quest>when the task force report on autism is expected; the progress his Department has made regarding a pre-school education service for children with autism starting at three years of age, the extension of the school year throughout the month of July for children with autism and the doubling of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to receive the report of the task force on autism before the end of this month. My Department is currently engaged in developing proposals for a nation-wide pre-school education service for children with autism. I have already <Col N="1055" /> secured the necessary resources to fund this important development. The intention is that children attending the pre-school service would receive the same level of support as is currently provided in special classes for children with autism in primary schools. This will involve a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and the provision of two special needs assistants per class.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the extension of the school year through the month of July for children with autism are at an advanced stage. A special rate of pay will be made available to teachers and special needs assistants participating in the delivery of July programmes. In addition, extra pay will be offered to principals of participating schools in respect of the preparatory work involved in developing July programmes.</P>
      <P>My Department has also advised schools management that a special rate of capitation funding, amounting to one and a half times the normal monthly capitation rate for children with autism, will be paid to schools in respect of pupils participating in the July programmes. Funding will also be available for transport arrangements for participating children. All special classes catering for children with autism should now have received an allocation of two special needs assistant posts per class. If the Deputy is aware of any situation in which this arrangement has not yet been put in place, he might advise me so that any necessary additional support can be provided.</P>

      <P>The Minister will forgive me if I am sceptical about his commitment that the autism report will be available before the end of this month. This is the third occasion in recent months that the Minister has come before the House and committed himself to a deadline which has been broken. Assuming the report will be published and given the composition of the task force on autism, is the Minister satisfied the various methods of educating autistic children will receive a fair crack of the whip? Is he also satisfied that the applied behaviour analysis school of education for autistic children can receive a fair hearing from the task force given its present composition?</P>
      <P>The Minister made a statement that he had secured funding for the pre-school education service for children with autism. That is the easiest part of the work which needs to be done, given the current economic climate. Perhaps he could tell us in greater detail what steps he has taken to roll out the necessary infrastructure and personnel to provide pre-schooling for autistic children from three years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the extension of the school year through July for children with autism, what negotiations have taken place with the interested bodies and partners in education on this issue? Will there be an arrangement between trade unions and other interested groups so that there is certainty at the commencement of the next school <Col N="1056" /> year about the level of service available for children with autism and for their parents?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force on autism was asked to do an urgent job in this area so we could move on as quickly as possible. It has reported to me that it expects to be in a position to provide its report by the end of June this year. The task force has met on a number of occasions and it has received presentations from experts in the field of autism in the United States and Northern Ireland. It has also invited submissions from interested members of the public and it has received a substantial number of responses. The Deputy asked about the applied behaviour analysis. That is one of the issues it will analyse. It will examine the position of that system within the treatment methodologies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about funding and personnel. This is the first time we have gone to the age of three. That was a new departure which meant funding was not provided for it. It has been agreed that funding will be provided. It is a substantial task to set that in motion, but it is well under way. The special education section is under pressure for many reasons, but particularly because the backlog of work is being cleared. We will be moving ahead in that area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me about extending the school year through July. The INTO lodged a special claim. Extra money will be provided under a number of headings. That has been generally agreed with the negotiators, but it must be referred back to the members. That has been done and we hope to hear from them shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the awaited recommendations of the task force report on autism, would the Minister prefer the Department to be prescriptive about the method of teaching which should be applied to children or has it an open mind about service providers being able to compete for business in terms of the education models available to children with autism and to their parents? That is why I asked about the applied behaviour analysis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I hope that the task force report will be helpful in that regard. I do not plan to be prescriptive, and I believe a number of models will be acceptable.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning and building unit of my Department is processing more than 850 major primary and second level schools projects. Work on this unprecedented number of projects is possible as a result of this Government's policy of substantially increasing the level of funding for school accommodation. The projects are a mix of new green field developments and refurbishment and replacement of existing buildings. Last year alone, in excess of £200 million was expended on primary and second level school accommodation. In the current year, it is expected that in excess of £220 million will be expended. Since taking office this Government has quadrupled the capital funding for schools.</P>
      <P>This Government decided that the burden of providing a site for a school should be lifted from local communities and those promoting diversity of school type. I am concerned, however, that developers, particularly in urban areas, are exploiting this progressive decision. I have asked my officials to examine how we can ensure that the price sought from the State for land required for a school reflects the community purpose for which it will be used.</P>
      <P>While my Department is addressing an historic deficit in school building it is not correct to claim that there is a backlog in processing projects. The projects in question are at various stages from initial assessment and approval through to design stages and construction. The extent to which my Department inputs and signs-off varies from stage to stage and depends on the issues that arise as individual projects are progressed.</P>
      <P>Major building projects cannot be delivered in a relatively short period nor is progress contingent exclusively on the internal capacity of my Department. A complex range of factors governs the life cycle of any potential building project from design through compliance with the planning process to construction. My Department sanctions the wide use of external consultants to expedite the design and delivery of the vast majority of primary school projects and all second level projects. However, with the current strength of the economy there are clearly some capacity constraints within the architectural design and construction sectors that are acting as an impediment to a quicker delivery of capital projects.</P>
      <P>The focus of my Department's planning and building unit will increasingly be on ensuring quality, best practice and value for money through an evaluation and audit approach rather than a detailed hands-on involvement in individual projects. The objective is to empower the individual school, as client in any major project, to a greater extent in the ongoing control and management of the design and build stages so that unnecessary delay can be avoided. This approach will also ensure that my Department is better placed to fulfil its strategic overarching role in relation to school building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parallel to the conventional approach to the delivery of major capital works in schools, my Department has been to the fore in advancing <Col N="1058" /> projects under the innovative public private partnership arrangements, envisaged in the national development plan. A preferred bidder has been approved and I expect to announce shortly the placing of a contract for six major educational projects, including five second level schools, under the PPP initiative. Drawing on the experience gained in those projects I envisage greater use of the design, build and operate approach of PPPs into the future. This will further enhance the unprecedented volume of work being undertaken by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that a 10% increase in the capital budget, given the current high rate of building inflation, is nothing to shout about in the context of the budget surpluses that the Government has had for the past couple of years? Will the Minister further accept that there is a significant number of schools at both primary and secondary level that are in a disgraceful condition?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the high level of dissatisfaction among school authorities at the slow progress of building projects from start to finish being processed within his Department?</P>
      <P>Given that there has been an increase in the level of building in recent years, has there been a commensurate increase in the number of staff within the planning and building unit of his Department? Given that external consultants are quite widely used, surely this indicates that the current number is inadequate, and that the Minister will have to look again at the question of staffing within his Department in order to streamline the building projects.</P>

      <P>There is a huge backlog to be made up with regard to the projects, but there are some 850 major primary and second level school projects being processed at present, without any difficulty. There are currently vacancies for architects in the Department, due to the pressure on the public service generally in appointing people, because of the rate of growth in the economy. The volume of work coming through is being handled and the £222 million will be spent and the PPPs will also be developed at the same time.</P>

However, my Department understands from the school that further repair works are necessary.</P>
      <P>In that context, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has now arranged for a technical manager to visit the school to discuss with the school authorities the extent of the works to be carried out to the roof of the building.</P>
      <P>While my Department is prepared to provide this funding and to give any technical assistance necessary, this can only be done in the context of a new lease being agreed between the school authorities and the landlord concerned for a period of five years.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to acquiring a site and to constructing a new Gaelscoil as soon as possible. I have accordingly requested the Office of Public Works to begin an immediate search for a suitable site. My Department will keep the board informed of developments.</P>
      <P>On the second school referred to by the Deputy, an application for capital improvement works and additional accommodation has been received in my Department. The application is being examined in the planning and building unit of my Department. In the course of the examination, account will be taken of factors such as enrolment and demographic trends in the area and the availability of accommodation in other schools in close proximity.</P>
      <P>Pending a decision on the accommodation requirements of the school concerned, my Department will continue to grant aid 95% of the rental cost of temporary accommodation to meet the school's short-term requirements.</P>
      <P>I have asked officials of my Department to finalise this examination as speedily as possible and to notify the school authorities of the decision at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. With regard to Gaelscoil Clonmel, I attended a public meeting last night with the Minister's colleague Deputy Davern, who brought tidings from the Minister. The Minister's proposal to ask the Office of Public Works to look for a site contingent on a further five year lease is entirely unacceptable, and that was the message, loud and clear, from the parents last night.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say if his Department will comply with the report of the architectural manager, Mr. Joe Davis, dated 15 March 1996, where he stated quite clearly that the grammar school is not suitable to the long-term needs of the Gaelscoil? I understand from the Minister that Mr. Davis will visit Clonmel on Thursday, and as is known, the INTO have threatened to go on strike. Will the Minister commit himself not just to purchasing a site and sitting on it for a five year period while the Gaelscoil lease expires, but specifically to fast tracking the design, planning, invitation of tenders and signing of contracts so that the students and teachers, who are currently working in appalling conditions in Gaelscoil Clonmel will be in a position to enter into a new school as quickly as possible? I further ask the Minister, as I was asked to do so at a public meeting last night, if he will meet the board of management and the staff of the school when he will undoubtedly visit south Tipperary and Clonmel over the coming weeks?</P>
      <P>With regard to the second school, this school operates on two campuses, one on either side of a public roadway. That is entirely unacceptable from both an educational and a safety perspective. In that regard &ndash; and I make this argument from the particular to the general in respect of the query made by Deputy Shortall earlier &ndash; the school building programme is chaotic. This is not a reflection on anybody in the school building unit in Tullamore, but it is high time there was a root and branch reform of the way we go about our business in terms of school building. Will the Minister commit himself to fast tracking Rathkeevin national school also?</P>

It was accepted that the Office of Public Works will seek a site but the school wants to see movement in that regard because nothing can happen until the site is obtained.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the financial impediments to participation in education for many low income families due to the high costs of books and uniforms for students entering second level education; if he will take immediate steps to ensure that financial supports are substantially increased to reflect the costs of school participation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned to ensure that the impact of the cost of school books and uniforms for children from low income families is minimised to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Individual school authorities are responsible for drawing up school rules, including requirements in relation to wearing school uniforms. The formulation of school policy for wearing a uniform should allow for prior consultation with teachers, parents and pupils, where appropriate. Equally, such policies should also allow for feedback from parents and for any concerns about issues such as cost to be raised.</P>
      <P>The back to school footwear and clothing allowance, available through the community welfare officers of the health boards, is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. My Department is represented on the group, which is currently reviewing this allowance as part of the ongoing civil service wide series of expenditure reviews.</P>
      <P>I am aware that costs associated with the purchase of school books can place a financial burden on parents. To alleviate this burden, my Department operates a scheme of aid towards the cost of school books for second level pupils from low income families. Principal teachers administer the scheme in schools in a flexible way, based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. I appreciate the sensitive, responsive and resourceful manner in which the management and staff of schools, particularly the principals, operate the scheme.</P>
      <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school textbooks. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of schoolbooks to parents. The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice, for the successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible. My Department also provides seed capital towards the costs of establishing book rental schemes in disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>At second level, in 2000, a total of £4.5 million was allocated in aid towards the cost of schoolbooks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept it is clear that he does not regard this as a priority area, given that there are recommendations from a review group in 1993 which have not been implemented seven years later? Is the Minister aware of what it costs to send a child to secondary school? The Labour Party did a study on that last year and found that the average cost of a uniform is £379 for a child going to a voluntary secondary school, and the assistance available from the State is a mere £78. I put it to the Minister that in <Col N="1063" /> relation to school books, the average cost for a child starting secondary school is £233, and the assistance available through the antiquated scheme set up more than 100 years ago, the school books for needy pupils scheme, has not been brought up to date to go some way towards meeting the real cost of sending a child to school.</P>
      <P>The other opportunity for assisting people with the high costs of school and thereby enabling people to participate at a better rate is the book rental scheme. Will the Minister tell us what precisely he has done in recent years to extend that scheme which has great potential, as pointed out by the review group? What additional money has the Minister put into that scheme and what efforts is he making to ensure that schools participate in the scheme in order to facilitate those students from low income backgrounds? We have talked before about the hopelessly low levels of children from disadvantaged areas who participate in third level. It is clear that unless people can afford to start and continue through secondary school, there is no chance of them staying on to third level. Will the Minister tell us now what, if anything, is he doing to assist people with the huge financial costs, particularly of children starting in secondary school?</P>

      <P>The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192, and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. This will bring the standard <i>per capita</i> grant to more than £200 for the first time. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers a VEC's head office overheads and other activities, apart from the second level programme. The Department does not earmark allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of vocational education committees. The way in which the grant is distributed among schools is a matter for each commit<Col N="1067" /> tee in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. The annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school, such as disadvantaged status, age of buildings and the size of the school.</P>
    <P>The report of the steering group on the Funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. My approach to date has shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to further improving the funding position of second-level schools in light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>

For the first time, I have provided additional funds over and above the capitation grant under a general support scheme and I intend to continue to provide funds where possible to bring them up to the level outlined in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The national educational psychological service is being developed as a dedicated agency to provide an educational psychological service to all primary and post-primary schools. The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and, by the end of this school year, 100 psychologists will be employed in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a <Col N="1069" /> further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, pending the expansion of the national educational psychological service to all schools on a nation-wide basis, measures have been included in the Finance Bill to provide tax relief to parents who find it necessary to engage the services of private educational psychologists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration is also being given to the development of school-based testing measures which will provide a more efficient means of identifying some special needs without the need for recourse to full educational psychological assessments. Special needs teachers are deployed wherever students have been assessed as requiring such support.</P>
      <P>The extent of the Government's commitment to addressing the issue of special educational needs was reflected in its decision of October 1998 that all children with special needs in the primary system should have an entitlement to an automatic response to their needs.</P>

      <P>As a result of this development, the number of resource teacher posts supporting special needs children in the primary system has been increased from 104 to 950. The number of special needs assistant posts increased from 299 to more than 2,000 over the same period. Additional special needs teachers are being deployed on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs and this process will continue.</P>
      <P>Children of second level age with special needs are generally catered for in ordinary second level schools with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. There are 240 resource teachers and 135 special needs assistants at second level at present.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>Where more serious disabilities are involved, the children are catered for in a range of special schools and special classes dedicated to particular disabilities. All such facilities operate at reduced pupil-teacher ratios and attract special needs assistant support in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented and ongoing development of special education services undertaken by this Government will ensure all children with special needs receive the support they require.</P>

      <P>An international adult literacy survey conducted in 1995, and published in 1997, provided a profile of the literacy skills of adults aged 16 to 64. Respondents were grouped by literacy level, which ranged from level one, low, through levels two and three to levels four and five, high. About 25% of the Irish population, some 500,000 people, were found to score at the lowest literacy level, 30% at level two, 32% at level three and 13% at levels four and five. At best, adults with OECD level one skills performed tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text with no distracting information and when the structure of the text assists the task. Level two allows for more complex tasks of locating and integrating easily identifiable information and performing qualitative tasks involving a single operation. Level three was seen by the OECD as the minimum level needed to cope with the demands of everyday life and work in a complex advanced society, while levels four and five were seen as high order skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Funding for adult literacy has been increased from less than £1 million in 1997 to £10.677 million in 2001. The national development plan provides for an investment of £73.8 million to provide for an estimated 113,000 clients in the years 2000 to 2006. Local literacy referral networks have been established and are operated by the vocational education committees. vocational education committees link the adult literacy service with schools, FÁS, welfare, health and employment services, libraries, area partnerships, community groups and employer interests. They promote awareness and provide a structured mechanism for the identification of area needs and the referral of those in need to the service. A directory of adult literacy services has been published, family learning programmes and programmes for specific groups are being expanded. Joint initiatives with the FÁS community employment programme have been developed and workplace literacy programmes are being piloted. Nationally certified staff development programmes have been provided, a quality framework has been developed and an interdepartmental group has been examining how best the literacy service can cater for unemployed people. As a result of these initiatives, the number of people availing of the adult literacy services has increased from 5,000 to 17,150.</P>
    <P>Following successful radio initiatives, a TV series, <i>Read Write Now,</i> consisting of 12 programmes in literacy awareness and tuition for adults, was broadcast last year. It was watched by an average of 155,000 people each week, peaking twice at 192,000. The series was supported by a free-phone help line operated by the national adult literacy agency and free learner-resource packs. Videos of the series are being distributed to libraries, literacy schemes, training centres and video outlets. A radio programme is currently under way featuring more intensive literacy and numeracy tuition. The development of a further TV series is being discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>At least 800,000 people have quite profound literacy difficulties. The targets are significant and the funding has increased from a very low base but this is still a very poor response to a serious difficulty which hinders expansion and development in the economy as well as people's ability to participate in the work force. It is the other side of the coin of educational disadvantage and if pupils are from homes where there are very profound literacy difficulties it will be extremely difficult to maximise the return on the investment in the classroom to students. Will the Minister therefore consider significantly increasing the target audience for initiatives regarding literacy? The current level of 113,000 is missing the point completely. Targeting one eighth of the 800,000 target audience is inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is a major challenge which requires a great deal of money. As the Deputy has admitted the funds <Col N="1073" /> have been greatly increased and almost £74 million is being provided under the national development plan. There are many good initiatives there and further improvements in allocation will be a matter for the estimates in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday the people clearly expressed their view in the referendum. It is a view which has to be respected. I would have thought that the Taoiseach would have at least acceded to the requests for a substantial debate on the issue. The proposal we have is for a limited and closed series of statements which excludes the possibility of many Members expressing their views. Given the nature of what is involved this is undemocratic. It is not acceptable that a matter of this importance should be treated in this way. I urge the Taoiseach, before the Ceann Comhairle rules on the matter, to reconsider. I remind him that not too long ago he proposed to deal with the four issues which were to be the subject of referendums in one parliamentary week. If a message is to be discerned from the events of last Thursday it is that the people do not believe that politicians are listening to them. The House needs to devote serious time to this matter. The proposal is an insult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party is also opposed to this proposal. We believe there was an appalling lack of leadership by the Government in prosecuting the referendum. We further believe that people were antagonised into voting no by some outrageous attacks launched by the Taoiseach on persons on the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side of the debate. The same kind of tactic is being employed today. A closed debate, without a substantive motion, is trying to tie the issue in an undemocratic fashion. We are looking for a substantive motion to debate the issue and an open-ended debate in order that, even at this late stage, the variety of opinion in the House may be expressed.</P>

I ask the Ceann Comhairle to have regard for the outcome of the referendum in ensuring the debate is long enough to incorporate the number who wish to speak on it and representative enough in order that it will give some indication of the views of those who voted to reject the treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach replies, could I add my concerns on the matter? These circumstances are unprecedented. The country has never before voted against a European Union treaty. The Taoiseach will represent Ireland at a Council of the Heads of Government in Gothenburg later this week and we do not have a clue what he will say. He does not have a mandate from the House to speak to the leaders of other Governments on the outcome of the referendum. I propose that there should not only be a series of statements, but also a set of questions to which there would be replies in order that we can obtain a coherent view which represents all the people.</P>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory that there is the possibility of additional time, welcome as that would be from Deputy Noonan's point of view. We need much more than what is proposed by the Government. Accordingly, unless the Government, with the agreement of the Whips, is prepared to suspend business, as we sought in our request to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 31, to deal with this matter without also having to debate for an hour or so the Second Stage of the Local Government Bill, which is hopelessly compromised, and examine what we will do tomorrow before the Taoiseach goes to Gothenburg, the Order of Business is not acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The gravity of this matter is without precedent, but the necessary clarity has not been given by the Taoiseach. It needs to be given in order that we know the debate can continue <Col N="1084" /> tomorrow rather than at some future, unspecified point. Will the Taoiseach take into account that one of the many reasons people gave for rejecting the treaty was the feeling they were not listened to? If he is to be disproportionate in the allocation of time and the Government is to continue to disregard the mandate the people have given it, the Taoiseach will encounter further difficulty in winning the people's support in future referendums. I sound that note of caution because I am sure he does not want to alienate more people than he already has.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of the Order of Business I said &ldquo;a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes&rdquo;. I understand this was taken to mean that the reply would be made tonight. That is not the case. The statements &ndash; the debate &ndash; in whatever format, can continue when the Whips agree.

      <P>How does the Taoiseach think a citizen of this Republic can believe the utterances of any of his Ministers in light of the extraordinary revelations that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, made on the airwaves? Will the Taoiseach confirm that he spoke at length to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, and told him he fully understood his contradictory actions, urging people to vote in one direction when he knew in his heart that he would vote against the same proposal? Will the Taoiseach confirm he said that was all right, that he fully understood the distinction between being a Minister of State and a citizen, and that one could vote one way with one set of responsibilities and another way with another set of responsibilities? Did the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, quote the Taoiseach accurately when he broadcast that gem of information on the airwaves?</P>

      <P>To repeat what I said outside the House, I am disappointed and regret that the Nice Treaty was not passed last week but, of course, I accept the right of the people to vote as they see fit.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must now reflect on the position. Last Friday I asked all the key and relevant officials to examine the various options. Over the weekend I talked at length to President Prodi, other members of the Commission and heads of state. The Minister for Foreign Affairs reported to all the Foreign Affairs Ministers at the General Affairs Council yesterday and to the representatives of the applicant countries today. I will address the European Council on Thursday at the beginning of the Gothenburg Summit on the Irish position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> We must look at all the options and take into account the reasons people voted against the treaty. We will not make any hasty decision. We must examine all the issues to see how best we can build a strategy to deal with the situation. The Nice treaty must be ratified for the enlargement process to go ahead. Between now and the end of the next year, the enlargement process will proceed. Every member state is legally entitled to due process and to follow whatever procedures are in place in its jurisdiction. We must accept that position. We must ascertain what is best for us and try to see how best to handle it. The Government has made no decision and is unlikely to do so for some time.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet Sub-committee on European Affairs will meet tomorrow and will receive a report from the officials involved. I will report on Thursday but we will not make a quick decision on this. We will endeavour to deal with the situation over time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental fact is that this was an exercise in political cuteness that failed. At an early stage, the Taoiseach identified a significant &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote and decided for political reasons not to alienate it. He did nothing to carry a referendum through his Administration or his position and he got caught out. Will he confirm the Minister for Foreign Affairs was informed yesterday that there will be no renegotiation of the terms of the Nice treaty? In precise terms, what will he report to his colleagues in Gothenburg later this week when he addresses them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a preliminary assessment of the situation on Thursday based on what we consider is the position. I will report to the Council the result of the vote and our assessment that we do not believe it was a vote against enlargement. Many of the campaigners and leaders on the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side have made it clear they were not against the enlargement process. They cited many other reasons for voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We will have to reflect on them and see how best we can handle them because we must take into account the right of the people to vote as they see fit.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there was no clever strategy. The only thing I wanted was to have a treaty ratified which I spent an enormous amount of time negotiating. Unfortunately, that was not to be, but it is the way sometimes is in politics that what one would like to see done is not done. I canvassed vigorously for the treaty.</P>

      <P>I confirm for Deputy Noonan that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was told yesterday it was not the intention of the General Affairs Council to renegotiate the treaty. Significant work was put into negotiating it which culminated in four days and four nights of work last December. All the checks and balances in the treaty are delicately poised and cannot be undone. However, the General Affairs Council accepted and respected the difficulty we are in and pledged itself to assist us in dealing with this issue and <i>vice versa,</i> as I hope will the European Council on Thursday, because the last thing any of us want to do is create difficulties for the applicant countries in their desire to join the European Union.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why the introduction of important legislation covering issues such as paternity leave and the rights of workers to be consulted about the future development of their companies, similar to shareholders, was decided by a Minister of State in Brussels without referring back to the relevant committee of this House?

      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn on the information and consultation directive, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, followed Government policy in this area. This issue has been under discussion for several years and the view of successive Governments has been that our procedures and collective bargaining system with the social partners, both employers and workers, should be followed. It was agreed yesterday that it will be left to individual countries to make their own decisions and rulings based on negotiations under the collective bargaining system. That is the best way to handle that because then nothing is forced on a country which is against its normal practices. I understand that yesterday significant amendments, which suit the voluntary system of industrial relations in this country and the collective bargaining system, were included in that directive. If it had stayed as it was for the past number of years, although there have been discussions at European level between employers and unions about this for some time, it would have been more of a diktat. The way it is now is better and more suitable to Irish employers and workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that his Government has successfully deferred the coming into effect of rights for Irish workers which will be enjoyed by other European workers and that that deferral amounts to up to two, if not four years? Does he further agree that what is at issue is the way in which we do our business? If the decision last Thursday sends any message to this House it is that the elected representatives must be engaged and consulted about legislative decisions, because that is what they amount to, which are taken in Brussels and then this House is subsequently presented with <i>a fait accompli.</i> What has happened is that new additional European workers' rights, such as entitlements to paternity leave and other measures covered in the general framework, have been postponed, according to the reports, for up to four years. Is that the case? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision yesterday means that our collective bargaining system can negotiate when and how what happens, with Government approval. It is not the case that we cannot do anything in some of these areas for two or four years. We recently had an industrial relations Bill before the House, which was the conclusion of collective bargaining. It is better to deal with issues which can be dealt with at national level.</P>

Two weeks ago the Taoiseach indicated that was being considered. Is he determined to go ahead with the single Bill and guillotine it in three hours on Thursday and cause division in this House on an issue on which there should not be a division or will he seek to separate the two issues?

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Local Government Bill. I will share my time with Deputy Michael Kitt, if he arrives in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is a continuation of the reform of local government that has taken place since 1996. Some people maintain the Bill is only tinkering at the edges, others say it is going too <Col N="1097" /> far. Until now this debate on the Bill has been dominated by the dual mandate question &ndash; whether TDs should continue to be members of local councils. I am easy in that regard. It is an advantage to be a member of a local authority, particularly when one is starting out in politics and hoping to become a Dáil Deputy. It is a major stepping stone to be elected to this House. Other people contend they were elected to this House without ever being a member of a county council or an urban district council but I believe it is of major benefit. The time has come, however, to deal with the question before us because it has probably dominated the debate on this Bill for too long. I hope that over the coming days, the Minister will outline whether the dual mandate question is to remain part and parcel of the Bill or be removed from it.</P>
    <P>The whole area of local government reform needs to be examined, although I am of the view that councillors generally are not really in favour of getting too much power or of being reformed too much because in most county councils and urban councils, particularly county councils, a cosy arrangement operates on a large scale between the county manager and certain members of county councils. County councillors who have been members of councils for a long time will not take on the county manager but will work with the county manager. At times, county councils in particular can be very frustrating because of this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The whole area of the county manager needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency. The county manager has too much power. He has too many executive functions and is too far removed from the day to day operations of people depending on local government services. In many cases county managers act like tin gods. They build empires and a power base behind them in county halls, more often than not with the support of certain county councillors from all political parties. They operate a system which is not good for local government in the long-term.</P>
    <P>County councils generally serve the public well but there have been many appointments of new committees, SPC committees and county development boards. In Wexford, for example, we have area committees, general purpose committees and sub-committees and I wonder if the staff and county councillors, or urban councillors, will have the time to serve on so many committees. There needs to be an examination of the way the committees operate, and the number of committees, with a view to perhaps having a more unwieldy system because senior officials can become bogged down in meetings with councillors on a regular basis while, at the same time, services to the public are suffering.</P>
    <P>County councils and urban councils, but particularly county councils, operate in a monopoly. The current service from county councils is not good. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the general public in that regard. They find it difficult to get telephone calls returned or <Col N="1098" /> to get appointments and when we raise that issue at county council meetings, we are told it is because of the changeover, that there is an overlapping of the system and that when the new policy committees and the new county development board are up and running, there will be a better local government service to the general public, but I say to the Minister of State that the general public are very dissatisfied with the service they are getting from local authorities.</P>
    <P>Going back to 1996, the Bill, the BLG and the little purple book we received set out to downgrade urban councils. That was wrong. Urban councils throughout the country have served their area population very well but we now find that the county council will be the superior body which will make all the decisions in relation to water, sewerage and other major areas, and that those responsibilities will be taken from urban councils. The way the BLG is being operated is an insult to urban councils and there is much disquiet in urban councils.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of an urban council and a county council for a number of years, with my former colleague on the two bodies, Deputy Ivan Yates. We fought to maintain many of the powers for urban councils but, unfortunately, that was not to be. I have no doubt that the previous Government and the present Minister are continuing to downgrade urban councils. That is not in the best interests of democracy and the Minister should seriously re-examine that issue and continue to enhance the powers of urban councils rather than downgrade them.</P>
    <P>On the salaries of county councillors, at any conference I have attended in the past three or four months &ndash; I do not attend many of them &ndash; I have been attacked by county councillors from all political parties and told that we, as Members of Dáil Éireann, are holding up the payment of salaries. I have not held up the payment of salaries. The Minister should not have tied the payment of salaries to councillors on the basis that the dual mandate had to be removed. If urban councillors deserve a salary, it should be paid, regardless of whether they are TDs. It is important that the role of county and urban councillors is considered in terms of a salary.</P>
    <P>County and urban councillors are doing as much work as TDs did 20 years ago, and deserve to be paid for this work. The best approach would have been to increase expenses, rather than to pay salaries. Salaries will cause problems for councillors who are on disability benefit, unemployment assistance or means-tested payments. A number of councillors will not be able to draw down salaries as they are in receipt of such payments. The Minister should examine the possibility of paying a higher level of maintenance allowance or expenses, rather than introducing a salary. Once such a payment is classed as a salary it will be means tested, taxed and deducted from social welfare payments which councillors are being paid. Not many councillors are in receipt of social welfare, but some good members had to <Col N="1099" /> give up work because of disabilities and so on. Such councillors will find themselves means tested under the proposed system.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider reforming the role of county managers who are too powerful and have little regard for councillors or the public they serve. In my county there will be a county manager and five directors of services on an assistant county manager salary scale. There will be two other layers of administration below these directors which will cost taxpayers a fortune. We will no longer have county engineers, county architects or county planners. This approach is a mistake. We are told the directors of services will be answerable, but I am not sure about this proposal.</P>
    <P>If a councillor attempts to have a road worker appointed, the county manager will look down on him or her as if he or she had two heads. At the same time, senior executives can be appointed. The Minister should examine this, as council road workers and service providers on that level are a diminishing breed who need to be replaced. This service must be built up as such workers, and not directors of services or senior executive engineers, are at the coalface of providing services to the public. However, the Minister and the Department seem to have no problem replacing senior executives.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine certain aspects of this reform which are not in the best interests of local government. We may hold a different view in five or ten years. However, the system which operated in the past was a good one. Some changes need to be made, but making councils top heavy with senior executives will not prove beneficial.</P>
    <P>If councillors are to be paid a salary, they should be paid from day one, rather than linking the matter with the issue of the dual mandate. That is a matter for another day and much negotiation will have to take place before it is resolved. However, local councillors deserve to be paid a decent salary forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing time. The Deputy mentioned that Members of the Oireachtas are being criticised for delaying this Bill. That criticism comes largely from local authority members. I do not intend to delay the Bill more than any other Member, but I accept that councillors are disappointed the Bill has not been passed. That is not to say the Bill will bring about miraculous change. However, councillors are doing a good job and are working hard.</P>
      <P>The Bill will enhance the role of elected members and that is a good description of what is taking place. However, there is a difficulty in that it would be unfair on those waiting payment if a salary is tied in with the dual mandate. Local authority members deserve to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much dissatisfaction with some aspects of local authorities. The example which immediately comes to mind is that of planning offices. I <Col N="1100" /> am most familiar with County Galway, where much of the criticism is due to the fact that there is so much planning activity taking place and so many people want to meet planners to discuss applications. Some applications are of a sensitive nature and councillors and Oireachtas Members find it difficult to hold such discussions because of the high level of activity in planning offices.</P>
    <P>Housing departments of local authorities are also very busy. There are many social housing schemes which have been introduced by successive Governments and there is some duplication with regard to whether health boards or local authorities are responsible for repairs to the homes of elderly people. However, were it not for health boards, many people, particularly the elderly, would be waiting for repairs to be carried out. People wish to see improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing programme has been successful. I pay tribute to those organisations which put forward proposals which are supported by local authorities and communities and which have been of great assistance in the provision of housing, particularly for people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The new county hall in Galway was opened only two years ago, yet the management is considering an extension to the building as there are queues for driving licences, road tax and so on. It is amazing that we have not found some way of dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a local authority in County Galway for 17 years. The last item on the agenda of every council meeting was usually the setting of the date for the next meeting. The usual criticism was that we could hold meetings only on certain dates because some members of Galway County Council were also Members of the Oireachtas. For this reason alone there is a strong argument for ending the dual mandate. County councillors are now members of strategic policy committees which meet regularly and work hard within the committee system. It will be more difficult for Members of the Oireachtas to attend SPC meetings and that is why most members of local authorities want to get on with the job and work the committees. Such councillors argue that if Members of the Oireachtas do their job, there will be no obstacles put in the way of councillors. The Minister is correct to provide that councillors can get on with their work without any restrictions.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with casual vacancies and sets out the procedures to be followed in replacing a member through co-option by resolution of elected councils. The Bill stipulates that the co-optee must be nominated by the same political party which originally nominated the person who caused the vacancy. This reflects current practice.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's argument that there have been difficulties with some local authorities where the co-option is not allowed to the same political party which nominated the person who lost the seat. Ten years ago, when I was appointed as a Minister of State, the Fianna Fáil candidate nominated in my place was not co-<Col N="1101" /> opted. That was not because Galway County Council disliked me or the new nominee, rather it was in retaliation for an event in 1960 when Fianna Fáil took a seat which should have gone to Fine Gael. The pound of flesh has been obtained and I hope we can now return to allowing parties which lose seats to regain them by way of co-option. In some cases, local government members may leave political parties, lose the whip or move to another party. Standing Orders should clearly outline the procedures which should apply in such cases. This would make co-option more straightforward and would do away with the party political bitterness which prevailed in the past when vacancies occurred.</P>
    <P>Section 22 states that town councils with nine members may apply to increase their membership to 12 if the town concerned has a population greater than 15,000. The Minister is seeking to address situations in which town commissions may wish to become urban councils. The Department has hundreds of applications in hand in this regard. The Minister clearly outlined the procedures which will apply under the new legislation following the next elections. I welcome the inclusion of section 22 as it gives a clear sense of direction.</P>
    <P>It is important to appoint a directly elected cathaoirleach for a period of five years as many believe local authority managers have too much power. No great conflict should arise between the cathaoirleach and the manager, they should co-operate to drive forward the county council's agenda in co-operation with the members. I do not see any merit in alternating the position of cathaoirleach on an annual basis merely for the sake of change. The direct election of a cathaoirleach gives people a sense of ownership of local government. The election of the Mayor of London is a case in point. Where a vacancy occurs in the position of cathaoirleach, the leas-chathaoirleach should be allowed to fill it. The Bill provides for a by-election to be held to fill the vacancy unless the cathaoirleach had less than 12 months to serve. Surely it would be more simple to allow the vice-chairman to fill the position.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment further on the Bill, but my time is limited. I look forward to its speedy passage through the House and hope it will result in an improved local authority system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I particularly welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate as I did not believe it would be held prior to the summer recess. However, the decision to restrict the time allocated to debate a Bill comprising 241 sections is very unsatisfactory. Many Members who wish to contribute to the debate on the Bill may not have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Oireachtas Members also serve on local authorities. Deputy Browne who spoke previously is a member of an urban council in addition to a county council. I have served as a local authority member for only two years. While I find the work exasperating and frustrating at <Col N="1102" /> times, it is also interesting and rewarding. The frustration arises from the fact that local authority members have very little power and that local authority funding is restricted, although the local government fund has resulted in welcome increases in some areas which have served to improve road quality etc. Cork County Council's allocation probably suffers as a result of the kilometre per mile provision. Cork Corporation, of which I am a member, has experienced a deficit in investment in recent years, as have other county boroughs, due to the fact that the county roads programme focused on county roads. We have raised this issue with the Minister on previous occasions and tomorrow's debate on the Estimates will provide a further opportunity to champion our cause.</P>
    <P>Judging by the feedback I received from local authority members, the payment provision is one of the most important and welcome elements of the Bill. It is certainly long overdue. The workload of local authority members has increased considerably with the introduction of SPCs and other issues and members are required to attend increasingly frequent meetings. Huge demands are placed on local authority members by members of the public, residents' associations etc. Many local authorities are dealing with waste management issues which demand considerable time and expertise. Some councillors do not have the required expertise in this area and have received very little support or information on the technical aspects of waste management. Local authority members must find time to do local authority work in addition to their own jobs. I do not know what is the proposed salary level, but at least one working day should be provided for. The payment provision is a recognition of the endless work carried out by local authority members on a voluntary basis. The vast majority of local authority members serve on local authorities because they are driven to improve the quality of life in their communities.</P>
    <P>The banning of the dual mandate will be good for local government. However, I would be wary of going down this road until structures are put in place to ensure Oireachtas Members will have some form of representation on local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is very important to ensure that and it is a point I shall make on Committee Stage. I understand objections from some Members of this House to removing the dual mandate. It is very difficult when one cannot get responses on local issues or have them attended to. That is what the public expects of politicians be they members of local authorities or of the Oireachtas. I said, despite criticism, that was why I stood in the last local government elections though I was a Member of this Dáil. At least 70% of the issues in which I was asked to become involved by constituents had to do with local issues and I am sure that is something we all find. It will be very difficult to deal with those issues unless we have some <Col N="1103" /> form of representation following the passage of this Bill.</P>

    <Title>Nice Treaty Referendum: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully respect the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty. Before I address the outcome in detail, I wish to state that the Government, the vast majority of the Members of this House and the vast majority of the Irish people are committed to Ireland's full and active membership of the European Union and to the Union's enlargement. Of those who urged a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, only a small number opposed enlargement.</P>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed by the result of the referendum. I am also disappointed that we on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side, the Government, the main political parties and the social partners, were not able to persuade a high number of voters to participate in making such an important decision. The result has also disappointed our partners and the applicant countries, whom we will meet in Gothenburg at the end of this week. Clearly the outcome poses difficulties for all involved. While it is too early to say what approach should now be taken, the Government has launched an urgent review of the factors which may have led to this result. In doing so, we will talk to other parties and organisations involved and listen very carefully. The reasons almost two-thirds of the electorate failed to vote on this occasion will be included in that review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our review needs to extend beyond the Nice treaty. The manner in which the Oireachtas monitors and evaluates ongoing EU business will form a core part of our work. It will be conducted in full consultation with our EU partners, all of whom remain committed to the ratification of the Nice treaty. Yesterday in Luxembourg our partners expressed their readiness to contribute in every possible way to helping the Government find a way forward, taking into account the concerns reflected by the referendum result. They have excluded reopening the text of the Nice treaty and this is one of the factors we have to take into account. The treaty is about enlarging and extending the European Union and giving to others a chance to develop similar to the one given to us 30 years ago. Ever since the collapse of communism, entry to the EU has been a primary objective of the countries of central and eastern Europe. They see EU membership as creating a framework to secure peace and prosperity and achieve the economic and social benefits of participation in the Union's programmes and policies. That is the view of the treaty held throughout Europe and it is a view I share. It is also a view shared by the vast majority of people here, however, many issues were raised in the campaign which were not directly relevant to the <Col N="1104" /> treaty and we on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side might have done more to address those issues.</P>
    <P>The treaty is totally in line with the Government's policy of neutrality and non-participation in military alliances. However, we are equally strongly committed to active engagement in both regional and international peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian tasks, provided they have a UN mandate. The treaty is not about a European army and there will not be a mutual defence pact. Any future participation in any given initiative involving the Rapid Reaction Force will be dependent on the safeguards we have set out. Those are, Irish support for the initiative, Dáil approval on a case by case basis and a UN mandate. While I am certain the vast majority of the Irish people remain strongly committed to the European Union and enlargement it is clear there are genuine anxieties and concerns about the future, including continuing democratic accountability in each member state, which go well beyond the terms of the treaty. We will have to reflect deeply on how those can be best addressed. In particular, people have questions about where the European Union is going in the long-term.</P>
    <P>Fundamental issues have been raised in major speeches by several of my European colleagues and it has been agreed that in 2004 there will be a further intergovernmental conference on the future of the Union. Preparations for this conference are at a very early stage. It has been agreed there should be an extensive preparatory debate across Europe involving, not just governments and parliaments but the social partners and wider civic society. This will take place over the next couple of years. I have already made it clear there will be a full debate here which will help prepare our input into the European discussions.</P>
    <P>To ensure this debate is both comprehensive and inclusive the Government has decided, in principle, at its meeting today to establish a national forum on Europe. This forum will represent the political parties and the social partners and will be broadly modelled on other fora such as the forum for peace and reconciliation and the national economic and social forum. It will be given all the necessary resources. The Government will be in touch with the main opposition parties shortly to discuss the forum's establishment and terms of reference. While it is still early days, a number of things can be said about the debate on the future of Europe. The core questions will relate to democratic legitimacy, transparency and effectiveness. How can the EU be made more meaningful to the people? How can the people better understand and control what happens in Europe? What is best done at European level and what is best done nationally? It is clear that, contrary to what some may fear, there is by no means a single vision of Europe among our partners. There are many different views about what Europe should do and how it should do it. There is no question of a uniform blueprint which will be imposed. The debate will be <Col N="1105" /> genuine and comprehensive and decisions will have to be based on consensus. The result therefore will reflect the will of each member state. We must have confidence in our ability to play a distinctive and positive part in this crucial exercise on Europe's future, rather than try to opt out because it is too complicated or we are not confident of our ability to hold our own <i>vis-à-vis</i> the larger states. It would be wrong to pre-empt the national debate. The issues which arise will be extremely complex but we have plenty of time in which to consider them fully without rushing to judgment.</P>
    <P>A number of basic starting points can be identified. There is an overriding need for the EU to continue to deliver practical benefits to people on the ground and to achieve results in its ongoing business. The emphasis in this debate must be more on the substance of what the EU should do and how it should do it, rather than on abstract institutional questions. From an Irish perspective, and from that of other smaller states, the traditional balance between the institutions has worked well and does not need radical alteration. The reality remains that, while people see themselves as Europeans, the great majority identify primarily with their own countries. The nation state remains the basic building block of the European Union and this will continue to be the case. That does not mean Ireland should take a narrow or isolationist view and I reject simplistic attempts to play on fears of the possible loss of sovereignty or independence. In March I said the true sovereignty of the people is not a theoretical concept, but a measure of how successfully we protect and promote our basic national interests and our social and economic well-being. Our consistent policy towards the EU over the past 30 years has done far more to enhance our real sovereignty than standing aside would have done. All countries, especially small ones, operate within very considerable constraints. Just as it was 30 years ago, the question is whether we would be better off co-operating and pooling resources and sovereignty with similar like-minded EU states than we would be on our own. All of the evidence, surely, is that we would be better off.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that enlargement should wait until these longer-term questions are resolved. However, it is the firm view of all member states, and of the applicants, that enlargement can and should proceed on the basis already agreed. To create an unnecessary and unjustified link between it and the future of Europe debate would delay accession to the EU for several more years. It is the consensus view among other member states and the accession candidates that the changes made in the Nice treaty are all that is required for enlargement to proceed. This was again made clear by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday. I reiterate that the Irish people want to see enlargement take place on schedule. I do not agree with any analysis that the people in voting on Thursday acted out of any selfish or narrow interest, though there is a <Col N="1106" /> danger that it might be misinterpreted as such. We know well that the Union, while it must bring practical benefits to its people, is also about a broader ideal.</P>
    <P>From day to day countries are keenly aware of their own interests as they see them and rightly so. The reality is that EU membership has been overwhelmingly and directly to our benefit. Our net receipts from the CAP have amounted to close to £20 billion. Intelligent use of the Structural Funds has helped to develop our economy and has been a substantial factor in our recent social and economic transformation. Membership of the Single European Market has been crucial in positioning Ireland as a key player in transatlantic trade and investment. Our membership of EMU has brought interest rates down to what are, in terms of recent history, remarkably low levels.</P>
    <P>While the EU has been good for Ireland in direct material ways, the Irish people have always been fully aware of its wider dimensions. I remember in 1972 a strong feeling that joining the EEC, as it was then, was a decisive step in our movement towards a more positive and outward-looking approach to the world. We realised we were opening ourselves up as a society as well as an economy and once again the balance sheet has been overwhelmingly positive in this area too.</P>
    <P>EU membership has allowed us to play a role in the wider world which would have been impossible otherwise. It has modernised our approach to issues such as gender equality and environmental protection. It has meant that Ministers and other Members of the Oireachtas, public servants, business people, trade unionists and many others have widened their horizons. Moreover, EU membership, by changing the context in which we relate to Britain and by helping us to break out of a pattern of excessive economic dependence, has greatly enhanced the British-Irish relationship. We have moved to seeing one another as partners with many shared interests and objectives. The strong relationship between the two Governments has been the bedrock on which the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement have been built and the EU has very generously supported us in building reconciliation and in stimulating North-South links.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the Irish people are fully aware of those benefits. Whatever reasons prompted them to vote against the ratification of the treaty, or to abstain, for most people our EU membership and the historic necessity for an enlarged European Union were not at issue.</P>
    <P>As I indicated last Friday, the difficulties we face will not be easy to resolve. We need to take our time to consider and consult. The Government, therefore, will not come to any hasty conclusions about the next steps. I ask all of those who favour Ireland's continued full and active participation in the European Union to adopt a similar measured approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The public comment to date on the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty has focused on the reasons for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. There were many and disparate elements in the mix which led to that vote but above all else, the referendum failed for one simple reason, namely, a failure of leadership on the part of the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach failed to organise an effective &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign. He failed to get his Government colleagues to go out and sell the Nice treaty. He failed to get the Fianna Fáil party organisation geared up. He failed to use the position of Taoiseach to make a convincing case to the public. He did not even get a majority of the electorate out to vote. It was a major failure of leadership and a major failure of management.</P>
      <P>In so far as he campaigned at all, the Taoiseach adopted the destructive, negative type of propaganda that has recently marked political campaigning in other countries. He queried the motives of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners and inaccurately cast doubts on their funding sources. He ridiculed their efforts and their commitment. I too disagree with most of the positions of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners but I respect them and acknowledge their patriotism and their love of our country. In these days of cynicism about the political process, we need to encourage people to participate in public life and in public debate. Democracy is not well served by ill-informed and condescending negative interventions.</P>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil will take at least one message from the events of last week. Negative campaigning does not work and will not work in this country. He would be well advised to ignore the recommendations coming to him from those foreign spin doctors and the best thing he could do is to get rid of them completely. Irish political issues are best dealt with by the Irish people.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland have a long and honourable tradition of democratic politics. Our electorate is more sophisticated than that in many other countries with which we have close links. We take our politics seriously. Those who abstained in last week's referendum were making a comment on the way they had been treated. Those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; were expressing a legitimate point of view. I remind the Taoiseach that when Fine Gael was in Government and had questions to put to the people, we took the issue seriously. We took the people seriously. I remind him in particular of the divorce referendum campaign and the role my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, the then Taoiseach, and I, as Fine Gael director of elections, played in putting that complex issue to the people and selling the Government's point of view to them. The most glaring failure of the Taoiseach's leadership was his failure to sell the Nice treaty to the electorate. Popularity is not much good unless one does something constructive with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another element in the Taoiseach's failure was his inability or unwillingness to mobilise his Government colleagues. In launching Fine Gael's Nice treaty campaign on 21 May last, I challenged <Col N="1108" /> the Eurosceptics in Government to play a leading role in the drive for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. I specifically singled out the Tánaiste, Deputy McCreevy and Deputy de Valera and said I wanted to see them in the forefront of the campaign. What in fact happened? Nothing.</P>
    <P>The three I named did absolutely nothing during the campaign&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not true. Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to undo the Euroscepticism which they had tried to introduce to Irish politics over the last year. On 21 May I warned that the referendum might be lost. I said that anyone who went forward thinking that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; outcome was a done deal was making a serious mistake. In particular, I said that the &ldquo;Eurosceptical Three&rdquo; would have to be active in promoting a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>I take no pleasure or satisfaction from the outcome. I take no pleasure in pointing out that I told you so but I am entitled to express my grievance that the Taoiseach did not mobilise his Ministers. I take particular exception to the Taoiseach's failure to respond to my offer to participate in an all-party public awareness campaign to ensure a positive outcome. I said in the House on 2 May that the achievement of public support for the Nice treaty was an important national objective and I offered Fine Gael support for a national &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign whether initiated by the Government or by the individual parties opposite. What happened? Nothing, not even a private response.</P>
      <P>Ireland's reputation abroad has been damaged by the failure of leadership on the part of the Taoiseach. The pointless rows of the Minister for Finance with Brussels on budgetary guidelines and on regionalisation had already created an unhelpful climate between Ireland and our partners as well as between Ireland and the Commission, for the first time since we joined in 1973. Incidentally, it would help if the Taoiseach had a quiet word with Deputy McCreevy and asked him to moderate his approach to his fellow Finance Ministers and Commission officials. He may sometimes be right but he does not need to lecture them from the lofty heights of his Kildare constituency office. A little touch of humility would go a long way to restoring the traditionally good relationship between Dublin and Brussels.</P>
      <P>In addition to creating difficulties for our fellow EU members, we have created difficulties for the eastern Europe applicant countries. I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs has recognised this by taking immediate steps to assure them that Ireland favours enlargement and will, in the weeks ahead, seek a way to deal with the difficulties that have arisen. In my meetings in Gothenburg this week with leaders of European Christian Democrat parties, I intend to reinforce the Irish message that we favour the enlargement of the EU and will support all reasonable efforts to achieve this outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> One issue which emerged as a major point of contention during the referendum campaign were the arguments about the militarisation of the EU and the erosion of our neutrality. This was hugely significant for many &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters. They accurately pointed out that a rapid reaction force with Irish participation had been established on the basis of a Council of Ministers decision. There was no mandate from this House for that decision. What became of the commitment in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto in 1997? That is the question thousands of voters were asking. They thought Fianna Fáil had, in that manifesto, promised that there would be a referendum before any commitment of Irish troops to a European force would take place. Part of the reason for last week's &ldquo;No&rdquo; outcome lies in Fianna Fáil's duplicity in seeming to promise one thing when in opposition and failing to deliver on that promise when in office.</P>
    <P>I will end on a constructive note and in doing so repeat a point I made when launching Fine Gael's &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign? Broadly speaking, Fine Gael shares the European objectives of the parties opposite. The referendum result suggests that we have a job to do to bring the electorate with us in achieving these objectives. Working together, we have a better chance than working separately. That is why I support the proposal of Deputy Quinn that a European forum should now be created along the lines of earlier forums relating to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive response from the Taoiseach today, but believe he was churlish in not acknowledging that it was Deputy Quinn who made the proposal in the first instance. I also welcome the proposal by the Taoiseach that we will have an early meeting of party leaders to agree the terms of reference and <i>modus operandi</i> of such a forum. Such a forum would provide a way of assessing the nature of our concerns about European developments and would seek to find a way to reconcile differences and move forward in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of things need to be said in the aftermath of this referendum result. The first is fundamental. The people have spoken and their decision must be respected. European leaders are wrong to state that enlargement of the European Union can go ahead as set out in the Nice treaty. That is only possible, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last night, if the Nice treaty is ratified. Otherwise enlargement issues will have to be dealt with at the next Intergovernmental Conference. That is not to say, as some of those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side have done, that other European countries should halt their ratification process and that our Government should insist that they do. We are entitled to ask them to recognise our decision, but we should respect their democratic and constitutional requirements also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued that there was no need to hold this referendum this month or, as it was originally <Col N="1110" /> intended, in May. I did so because I believed more time was needed for an internal debate within this country and because I knew the treaty's timetable did not demand that the process of ratification be concluded until the end of 2002. The Nice treaty cannot be deemed to be passed or to have fallen until that date passes. Other countries are entitled to proceed in the meantime.</P>
    <P>This obviously raises the possibility of a further referendum here on the Nice treaty. The people are sovereign and are entitled to review and reverse any decision they have taken. I find it strange that people who have campaigned for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on the basis of the people's sovereignty seem to have philosophical difficulties with such a position. As opponents of European integration or even Irish membership of the Union, they have been in a position to revisit these issues at each successive referendum. I fail to see why people who support &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on this occasion should not be similarly entitled to fight again another day.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise in respect of any prospective question to be put to the people. It would be unacceptable to go back to the people with the same proposition that was rejected last Thursday. Other member states and the applicant countries regard the Nice treaty to be necessary to facilitate enlargement. Given that enlargement is not contested by most, but not all, of those who campaigned against the treaty, if other concerns can be addressed, then surely it will be possible to refer back to the people again. While successive radio broadcasts have indicated myriad reasons the Irish people opposed this treaty from the state of the health services to the botched flotation of Eircom, issues of accountability and neutrality stand out.</P>
    <P>In our policy paper on the Nice treaty my party drew attention to some of these issues. We suggested that we and not our European colleagues, are at fault for a part of the alienation felt from the European project. To address this issue my party will publish a European Union Bill to greatly increase the accountability of our Ministers to the Houses of the Oireachtas and by extension to the electorate. I cite, as an example, the procedure discussed earlier today in relation to a decision taken by a Minister of State to postpone a new right being conferred on European workers for a period of up to four years. While my party believes that no change of domestic law is required to deal with Ireland's participation in the Rapid Reaction Force, contingent on a UN mandate, it is clear now that further certainty is required in this regard and should be provided in law.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless I remain committed to such a force. It is ironic that those who campaigned against this treaty on an anti-NATO basis seem to be satisfied to leave peace-keeping activity on our continent to NATO. I would have thought any movement away from this reality, such as the Rapid Reaction Force imperfectly represents, <Col N="1111" /> would be regarded as an improvement, particularly when that force is in some way accountable to democratically elected European institutions. I believe that is the case. As it is, Irish soldiers have participated in SFOR in Bosnia under NATO leadership and with a UN mandate. The world is not as simple a place as some pretend. The boundaries are sometimes not as clear as we would like them to be.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether action on these two fronts would be sufficient to persuade the people to change their minds in a further referendum on this treaty. However, action on both fronts should be taken because, as we have pointed out, it is necessary in itself. Our proposal for a forum on the future of Europe, to be run along the lines of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, is now an urgent necessity.</P>
    <P>I welcome what appears to be growing support for that concept within Government, and I acknowledge that the Government has on a number of occasions acknowledged the proposal and has now generously embraced it. That is a sound message from the House. Had the Taoiseach and the Government embraced that proposal wholeheartedly and vigorously before last Thursday, we might have reversed the result, but perhaps not. Nevertheless, progress has been made and I will respond to the Taoiseach's invitation to consult on the structure and composition of the suggested group, and the personality of the person who will take on the task of chairing it independently. It should be structured in a similar manner to the two other fora &ndash; the New Ireland Forum and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>It is too early to make a call on what should happen from here. In that, I share the view of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, I am concerned about some of the noises coming from the rest of Europe which I fear could undermine the sense of democratic legitimacy of the Union project. Nonetheless, it would be churlish of us not to understand the dilemma we and the other member states now have to face together. They have to talk and deal with the disappointment and instability generated in the applicant states. I understand too the reluctance to open up the Nice treaty for full or even partial re-negotiation, a position confirmed in Luxembourg this week. A right like this accorded to one country would have to be afforded to all. Total uncertainty and instability would ensue. It would be difficult to persuade any country to ratify treaties in the future if the hope of constant re-negotiation is held out.</P>
    <P>All sides to this referendum debate have been at pains to state their support for enlargement. No doubt there are some people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; that are opposed to enlargement but my fundamental instinct is that they represent a small minority of the electorate. The reality is that as a result of our decision, the enlargement process has been fundamentally derailed and that poses consider<Col N="1112" /> able difficulties for all applicant countries as well as the member states. It is simply not true, as some &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners have suggested, that the existing treaties contain sufficient powers to deal with the scale of enlargement that the Treaty of Nice would have facilitated.</P>
    <P>An eminent law lecturer, in an article published in recent days, talked about using the existing treaty provisions to provide for enlargement as we experienced it and as did the most recent applicants for enlargement from 12 to 15. Technically she was correct, but the political reality is that all of the existing 15 member states have said such enlargement cannot continue as it has until now. Building an extension to the extension of an extension is no longer possible. Notwithstanding the legal interpretations of that position, which from an academic point of view cannot be challenged, all of the existing member states said initially in Amsterdam, and confirmed after painstaking negotiations in Nice, that certain complex changes had to be made. Those changes concerned the composition of the commission, the qualified majority voting and its extension to 30 new areas, capping the size of the European Parliament and adjusting the membership accordingly. All of those things did not come about easily as anyone party to European Union negotiations knows, or anyone whose political party is associated with other European parties already knows. It is inconceivable to think that those hard fought for and painfully extracted compromises can somehow be reversed. That will not happen. Therefore we have to realise that whether people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side like it or not, the groundwork in terms of enlargement, as set out in the Treaty of Nice, is the only groundwork on which enlargement will take place. Some reality, as far as this House is concerned, will have to prevail.</P>
    <P>If it is the case, and I concede that it may well be, that it is not possible for this State to ratify the treaty we will, at least, have put back the time table for enlargement. The honest thing to do at this stage for us all is to accept that this is the case, regardless of the consequences for our reputation and standing in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>If there is a democratic deficit within the European Union this country has a representational deficit among the applicant states. It is time to dust off the proposals for residential embassies in those applicant countries, particularly those most likely to join the EU in the short-term. The programme for representational expansion must be brought forward within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Other than the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Ireland has the smallest diplomatic representation of all EU member states in applicant countries. It is inconceivable that we can repair some of the damage done to our reputation in countries like Estonia or Slovenia if we do not proceed to open up residential embassies. The costs, relative to the Taoiseach's aspirations to spend money on other areas, are small. The commencement costs are no more that £600,000 to <Col N="1113" /> £700,000 and operational costs are about £500,000 per annum for a three-person embassy including a representative from Enterprise Ireland. If ever there was a compelling argument to move quickly on that, the argument has taken on a new sense of urgency because of the damage done to the perception of Ireland as being an &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo;. We have become something different in the eyes of those people. I urge the Taoiseach to review the plans which no doubt already exist for this to be advanced.</P>
    <P>The people have sent a message to us in this House about how we conduct our business. It is one the Taoiseach should heed. Since I became leader of my party I have sought to make one important point in respect of this country's relationship with the European Union. Namely that it was entering a new and fundamentally different era from the one that has existed in the past. From its first day in office and the embarrassing failure to appoint a Minister with specific responsibility for European affairs, the Government has ducked that issue. Those of us who support the European project are the most frustrated as a result. I have placed in the public domain a record of my private correspondence with the Taoiseach in respect of the timing of this referendum. That he chose to ignore my advice is something I regret. My fears have proven to be correct.</P>
    <P>It is important that we learn lessons from this. A single lengthy speech to the Institute of European Affairs does not constitute the initiation of a debate on an Intergovernmental Conference. Nor does a published speech at the Irish Council of the European movement. More could have been done in a systematic and structured way. Despite repeated requests it was not done. Leadership is about more than the endless pursuit of photo opportunities. Similarly being a member of the Government means more than just supporting that Government's policy when it suits. Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív please copy. If one does not like or cannot support Government policy, then one must get out. It does politics no favour to see junior ministers like Deputy Ó Cuív make hypocrites of themselves. He should take no comfort from the fact that the Taoiseach does not have the authority to stand up to him. Taken in conjunction with the Local Government Bill, I think we can expect an increasing number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers departing from script over the next few months.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the Government has to exercise moral leadership to convince the public of its case. The problem with this Government, whether Deputy Harney likes it or not, is that it has spent its time in office undermining and disparaging the case for Europe. We know what Deputy Harney has said and has been reported as saying in public, heaven knows what she has said to people in private. It is little wonder that the people have copped on. The contrast between how this Taoiseach sought to sell this treaty with the lead shown by his predecessor in the divorce <Col N="1114" /> referendum is considerable as Deputy Noonan has already indicated. In the latter days of that campaign, Mervyn Taylor and others indicated to Deputy Bruton that given his authority as the leader of a party that is a member of the Christian Democratic family in Europe, he had to go on radio and appeal to part of the constituency of this Republic that had reservations about divorce. He did so and many people credit him with turning the extra few votes into what was the narrowest majority in favour of any referendum in this country. That required courage, sadly there was none of that from the current Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I intend to share my time with Deputies Higgins<i> (Dublin West) </i>and Ó Caoláin. The decision of the people to reject the Treaty of Nice was an historic one. I am proud of the role played by the Green Party in that decision. The people have spoken, but are the politicians listening, particularly those in the establishment? </P>
      <P>I do not see any signs of humility and it appears that no lessons have been learned. We have been informed that the Government and the establishment parties will interpret what the people have said. What appears to have been said is &ldquo;We respect your decision, but now you will have to change it&rdquo;. That is not respect, it is contempt. We saw an exhibition of that contempt yesterday in Luxembourg when we were informed by the Council of Ministers that we could like it or lump it. The Government campaign was characterised by a great deal of huffing and puffing, bluster and bluff, smear, innuendo, the politics of the gutter and, above all else, condescension and total arrogance. We dealt with the facts; we wanted a calm, rational debate. Unfortunately, it was not forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Referendum Commission. Not a single previous speaker has had the courtesy to congratulate the commission on its role. <Col N="1115" /> The Referendum Commission was established by the Oireachtas &ndash; I voted with the Government in favour of its being set up &ndash; but no one has congratulated it on the role it played. The commission did an exceptional job under extremely difficult conditions and it was hamstrung in its efforts by the Government. I spoke to the staff of the commission and I am aware that they were in total chaos because they were not allowed to do their jobs. Let us learn lessons from that. The Referendum Commission must be allowed to do its job on the next occasion. It is clear there will be a further referendum and I want the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to admit that. They are shaping up to hold another referendum but they do not have the guts to say so.</P>
    <P>We dealt with the facts in our campaign. The first was that the Attorney General stated that the referendum had to be held because of the enhanced co-operation procedures, which, clearly, would lead to the creation of a two-tier Europe. Under the Amsterdam Treaty, we had a veto on enhanced co-operation. However, that has been removed. Eight countries will now be able to proceed with enhanced co-operation projects under the procedures provided at Nice. We made it clear that this was not the type of Europe we desired.</P>
    <P>The second fact was that we stated that the treaty was not concerned with enlargement but that it was about further integration and deepening. The people believed us. Deputy Quinn quoted Professor Conlan of the University of Limerick who confirmed our assertion that enlargement can continue. Günther Verheugen, the Commissioner for Enlargement, also stated that enlargement could continue. He has changed his tune, however, and has stated that he is not so sure about the position. It is clear there is confusion among European Commissioners at this stage, but the people believed the view we expressed. That view is valid and it has been confirmed by legal analysts.</P>
    <P>We have informed our European colleagues that we favour enlargement. I know the Taoiseach has taken this fact on board, but I want the message to go out from this Chamber. Last weekend we met our colleagues from Poland and the Czech Republic in the Hague with the European Federation of Green Parties. They clearly understood our position and issued a statement to the effect that we must step back and reconsider the treaty. I appreciate that the Taoiseach is in a difficult position, but what would be the outcome if this treaty was put to the people of France or Germany? It would be defeated and the Taoiseach knows that.</P>
    <P>What sort of Europe are we creating? It is a Europe with a democratic deficit where people do not matter, a Europe for the élite and for bureaucrats. We want a different type of Europe. If the proposed European forum can help create our vision of Europe, count us in. We will put <Col N="1116" /> forward our views in the same forceful manner in which we set them down during the referendum campaign. We won the head-to-head debates which took place during the campaign and that is why the people chose to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We will win again unless there is a clear re-negotiation of the treaty. However, there will be no re-negotiation. The matter will simply be put before the people again.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the question of militarisation. Deputy Quinn put it to me that if we do not have a European Rapid Reaction Force, we will be faced with the involvement of NATO. However, I believe we demonstrated that there is a correlation between ESDP &ndash; European Security and Defence Policy &ndash; and ESDI &ndash; European Security and Defence Identity &ndash; as put forward by NATO. That is clearly spelt out in the annexes of the treaty. Those involved in the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign failed to convince people on this score. How could they do so because in this Chamber in 1996 the Taoiseach stated that the Western European Union is the European wing of NATO. It is obvious the Taoiseach made these comments when in Opposition and promptly forgot about them. However, we recalled them and we threw them back in his face. In this treaty, the Western European Union is being fully incorporated into the European Union. We will, therefore, be faced with militarisation.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that some form of declaration will be made to convince people that everything is all right. If the Treaty of Nice has nothing to do with militarisation, why is it necessary to draw up a declaration? During the next referendum campaign, the Taoiseach will be obliged to explain to the people why he is contradicting himself.</P>
    <P>We must be careful about protecting the vision of Europe. This has been outlined by Joschka Fischer, of the German Green Party, and Gerhard Schröder. Mr. Schröder has stated that the Council of Ministers should become a second Chamber. Let us consider the sort of second Chamber with which we will be faced in a federal Europe.</P>

      <P>My final point is that, at present, Ireland has three votes out of 87. In an enlarged Europe, we will have seven votes out of 237. It is clear there will be a shift, because the votes of larger states will be trebled. Contrast this to the United States where each state, regardless of its size, is entitled to equal representation in the Senate. We do not have that in Europe, we do not have equality. I want a Europe of justice and equality.</P>

      <P>I commend the electorate who rejected the Nice treaty on 7 June. This <Col N="1117" /> was a tremendous victory for Irish democracy, sovereignty and independent foreign policy. I also commend those who campaigned for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote against the odds. We did so despite attempted moral blackmail, misinformation and arrogance on the part of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign. The people's approval for this treaty was taken for granted and they were treated as a rubber stamp. However, it was our stance which was vindicated by the electorate in the rejection of the Nice treaty. It is farcical for Fine Gael and the Labour Party to seize on the loss of the referendum by the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign as a stick with which to beat the Government. They all stood together in support of the Nice treaty, despite the scathing criticism of it by the Fine Gael and Labour leaders when it was negotiated last December. They have all now been given their answer by the people.</P>
      <P>The Nice treaty is now legally dead, particularly as it must be ratified by all members states. This State has refused to ratify the treaty in the most democratic fashion, that is, by the vote of the people. It is an outrage to suggest that the same treaty can be put before the people again in the hope that this time they will make what some would describe as the &ldquo;right decision&rdquo;. This point of view is clearly held by those who do not like the decision made on 7 June.</P>
      <P>There is a growing sense of anger and disbelief among people that their will as expressed on 7 June is being flagrantly violated by the Government and its EU counterparts. The statement of the EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg is a disgrace. The Ministers claimed in one breath to respect the will of the Irish people and then excluded &ldquo;any re-opening of the text signed in Nice&rdquo; and proceeded to state that &ldquo;the ratification process will continue on the basis of this text and in accordance with the agreed timetable&rdquo;. In agreeing to such a statement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, clearly defied the decision of the electorate. The people were asked to accept or reject an amendment to the Constitution to ratify the Treaty of Nice and they said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. There have also been statements by the Swedish Presidency and the French President, Jacques Chirac, that the Nice treaty must be ratified. President Chirac described the Irish referendum result as a difficulty which would have to be overcome. EU Commission President, Romano Prodi, says he &ldquo;does not know and does not care&rdquo; if the Commission's attempt to dictate the contents of the Irish budget had any influence on the referendum outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrogant pledges to proceed with the Nice treaty, regardless of the fact that the result of the Irish referendum was a refusal to ratify it, confirms everything we in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign have said about the anti-democratic nature of the drive to an EU super state There is no doubt that the defence of Irish neutrality and independent foreign policy was one of the key issues for people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. They remembered the broken promise to hold a referendum on NATO's Partnership for Peace and, therefore, <Col N="1118" /> did not trust the Government's promises on neutrality and the Nice treaty. The Government should withdraw from both the Rapid Reaction Force and NATO's PfP.</P>
    <P>The EU enlargement process can proceed. This time we can have an arrangement which, unlike the Nice treaty, is really about enlargement and not a device to empower further the larger states and the EU bureaucracy at the expense of sovereign democracies. We cannot and should not proceed with the further integration and centralisation of the EU and the creation of a two-tier system as provided for in the now rejected Treaty of Nice. We must take time for a real debate on the future of the EU and I welcome the announcement of a forum on Europe. It should be an all-Ireland one.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the promise of the Taoiseach of consultation with the main Opposition parties on its terms of reference. The main Opposition parties in the House on this issue are my party, Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Socialist Party. In that debate, Sinn Féin advocates an EU of the people and not of the bureaucrats and the arrogant political élite who were rejected by the electorate last week.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> So far in these statements the contributions of the Taoiseach and the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party have amounted to a phoney squabble among the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; family on who should take the blame for the cow kicking over the bucket of Nice milk. We need a genuine debate on the issue. The rejection of the Nice treaty was a stunning rebuff not only for the Government parties but for all the political establishment, including Fine Gael and Labour, the church establishment and the business and trade union establishments. It was a rejection not only of the Nice treaty but of the cynical manoeuvre of the Government to railroad it through with a few weeks' debate.</P>
      <P>It was also a rejection of the betrayal by the Government in failing to hold a referendum on the Partnership for Peace which was previously promised by Fianna Fáil. A majority did not believe the Government and the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign on a number of key issues. They did not believe the Nice treaty was unrelated to a policy to create a military wing for the EU, and they were right. The treaty consolidated the move to create an economic superbloc to rival the United States and with a military wing to give it more weight in world politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nice treaty and what preceded it is an endorsement of the reprehensible armaments industry within the EU. This is the ugly face of the EU kept hidden successfully, but which has annual sales of £50 billion and profits of more than £10 billion from manufacturing and selling weapons of mass destruction throughout the world. It has bribed and corrupted senior politicians in the EU and, under the guise of humanitarianism, has persuaded EU Governments to continue to spend massive extra sums of money. <Col N="1119" /> There was no reference to the people on the creation of the Rapid Reaction Force which is an EU army in the making.</P>
    <P>The Nice treaty was also designed to consolidate the already massive clout wielded by multinational corporations. The European Round Table and other business organisations have had their agendas foisted on the people of Europe, especially the privatisation agenda, to which the Government has taken with a vengeance. The privatisation drive has been driven by the EU, and the European multinationals are already busily buying public services in eastern Europe. Their agenda is not to lift the poor and small farming people but to soak them for more profits.</P>
    <P>There are horrific economic, social and environmental problems in some east European countries with decades of Stalinist misrule being followed by multinational economic dictatorship. That is not the way forward. No answer was given to me in the campaign when I asked what was the future of the millions of small farmers in Poland and Romania. They will be wiped out by the agri-businesses of existing EU member states.</P>
    <P>Let the political establishment be warned. A cynical move to use some type of neutrality protocol as a fig leaf to cover the unacceptability of the Nice treaty will not be tolerated. That will not succeed in a second referendum. The Socialist Party did not oppose the Nice treaty as a Nationalist party but as an internationalist one. Genuine internationalism embraces all the working people and the small farming communities of Europe, east and west, but rejects a Europe dominated and dictated to by multinationals and the armaments industry.</P>
    <P>The Europe I want to see is a genuine community of peoples and a confederation of European democratic and socialist states where the resources and wealth are run in the interests of ordinary people and where the safeguarding of the environment and eco-systems are paramount. It is not a Europe provided by the Nice treaty. It is the only way the poor, small farming and working people of eastern Europe will be lifted from the poverty and problems they endure.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday, a European electorate spoke on the Nice treaty. That is a fundamental fact which must inform our considerations and actions at national and European levels. Although many people regrettably chose not to vote, it was a democratic result and we must respect it as such. We must listen to the views of the electorate and take time to address its concerns. We must not pretend or assume the electorate did not know or understand what it was doing in voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;. There were many reasons a majority voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; as there were many reasons people voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and others abstained. Even if we disagree on the reasons for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and with the result and even if we <Col N="1120" /> are disappointed, as I am, we must bow to the primacy of the electorate in a referendum.</P>
      <P>There are other facts which will be central to our considerations and actions going forward as a Government and Oireachtas. The fact remains that Ireland's national interest lies in playing a constructive and positive role in Europe and the wider world. This applies across the board diplomatically, economically, culturally and socially. Our recent economic prosperity can only be sustained by being open, competitive and adaptable. Hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland owe their livelihoods to this policy and to their positive attitude to working in the wider world. The people are not narrow, nationalist, self-centred and isolationist.</P>
      <P>What has confused international observers is that many of the party political groupings opposed to the Nice treaty can be accurately described as narrow, nationalist, self-centred and isolationist. I am and will continue to be critical of the policy platforms of these political groups which range from the destructive to the naive.</P>

      <P>The process of ratification of the Nice treaty continues in other EU member states. Each country is entitled to organise its ratification process in its own way and to proceed at its own pace. We would not like to be criticised by other member states for our requirement to hold a referendum on treaty changes. Similarly, it is not for us to tell other member states how or when to ratify the treaty.</P>
      <P>It is also a fact that the deadline for the Nice treaty to come into effect is the end of 2002 with the requirement that it would be ratified by all member states by then. This means we have considerable time for debate on the issues relevant to the Nice treaty in addition to the wider issues of the future direction and structure of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to set up a special forum in which all these issues can be debated and teased out is the right way forward. Only with such a long period of debate and reflection will we reach a resolution of how we want to proceed in Europe and how we wish to play our part in enlargement. Only with an inclusive debate close to the people and without the jargon will we reach a clear view on how we want to proceed in meeting our own requirements and the legitimate expectations of fellow EU member states and applicant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> It is also a fact that people have genuine concerns about the most important European issues. These wider issues are about democratic accountability, national and European decision-making, national social norms, neutrality and the use of military force. I and my party understand these concerns and do not dismiss them. Some of them go to the heart of how we organise our democracy at national and international level. We must debate them fully, openly and honestly and with the people and not merely among ourselves in politics and administration.</P>
    <P>The people want to see robust debate on all these issues. They want the European Union to have the right policies as well as the right decision making structures. They want to see normal politics on European and national issues. That means the contest of political ideas and policies. The people do not want to see debate closed down and policy discussions carried on behind closed doors, either in Brussels or in Dublin. They do not want the word &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; to be used &ndash; or rather abused &ndash; in an attempt to close down real debate on issues of concern to them, free citizens of Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>That is why I express my views openly and honestly on European, Irish and international issues. A debate has already started among European political leaders on these questions. They speak frankly and frequently and so will I and my party. Since last Thursday the Opposition has indulged in a blame game. I have been charged, for instance, with causing a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote because of a speech I made last year and because I expressed what I saw as the national interest last February in relation to budgetary policy. I would do exactly the same again. I do not believe in stifling debate, as the clear implication of the Opposition's position would be. The people do not want their political leaders to become programmed robots when it comes to European issues. The issues are too important for that. I expressed my views clearly and honestly for the Nice treaty and enlargement but against a European super state; for Euro-realism and against Euro-scepticism; for enterprise and job creation but against State barriers to jobs and employment, whether those barriers are Irish or European, private or public.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Labour Party would do better to stop harping on about a speech I gave last year, although I am flattered by his obsession with it. I am flattered also that he should imply that my remarks would have turned around his former political adviser, Fergus Finlay, a former Labour Attorney General, John Rogers, Mick O'Reilly of the ATGWU and many others.</P>

      <P>He would do better to ask whether the people agree that the destiny of Ireland is as one region in a big Europe, like Walloon region of Belgium, as he said himself a few years ago. The Irish people would not swap the sovereign <Col N="1122" /> republic of Ireland for a small European region named Ireland, as Deputy Quinn suggested some time ago. This idea, I am sure, contributes more to Irish concerns about the future direction of Europe than anything members of the Government may have said.</P>
      <P>In recent speeches the president of the Labour Party asks us to believe his party is the real European party in Ireland. This is, he would say, on the basis that the European Union is necessarily socialist and a place where the Labour Party's policies are safe, always implemented and essential to the very project. This sort of political vanity is another turn off for voters and it is so wrong. The European Parliament, the European Commission and the member state Governments are made up of many more parties and policies than Labour and the European Socialists. There is a contest of political ideas in Europe but the more the Labour Party puts out the idea that in the EU there is one set of policies the more people will see this as undemocratic.</P>
      <P>As for Deputy Noonan's speech, we need take no lectures from a party which saw fit to spend £100,000 on a Celtic snail billboard earlier this year when important issues such as the Nice treaty received a truly sluggish response from his new leadership. Unique among parties on the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side, Fine Gael chose the launch of its Nice treaty campaign to attack other political parties. It was negative from the start. I cannot help thinking the party's Nice treaty campaign would have been quite different if previous leaders of his party had been in charge.</P>
      <P>The divorce referendum was carried on the last occasion, unlike the first occasion it was put to the people when it was roundly defeated. On that occasion Dr. Garrett FitzGerald was Taoiseach and it was not a lack of effort on his part which caused it to be defeated. The then main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, decided to change its approach and support the change in the Constitution. As any objective observer would agree, that change made a crucial difference because the proposal was carried by 1% of the electorate.</P>
      <P>Ireland's future is as a fully engaged, active participant in a dynamic and expanded Europe. This will need appropriate democratic decision making at national and European level, allocated in ways that have the confidence of the population. We need the right policies for a dynamic, job creating Europe as well as the right structures for decision-making. We need to play our part to secure peace and prosperity on the entire European continent through enlargement. The challenge before us is to work out, together with the people, how we want to do this in the coming years, and particularly how we will co-operate with our partners and the applicant countries to make it possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 50 or 60 years the applicant countries have lived under Communist regimes. It is only in the recent years that democracy has been bedded down in many of these countries. They suffered enormous internal and external <Col N="1123" /> oppression during those years. They deserve the opportunity to participate in the EU with the other 15 member states so that democracy can be supported and peace and stability maintained. They also deserve the opportunity to grow their economies, just as the Irish economy has grown so successfully in the 28 years since we become a member of the EU.</P>
    <P>After a prolonged and reasoned debate we will be ready to take further decisions to achieve our shared goals in Europe. My party and I will play a full and energetic role in this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to join in what amounts to a post mortem on the failure of the Government to convince the electorate to support the Nice treaty. It is important that the Government contributions be honest and realistic. The point made by Deputy Noonan is clear. The failure to secure support for the treaty amounted to a failure of leadership on the part of the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach did not discharge his responsibility and the country, not the Government or the Fianna Fáil Party, suffers as a consequence. My country has been severely damaged as a result of that failure of leadership.</P>
      <P>Why did the electorate fail to turn out to vote &ndash; the main reason the referendum was lost? There was complacency on the part of the Government, amounting to gross negligence. The Government took the electorate for granted. It took the easy way out of rolling speeches off word processors and photocopiers and assumed that type of media campaign would be sufficient to engage and energise the electorate and persuade voters to turn out. This obviously would not work and it did not.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the suggestion of a politically more sinister motive for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign may have some substance. Was there an unwillingness on the part of the Government parties to confront the &ldquo;No&rdquo; lobby for fear of alienating votes in the upcoming general election? That suggestion has been made. The Government owes an explanation to the country as to why it did not engage in a campaign of any consequence to persuade the electorate to vote and support the treaty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste has attempted to justify her Boston rather than her Berlin approach. It was not Mary Harney who made that speech but the Tánaiste of this country and, therefore, it has an impact. It is important to bear in mind that statements of that sort, including one in the <i>Financial Times, </i>encourages Euro-scepticism. The Tánaiste's statement was supported by the speech <Col N="1124" /> of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera and by the cavalier attitude to Europe of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The conduct of the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, was of a kind with that approach. The only difference was that his approach was entirely dishonest. While in Dublin he supported the treaty, he made a pre-emptive strike in the west on TG4, presumably designed to compete with Dana in his Galway West constituency for the &ldquo;more Catholic than the bishops&rdquo; fundamentalist vote in the next general election. That is cynicism and dishonesty at their worst but it is a matter for Deputy Ó Cuív to confront.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the Taoiseach's further appalling lack of leadership in dealing with this type of dishonest politics. It seems to be quite normal for the Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil Ministers to speak out of both sides of their mouths. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, was merely following in the ignoble footsteps of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who was also happy to travel on both sides of the road when it came to taxi deregulation. In Dublin, Deputy O'Dea was prepared to support the party position, yet in his constituency he took exactly the opposite point of view.</P>
    <P>The relevant issue is not the gombeen approach of these Ministers of State but rather that the Taoiseach seems content to approve of it. Even more interesting is that the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, also seems prepared to endorse that approach. It would not be so important if such grave issues were not at stake. It is clear that Ireland's failure to ratify the Treaty of Nice has severely damaged the name of our country abroad. This is obvious not only from the reaction of the existing member states of the European Union but particularly when one gauges the reaction of the applicant countries whose route to EU membership has been blocked.</P>
    <P>I accept that accession negotiations can proceed but they cannot be completed until the Treaty of Nice has been ratified. I am not surprised that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, found it necessary to engage in a series of <i>mea culpa</i> meetings with representatives of the applicant countries in Luxembourg. That is only a start. Serious damage has been caused and those responsible for it have done a grave disservice to the country.</P>
    <P>Every conceivable mistake was made in the run up to the referendum. No explanation has been given as to why the issue was rushed. Fine Gael supported the Treaty of Nice but asked that the referendum be deferred to the autumn to allow for a proper information campaign beforehand. A mix and match approach was taken, combining it with other referenda, including an attempt to throw in one concerning judicial conduct. That was not the way to proceed on an issue of such grave importance. Above all, there was no campaign on the ground by the Government. I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, led <Col N="1125" /> a campaign through the media, although he did not get much support from many of his ministerial colleagues.</P>
    <P>I categorically reject the suggestion that there was no &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign. The Fine Gael party ran such a campaign in every constituency and I was the party's director of elections. There were cynical sneers from some of the media sheep as to the type of postering that was used but, as Oscar Wilde said, there is only one thing worse than being criticised and that is being ignored. At least they knew there were posters featuring the endorsement of the Treaty of Nice by Fine Gael's public representatives. They were the only &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; posters in most of the constituencies. They were supplemented by more than half a million canvass cards and leaflets which we attempted to bring to as many houses as possible, explaining in detail why we supported the treaty. Nothing similar was done by any other party endorsing the Treaty of Nice and, as a consequence, we are now paying for it.</P>
    <P>What should be done now? We have to examine what went wrong and look beyond the Treaty of Nice. If one examines European referenda over the past ten years, one can see that no major information campaigns were associated with any of them. Why? Going back to Maastricht, the main issue was whether we would receive £6 billion or £8 billion as a consequence of that treaty. There was a dispute over the amount of money involved but no serious debate on European issues. When it came to the Amsterdam Treaty, less money was involved but there was a major focus on the financial implications arising from that treaty. In addition, it was associated with the Good Friday referendum on the same day.</P>
    <P>When it came to the Treaty of Nice there was no money and no campaign on the part of the Government. That was the essential difference and why it was lost. As regards any future European referendum, we will have to ensure a more serious sustained information campaign in the lead up to the introduction of legislation in the House, following the passage of such legislation and in the lead up to the referendum date. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution considered these issues and its draft report has been made available to the Government, although it has not been published. In the report we made serious proposals for time limits to ensure proper information campaigns both from the point of view of the Oireachtas debate, 90 days, and, thereafter, a further 90 days in the run up to the referendum date. That would allow adequate time to confront what, in the case of the Nice treaty, was wilful misinformation on the part of some, although I am not accusing all.</P>

      <P>That appalling vista should be considered. There is no procedure for leaving the European Union or being thrown out of it but there is a precedent. Greenland left, as a region of Denmark, in 1976. As part of our debate on this matter, however, we should consider that appalling vista. How would we stand &ndash; and where would American and other foreign investment go &ndash; if we found ourselves isolated from the other EU members states? If the other 14 member states want to ensure enlargement by admitting 12 applicant countries, 26 versus one might mean that we would be in a very difficult situation. That is one of the issues that has to be examined.</P>
      <P>I make a number of suggestions. First, the Government should appoint a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. I do not mean any criticism of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, by this but such an appointment would help, given his responsibilities in Northern Ireland and on the UN Security Council. I was, <i>de facto</i>, a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs because the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Peter Barry, was so engaged in Northern Ireland. My experience was that it was an advantage for the country to have a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs who was able to co-ordinate what was happening in Europe on behalf of the country.</P>
      <P>Second, I am delighted the Labour Party's proposal for a forum for Europe has been accepted; it will help to promote a rational debate based on more information.</P>
      <P>Third, the proposal of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on reform of the Seanad should be considered from the point of view of using the Upper House as a bridgehead for Europe by allowing MEPs and EU Commissioners to attend sittings. Above all, such reform would ensure that debates on EU directives and other regulations took place in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Fourth, there is a strong case for resourcing more adequately the Joint Committee on European Affairs. It is clear that a major effort has been made by my colleague, Deputy Durkan, as chairman of that committee, but he has been struggling valiantly without resources of any consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Fifth, consideration must be given to the way referenda are run. I referred to the provision of adequate time, but funding must also be examined. There is a proposal in the draft report regarding the provision of funding for Members in order that they can explain to their constituents the position they are taking in regard to a referendum proposal.</P>
    <P>Sixth, the ballot paper should be examined. I was told there was a great deal of confusion regarding the way in which the ballot paper was framed. If so, let us see if we can at least provide a ballot paper that people can fully understand.</P>
    <P>Finally, if there is a further referendum, there should be a proper Government campaign. Without such a campaign, there is no hope of success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I returned from Luxembourg this afternoon having attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers yesterday and having met individually 11 Ministers of the accession countries this morning. The other Minister was not available.</P>
      <P>Our EU colleagues unanimously expressed concern and disappointment at the outcome of the referendum on the Treaty of Nice and I share their disappointment. I explained that the decision to hold a referendum was based on legal advice provided for the Government and informed my colleagues on the General Affairs Council that the campaign against the treaty was composed of a variety of disparate elements. Matters raised by them included issues not germane to the treaty. There were also interpretations given to aspects of it for which there is no treaty reference. There were, therefore, myriad reasons given as to why the voters may have decided to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I also adverted to the historically low turnout and the unfortunate confusion among sections of the electorate about what the treaty did and did not contain. Our EU partners accepted my assurances that the vote was in no way a vote against enlargement. They also pledged to give whatever assistance was possible in helping Ireland to find a way forward taking into account the concerns reflected by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time the reality, as reflected in the Council conclusions adopted yesterday, is that none of our EU partners is willing to renegotiate the text of the treaty. The treaty took the best part of one year to complete, including four days at Heads of Government level at Nice last December. All member states and candidate countries remain committed to the treaty as being the basis for enlargement. This is an important reiteration of the legal and political position as far as the 15 member states and the candidate countries are concerned. There is no method by which enlargement can be triggered other than ratification by all 15 member states. In respecting our position as a result of the referendum last Thursday, it is clear we have also to respect the <Col N="1128" /> Council's firm position which it reiterated yesterday.</P>
    <P>Those who have suggested the Government can somehow call a halt to this process are fundamentally out of touch with the situation as it stands. Each member state is fully entitled to pursue national ratification in line with its own democratic procedures and principles. To suggest otherwise is contrary to their democratic rights as member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of legal fact, it is, therefore, impossible for any member state to veto the ratification process in other member states. Such a suggestion, made yesterday evening by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; lobby is, therefore, ludicrous and based on an ignorance of the legal procedures.</P>
      <P>There is, however, another reality. Many have real concerns about the treaty or, in some cases, what they believe it contains. It is the job of Government to listen to these concerns and answer them as best it can. The Government will in the coming period attempt to find solutions to the identifiable reasons behind the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and reflect on the substantial number of voters who opposed the treaty in good faith and because of sincerely held convictions. There are people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they have a view that the EU is perceived as not being adequately accountable to them and their interests. We must try to address their concerns in a satisfactory way.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the Nice Treaty sets out a mechanism for a thorough debate on the future of the Union: what we want from it, where we want it to go and, importantly, what we think is best left to national governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

We should promote the broadest public involvement and a greater understanding of the European Union's working methods is one of the key goals of this process.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Taoiseach informed the House that the Government intends shortly to convene a forum on Europe to discuss these issues. At the Institute of European Affairs I replied to Deputy Gormley's colleague, Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, who is a keen advocate of the ratification of the Treaty of Nice and made it clear it was a constructive proposal which we should examine carefully. I am glad the Government has come forward with this decision at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that open public debate and consequent understanding of what the <Col N="1129" /> European Union does and how it operates will dispel many of the fears which led people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in last week's referendum. I was able to reassure my EU colleagues and all the candidate states in Luxembourg of Ireland's unwavering support for the enlargement process and our continuing commitment to the development of the Union. Unfortunately, the reason it was necessary to give such reassurances was the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum, encouraged by some in the House who protest they are in favour of enlargement.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear. The General Affairs Council conclusions in this matter, adopted yesterday, confirm that the Treaty of Nice was and is about enlargement. Enlargement remains the key historic task facing the Union and one to which all the member states and all the candidate states remain fundamentally committed. Any misrepresentation by opponents of the treaty of that basic fact does not contribute to finding a solution which will enable the enlargement process to be successfully completed.</P>
      <P>The enlargement process remains the key objective of the Union in the period ahead. The reasons for this are straightforward. Europe was artificially divided for half a century. The people of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the other candidate states clearly deserve to be part of the European Union. Their accession will do justice to their sustained and determined effort to transform their societies and economies based on democratic principles and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>We often take for granted that Europe has been at peace for over 50 years. This is in no small part due to the role of the European Union in overcoming historical rivalries and creating a Union based on democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. Perhaps in Ireland we should reflect on the alternative to a rules-based European Union. It would be a Europe dominated by the large countries where shifting alliances would lead to instability &ndash; in other words, the sort of Europe that helped create the conditions historically for conflict and crisis. It should be recalled that even during the present period instability and war are still a feature of parts of Europe outside the embrace of the Union. An enlargement incorporating the present candidates will include one of the former Yugoslav republics. Perhaps more will join in time, each enlargement reinforcing the strength and stability of a Europe voluntarily united on democratic principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic benefits of enlargement are also significant. Irish companies are already investing and trading heavily in candidate countries, maintaining jobs and prosperity here. This process will accelerate when they achieve full membership. Trade and investment are the life blood of a small open economy such as ours. Those who campaign against enlargement or the European Union put this at risk. We currently export just 3% of what we produce to the 12 candidate countries with a <Col N="1130" /> present composite population of 130 million people. The potential in terms of two way trade as colleague members of the European Union would be significant. Enlargement poses challenges for the candidate countries, many of which have only in the past decade emerged from half a century of centralised state control and isolation from markets. Ireland is sensitive to these special needs and the other needs of all the candidate countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland is looked upon as a model member state by the candidate countries. That was repeated to me by Foreign Minister colleagues from these countries whom I met today. They see us as a country which has managed its membership of the European Union well and taken full advantage of the opportunities, while at the same time maintaining a positive image with its fellow member states. I cannot emphasise enough, as Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, that it is imperative we maintain this positive image with the candidate countries. To do so now, we will need to redouble our efforts at our bilateral meetings and in our relations with these countries to avoid misunderstandings or the development of attitudes which affect our present and future political, economic and cultural interests with the peoples and Governments of these states.</P>
    <P>It would be unfortunate for Ireland if the vote last week was misconstrued as an anti-enlargement vote. It would harm our relations with future partners who will be vital to us as allies and colleagues around the European Union table. It would also result in drawing into question Ireland's positive reputation internationally as a country which supports the development of countries which are less well off than ourselves. We must continue to set the record straight in the weeks and months ahead by our words and deeds to ensure that Ireland's name does not become associated with being greedy or selfish in pursuing our interests. Ireland, which has gained so much from its membership of the European Union, believes that today's candidates have as much right as we had 28 years ago to become full members of the European Union and share in the stability and opportunity which membership brings. By overcoming this present political problem, we look forward to the candidate countries becoming full members in the near future. In the interim, Ireland will play its full part in ensuring that the accession process goes forward at the fastest possible pace. It is vitally important that we continue to take a constructive role in that negotiating process.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the false claim that enlargement could take place without the changes contained in the Treaty of Nice, as some in this House unfortunately continue to maintain. The Treaty of Nice agrees changes to the voting weights in the Council, a change that must occur for enlargement to take place. The Treaty of Nice agrees changes to the allocation of seats in the European Parliament, a change that must occur for enlargement to take place. The Treaty of Nice <Col N="1131" /> also agrees changes to the European Commission, a change which, it was agreed at Amsterdam, would be made along with changes to voting weights, prior to the first enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <P>It has been made clear that those issues are not up for re-negotiation. The treaty also makes further changes to ensure the Union can continue to operate effectively with a significant increase in membership. The Court of Justice will be improved, as will the Court of Auditors. The use of qualified majority voting has been extended, including in relation to the environment, where one recalcitrant state will not be able to block environmental measures important for Europe as a whole, which is currently the case. Small changes have been made to the already existing rules governing enhanced co-operation which allows a group of countries to co-operate more closely in certain areas provided they meet strict conditions. This will emphatically not lead to a two-tier Europe, as sometimes claimed, as the rules specifically state that no country can be excluded from an enhanced co-operation group either at the beginning or at a later stage and that they must work under Articles 43 and 44 of the treaty in a single institutional framework. It is not legally possible under the Treaty of Nice to create a club within a club.</P>

      <P>However, although the case for the Nice treaty was, to my mind, strong, the public was not convinced or did not exercise a franchise arising out of a failure to communicate the substance of the issues involved, for which we all take responsibility. Two million voters did not vote at all because of this failure by us to connect with the public on this issue. The Referendum Commission, operating independently of the Government, had the task of explaining to the public the issues involved in the Nice treaty referendum and the two further referenda taken on the same day. It was undoubtedly a difficult job and I pay tribute to its work and diligence.</P>

      <P>Whether the operation of the commission can be refined to improve voter understanding will and should be a subject for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also made strenuous efforts to inform the public of the issues at stake. We published a White Paper explaining in detail the changes which the Nice treaty would make. A summary of the White Paper was distributed to every household in the country. We had lengthy Dáil and Seanad debates on the treaty and the <Col N="1132" /> referendum, during which 58 Deputies from all sides of the House contributed. I participated in numerous television and national and local radio discussions and I joined party colleagues in campaigning on the doorsteps for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. That we were unsuccessful clearly gives us pause for thought. It is important that an historic issue, such as the enlargement of the Union, does not become a scapegoat for a protest vote in respect of disappointments people may have about a range of issues, most of them domestic policy issues unrelated to EU matters.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, our colleagues in Europe are not prepared to re-open the substance of the Treaty of Nice. In the course of negotiating the treaty, every member state made compromises, an essential part of any negotiation, but each committed itself to the final outcome. To seek to unpick the substance of the agreement and to tell 14 other countries what to do is not an option that is open to Ireland or to any other member state. That was reconfirmed by my 14 member state colleagues yesterday. We must respect that. Respect is a two-way street.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gormley is wrong when he suggests that people, when they do not agree with him, are being contemptuous. The rational thing to do is to consider how the specific concerns which emerged during the campaign and gave rise to the support for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote can be addressed, given the political and legal reality that confronts us as a country and as members of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Government has stated that nothing in the treaty undermines our policy of military neutrality. Nothing commits us to a mutual defence pact. Perhaps this reality needs to be further articulated. The issue of democratic oversight of European activities was also a recurring feature in the referendum campaign. We can surely do more at national level. I am thinking in particular of the role of the Oireachtas in scrutinising EU legislation and informing the public of what is being done at European level. I have already told the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs &ndash; the chairman is here today &ndash; that I would welcome such a development in the interest of democratic debate on EU issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of what happens in Europe, even if the general public does not follow it closely, is often relatively mundane. For example, the Commission, the Council and the Parliament have debated issues such as aircraft noise control and Community patents. However, they also consider issues of great importance for Ireland and our partners, issues such as the euro, the single currency, the Common Foreign and Security Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. In each of these areas, initiatives taken at a European level have benefited us far more than any action we could undertake at domestic level. More could be <Col N="1133" /> done to explain these processes to the public and to explain the European structures.</P>
    <P>Surveys of public opinion continue to show that a great majority of Irish people recognise the benefits of EU membership, moreover they consider themselves European in the best sense, identifying with the achievements and traditions of our continent.</P>
    <P>Many of our young people continue to work abroad, and at this point in our history, thankfully, they go voluntarily. When they return, as they usually do, they bring their experience of other European countries to enrich ours. I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, for example, when he emphasises the need to recognise the cultural as well as the economic and political importance that enlargement represents.</P>
    <P>Our people are pro-enlargement and the challenge for the Government is to ensure that this sentiment is reflected in a positive endorsement of the enlargement process and in putting in place structures for guaranteeing that the people of a small state retain their sense of ownership of the European project. It is a challenge that we must all rise to in the national interest, as full and committed members of the European Union. We fully subscribe to and derive great benefit from the treaties of the European Union which govern the operation of the institutions to date. We must reflect and then act on the issues which brought a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, so the Treaty of Nice can be seen in the same light in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share time with Deputy Coveney, giving us seven and a half minutes each. I know Deputy Joe Higgins will be very interested in what I have to say but there is no need for him to stand up during the course of my speech.</P>
      <P>This is a time when lessons can be learned by the Government, so that early and adequate debate takes place in this House and in the media on issues such as the Nice treaty. The Government must ensure when supporting and promoting a treaty such as the Nice treaty that all its own soldiers and Ministers are on board and voting in the same way. There is not much sense in having a united front and expecting the support of the Opposition to get a result, if the Government does not have its own people on board as well. I genuinely sympathise with the Minister, as it must be absolutely infuriating that somebody on the Government ship's deck voted in the opposite direction. That is the worst possible thing that can happen to dent the confidence of a Minister at any time. I am not making a political point, it is just a fact of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also lessons to be learned by the general public. I have been a member of the European Affairs Committee for a very long time, and while I am not an expert on Europe, I am a keen observer and have learned something about it. I hope we do not have a similar result after another visitation to this issue. If we do, we will go down a road which will have serious consequences for <Col N="1134" /> our economy and our people. In case the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote campaigners think otherwise, that is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>While Europe is delighted to have us on board and has helped us out in many ways, it would hate to find that when we begin to progress, we might pull the rug and move away independently. I am not so sure we are strong enough economically to do that. I hope we do not find ourselves aligned solely with our next door neighbour, in the future as we were in the past, and who so far has professed a high degree of euro-scepticism. I say that without disrespect to our immediate neighbour.</P>
    <P>There are lessons to be learned by the European leaders in general. It is not in order for a European leader at a sensitive time, to make a statement that has implications for the entire union. It is absolutely unfair to all the other participant countries should one leader set the pace for everybody and fly a political kite that suits his or her electorate at a particular time &ndash; the theory that each member state must influence to the ultimate the forward march of the Union if it goes at all. We all know if that is the case then it will go nowhere. There has to be some kind of compromise, meeting of minds or dialogue and a treaty is the only way to facilitate it.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat concerned by the Tánaiste's remarks tonight. It would not be any harm to refer back to the original vision of the founding fathers of the European Union. When they drew out their vision for Europe from the ashes of the last war, they saw the necessity at that time to move forward as one and move closer together so that there would not be the division and dissension that the Minister spoke of earlier. If that vision becomes blurred and we decide to forget about it and unilaterally move ahead in a haphazard group with some kind of flexibility to suit each country on each different occasion we can forget about progress, because it will not work. It has not ever worked anywhere, and comparisons elsewhere will show that unless there is a clear vision, unless people work together and bring others involved along with them in so far as it is possible, then nothing can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not agree there are no circumstances in which a country can be left out of the Union. We need to be careful about how we go forward now, so that we do not find ourselves on that road. It can and will happen. It can happen by virtue of our geographical location on the European map. That is a serious prospect and I hope people, as a result of this referendum, have also learned a few lessons. Far be it from me to lecture the public, but one of the lessons to be learned is that if people stay at home and allow others to go and vote one gets the decision anyway. Whether or not one likes it afterwards, one just has to put up with it and live with it. We should all learn lessons and I hope we will be able to sit down and do something positive to bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion in the future.</P>
    <P>The European Affairs Committee has tried to be the conduit for debate on this issue and we <Col N="1135" /> did the best job we could. We have often been at meetings in Brussels where other colleague countries had delegations of some 20 or 30 people, including legal teams backing them up. We do not have those kinds of resources, and we almost had no secretariat, but for the actions of the members of the committee five weeks ago. I say to the Minister that we must ensure we do not have that kind of nonsense in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday when the news broke that the public had rejected the Treaty of Nice, I was on an island, which is part of Sweden, called Gotland, in the middle of the Baltic Sea. I was attending a conference with other parliamentary colleagues from European nations, MPs and MEPs. In opening the conference the Spanish chairman welcomed, in particular, a delegation from Poland as aspiring members to the EU under future enlargement.</P>
      <P>Being in the Baltic Sea with Sweden holding the EU presidency to the west and to the east, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, four of the applicant states, I got a real sense of the enormity of the potential consequences of a rejection of the Nice treaty by Ireland. The response from my European colleagues was one of shock, disbelief and intense disappointment. I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs has also witnessed these reactions.</P>
      <P>Their shocked reaction was because the result of a referendum in Ireland could prevent or delay enlargement and a move towards a more stable peaceful and larger Europe. I had a difficult job to persuade them that Ireland's rejection of the Nice treaty was not a vote against enlargement but was because of other concerns among Irish people with regard to the issue of Europe. I believe I was correct in making these arguments and in the immediate and short-term, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, must work around the clock to explain to our EU colleagues and more importantly to the 12 applicant countries that Ireland as a nation is most definitely not against EU enlargement. It is essential for our reputation in Europe to ensure the good will shown towards Ireland by other EU member states continues into the future.</P>
      <P>We must accept the result of the referendum and analyse, as public representatives, the reasons the people chose not to follow the recommendation of the vast majority of Members of this House in rejecting the Nice treaty. If the ratification process here had been handled differently, a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for ratification was possible and a much higher turnout could also have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not enjoy personalising the blame game in relation to a referendum result, but the Government, the Taoiseach in particular and his Minister for Foreign Affairs, must take responsibility for the mishandling of the referendum. The ratification of the Nice treaty by referendum in Ireland is an issue of such magnitude and importance in <Col N="1136" /> relation to its consequences for EU enlargement that the Government needed to give much more time to inform citizens of what was contained in the treaty. What was the rush? We have another 18 months before we are required to ratify the treaty. Why did we have to be the first state in Europe to try to do so? That was the first mistake. The Government got the timing wrong. We have been reminded in no uncertain terms that people will not vote for something just because they are told to do so by a Taoiseach, regardless of how personally popular he is, or by any other public representative. Instead, people want to make up their own minds based on facts, figures and public debate.</P>
    <P>The second failure of the Government was in the campaign build-up to the referendum. The Government's failure to mobilise its own Ministers across the country, with the exception of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, did not inspire confidence in anybody to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. In my own constituency, while campaigning in Cork, people expressed amazement at the lack of a Government party presence in selling the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to the Nice treaty. It is bad enough rushing the referendum on the people without adequate information and debate, but not ensuring a vigorous campaign resulted in a disillusioned, disinterested electorate, of whom 63% they did not even feel it was worth their while going out to vote. If the Taoiseach could not even enthuse his own Ministers to campaign, how could he expect to convince the nation that it should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;? As we have seen, one of his Ministers did not even do so.</P>
    <P>The third mistake the Government made in the campaign was its treatment of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign activists during the debate. I agree with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, when they say that many of the arguments made by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners were not relevant to the Nice treaty. That may be so, but to dismiss public representatives raising issues and concerns relating to the future shape of Europe as misleading extremists receiving funding from a far right wing American financier is not the right tactic to bring people on board when trying to convince them to vote for something. There were three main factors. Timing, without adequate debate, hapless campaigning and treating the opposition to the Nice treaty with contempt led to a poor turnout and a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here? That is the question everybody is now asking. It is true that the Nice treaty cannot proceed without the ratification of all 15 member states. Despite the arguments made earlier by activists for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign, enlargement cannot happen without the ratification of the Nice treaty by all member states. The Amsterdam Treaty is not sufficient and we have heard a clear message coming from the applicant states, in particular, that this is so. I welcome the announcement of an EU forum proposed by Deputy Quinn. We clearly need a wide ranging European debate dealing with all issues <Col N="1137" /> and concerns of Irish people in relation to European issues. This has not happened yet in a real way, but it must happen before the people are asked for a second time to make a decision on the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out today that it is very unlikely &ndash; in fact, it will not happen &ndash; that the Nice treaty will be scrapped or renegotiated. For this reason, the fears that Irish people have must be dealt with through debate and real information in order that issues such as a European army, a threat to neutrality or a movement towards NATO can be dealt with in order that people can see the real truth behind them, which is that the Nice treaty does not deal with those issues. We can deal with them in other ways and in time, if the Government ensures the necessary debate takes place, people's fears about the Nice treaty and European enlargement can be dispelled.</P>
    <P>Ireland's story in the European Union has been one of success and wealth creation, one that the applicant countries admire, particularly the smaller countries seeking entry to the Union. The Foreign Minister from Estonia said today that he looks on Ireland as a role model. He wants to base Estonian policies on policies that have been put in place here in order that the people of his country can benefit in the way we have benefited.</P>
    <P>It is time now to reflect carefully on our responsibilities and the way in which we wish to move forward in a Europe that will enlarge. As a small nation, we can only do this through information and full debate. I look forward to that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sombre debate, one which would not have been expected two weeks ago. The result of the referendum is astonishing, as is the misinformation, the disinformation and the clouds of confusion on which much of the debate was based in recent weeks. It is also a salutary debate because the political establishment here has to look into its heart and understand the reason we failed in regard to this particular episode because the reality is that 96% of those who represent the public in this House, all the leaders of all the major political parties, the bulk of the leaders of the trade union movement and the other social partners were positively disposed towards the Nice treaty, yet the people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I agree with Deputy Coveney and the sentiment expressed by the Minister. There is no point in recriminations at this stage, but there is a great deal of work to be done by all of us in the political establishment to understand the complexity of the message we got last Thursday from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union and its predecessor organisations going back to the time of the ECSC have been the foundation stone on which peace, tranquillity, progress and social justice have been based on the continent of Europe for the past 50 years. I have always believed that the Irish people have adapted to the European Union not just <Col N="1138" /> because of what we got out of it, but that we were very active participants because of what we could put in. It is with a great deal of sadness, therefore, that I address the House on this particular issue.</P>
    <P>The European adventure was built out of the ashes of the war. As some here know, I have lectured on this particular aspect of European integration and history for the past 21 years. I was speaking to one of the best known authors in this area after a radio programme last Saturday and he and I simply could not believe what had happened. The great aspect of the European Union, from my point of view, was not that we had gained considerable and immeasurable financial and economic benefits, but that we had been able to elevate ourselves beyond this. As a nation, we had been able to put ourselves on an equal footing with any other European nation. We could engage in the rich and diverse culture of Europe. They got to know us and we got to know them.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;aware of the importance for the economy of the speedy delivery of the planned upgrading of our national road network;</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the need for adequate and genuine consultation with the communities affected by these projects;</P>
      <P>&ndash;mindful of the widespread concern and anxiety throughout the country on major road development projects;</P>
      <P>&ndash;concerned that the current compulsory purchase order &ndash; CPO &ndash; procedure is too cumbersome and slow and can result in unfair prices being paid to landowners;</P>
      <P>&ndash;believing that bottlenecks in the planning system are delaying the delivery of key projects and that the Planning and Development Act, 2001, has not been and cannot be implemented due to lack of qualified personnel;</P>
      <P>&ndash;knowing that in the national development plan public-private partnerships are envisaged for 11 major road projects and that the NRA has decided that this will involve widespread road tolling;</P>
      <P>condemns the Government for the delays in the delivery of the national road network and calls on the Government to immediately:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;take steps, including amending legislation, to ensure a greater level of accountability on the part of the NRA in its relationship <Col N="1139" /> with local authorities, public representatives and citizens;</P>
    <P>&ndash;establish procedures to allow for meaningful public consultation by ensuring early publication and circulation of all appropriate studies, reports, surveys, maps, constraints studies, investigations and all essential documentation and to ensure that the views of the public representatives and citizens are duly acknowledged and considered prior to the announcement of any route selection;</P>
    <P>&ndash;reform the CPO procedure; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;justify to Dáil Éireann its economic rationale for the imposition of road tolls.</P>
    <P>This motion is tabled in the context of the high levels of distress regarding the method of the roll-out of the national road network. We all agree there is a need to upgrade the national road network for a variety of reasons &ndash; safety, to minimise transport costs and improve competitiveness and, most of all, to ensure greater regional balance.</P>
    <P>There is an acceptance of the need for a national road network and agreement on the extent of the problem and how it should be addressed. In addition, for the first time a comprehensive programme of road building has been outlined in the national development plan which would, if implemented, at least lay the skeleton of a comprehensive, strategic network. The plan is not without its flaws and there are large gaps in parts of the country. However, it is the most significant plan in the history of the State. For the first time we have enough money to implement the plan.</P>
    <P>With all this in place one has to ask why it is going so badly wrong. Why is every project, whether by the NRA or the Department of the Environment and Local Government, taking so long from conception to construction? Why are communities up in arms and distressed and why do they feel that decisions affecting them are being taken over which they have no control? Why do they feel they have no one to whom they can appeal or from whom they can seek assurances? Why are individuals put in the position where the first they hear of plans to take their home, business or farm is when the postman arrives with the notice of the compulsory purchase order? Why is the CPO procedure so lengthy, cumbersome and rigid that sometimes the compensation paid bears no relation to the loss suffered by the individual or the gains which accrue to others who may not lose land?</P>
    <P>I could go on with questions. However, what it boils down to is that the system is not working for the communities on whom it directly impacts or in the national interest. Every road project, national or otherwise, is dogged by delays from conception to construction. As a result, not only does every project cost more than it should, but <Col N="1140" /> the costs of the delays are incalculable. When projects finally get to the construction stage, they do so at the cost of completely disaffected and disillusioned local communities.</P>
    <P>The problems begin at the outset, the public consultation stage. Almost overnight, we move from a situation in which everyone is in favour of a road to one in which everyone is against it. This can only be because of the totally flawed public consultation process.</P>
    <P>I am sure that local authorities and the NRA are genuinely committed to consultation. However, they are not achieving that objective. There is a lack of information and the information that is available is grudgingly given. The practice of offering multiple choices in the initial route selection can only be designed to confuse and divide communities. To offer seven or eight choices, not just regarding road projects, but also in the context of the Luas, is to throw seven or eight communities into a frenzy of anxiety. That anxiety is normally needless as the promoter knows from the outset that there is one, or no more than two, options. In most cases the preferred option has already been identified so there is an illusion of consultation and choice. This may not be intentional, but this is a dishonest approach to consultation. The public knows it is a dishonest approach which will, ultimately, be self-defeating.</P>
    <P>Most road projects fundamentally impact on people's homes, properties, businesses and way of life. When a project is announced the public craves simple, honest and direct information. People want to know how they will get to work when the road is built, how they will access farmland if it is bisected by the road, what kind of boundary will be available or what compensation they can expect. These are legitimate questions which people would be daft not to ask. However, people are not given answers early or honestly enough.</P>
    <P>People cannot be given detailed answers if there are seven or eight route options being offered. It is as if choosing a strategic national route was a matter of &ldquo;eeny meeny miny mo&rdquo;. What possessed the NRA to think that anyone would choose a route on that basis or that the public would be fooled by it? Real and meaningful consultation is not easy, as every public representative will know. Such consultation requires a knowledge of human nature and an understanding of the fears which change holds for us all. It requires communication skills and, most of all, it requires giving direct information to the public.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of European literature on how to engage in public consultation, how to get people involved in a project and how to give them a sense of ownership of a project which deals with their fears and anxieties at an early stage and overcomes objections at that stage. We must start to examine better means of communicating early with residents. We must change our approach as we are simply inviting objections. There will be <Col N="1141" /> objections, court cases and an uphill battle until the last yard of tarmac is laid.</P>
    <P>In this week of a failed referendum and a low voter turnout, when we wonder at the cause of the democratic deficit and the apparent detachment, disillusionment and disaffection of the public with the political process, we need not look much further than the farce we call public consultation. When we have antagonised all concerned at the outset, we then move to the CPO stage, which again involves a democratic deficit. Almost overnight, we have moved from a situation in which the elected members of local authorities made the CPOs for roads which were confirmed by the Minister to a situation in which the NRA makes the CPO which is confirmed by An Bord Pleanála. The Government has handed the entire process over to two unaccountable bodies and the democratic process has been bypassed.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that the motivation for this change was to speed up the delivery of the national road network. This approach might have been correct if the necessary safeguards had been put in place to protect those who are the subject of CPOs as well as those who are not. In many cases, those most affected are those who are not the subject of CPOs, communities which may not be losing land but which will be severely impacted on to the extent that the quality of life may be threatened and even destroyed. The result is that, far from speeding up the process of road building, every project mooted will end up in the courts, will take longer and cost more, and in the end no one will be happy. Motorists will not feel they have been well served by the State.</P>
    <P>The CPO system has been in operation for almost 100 years. The system is archaic, cumbersome, tortuously slow and unfair. It involves an incredible 18 different procedures which can take years to complete. Throughout the entire process, there is a dearth of information for the individual caught up in it against his or her will.</P>
    <P>If I had time I could recount many anecdotes of which I have personal experience where the lives of individuals were virtually put on hold while they were subjected to an uncompleted CPO. I could describe the stress which this limbo causes, particularly to elderly people. During this time marriages can break down, requiring a division of property, people can die or their entire circumstances can change while their property is without value and cannot be sold. During the route selection process, those affected can at least draw comfort and consolation from the support of others. However, once one reaches the CPO stage one is on one's own. Each case is different so that each individual, whether a householder, a business person or a farmer, will have to employ a consultant at his or her expense to advise him or her on the likely impact. This will not merely have a financial impact, it will also impact on the environment, noise levels and property boundaries and result in the loss of access and general inconvenience. An entire industry has grown up around providing these services for which people <Col N="1142" /> must pay directly, allegedly to promote the common good. The State could, at the very least, pay these costs.</P>
    <P>One of the most outrageous aspects of the CPO procedure is that land can be taken prior to a claim being made for compensation and without the landowner knowing what he or she will get for it. When landowners find out what value has been accorded to the land, CPOs have already been confirmed and it is too late for objections. In any case, there is nobody to whom they can object unless they opt for a costly court case. This is like someone being forced to sell his or her house without knowing how much he or she will get for it until the new owner moves in. Is it any wonder that half the country is up in arms over this procedure? When the level of compensation is eventually decided, it is subject to such outdated and rigid rules that people simply cannot be adequately compensated. Even if a valuer or arbitrator recognises that individuals have been treated unfairly, the system is not sufficiently flexible to provide for reasonable compensation.</P>
    <P>In the case of farm land, compensation is calculated with reference to agricultural prices even though they may bear no relation to the actual loss suffered, the loss not only to the value of the farm if a person were to sell it, but also to the viability of the enterprise. When land is severed from a farm or any other business, the meagre compensation allowable does not even come close to adequate recompense for the ongoing inconvenience and difficulties with which the landowners and their families must cope forever. The final insult is that when the cheque eventually arrives, it is subject to capital gains tax. It is incredible that people are taxed on a gain they have not made and a sale they never wanted in the first instance. It would be very difficult to contrive a system more adversarial, cumbersome, unfair or least likely to smooth the path for the delivery of road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>As if those who suffer CPOs are not sufficiently badly treated, those who do not have their land directly acquired, but live in close proximity to the road are probably in the worst position of all, having virtually no rights or safeguards. Entire communities and towns can be severed as a result of CPOs and the impact in these instances can be even greater than on those who lose their land. The environmental impact assessment system is the only means of protection in these cases. However, as the Minister is probably aware, this system does not always successfully identify adverse impacts and, even where it does, it effectively only pays lip service to the impact a development may have on people's lives. No real effort is made to develop ameliorating or mitigating measures to protect affected communities.</P>
    <P>Irish roads and motorways are designed to the highest specifications from which, as motorists, we will all benefit. Why is the Government so reluctant to accept that individuals bear an enormous and unrecognised private cost for these benefits? Millions of pounds can be found for <Col N="1143" /> construction costs, but such is the system's rigidity that if one is unlucky enough to be outside the line of the road and has not succeeded in hammering out mitigating or compensating measures during the public inquiry, one cannot get a single penny once the inquiry has concluded. People may only discover the adverse impact of a development subsequent to the inquiry's conclusion. I have encountered numerous examples of this in my constituency. The system is a very bad one, particularly because long delays can elapse between the public inquiry and the commencement of construction work. A road is currently being built in my constituency in regard to which a public inquiry was held 15 years ago. The traffic, noise and pollution levels projected at that stage bear no relation to the world in which the road is now being built, yet members of the public have no comeback whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I want to concentrate on the issue of road tolling and the NRA in my remaining time. This represents another sleight of hand on the part of the Government which has conveniently handed over all decisions on tolling to the NRA. The Government says tolling has nothing to do with it and Ministers are not obliged to answer any parliamentary questions or engage in any debate on the matter. On the other hand, the NRA states that when it levies tolls, it is only implementing Government policy. People want to know exactly who is in charge and actually making decisions in this area. Some 11 large and different sections of the country are to be subject to toll charges for the next 30 years, yet there has not been any public or political debate on the matter. The NRA ploughs on, completely unaccountable to anybody.</P>
    <P>True, the Government informed us that £1 billion would be raised by the private sector for road construction, but, overnight, this private sector involvement translated into road tolling as if the two were synonymous. It is possible to have public-private partnerships in the absence of tolling and equally possible to have tolling in the absence of public-private partnerships. I am opposed to neither. I am not opposed to public-private partnerships and I am not opposed to tolling, particularly where the motivation is traffic management as is the case with the port tunnel. However, I and other members of the public strongly object to the failure to provide any rationale for tolling. The Government has not even provided an economic rationale for the tolling of roads. The evidence to date shows that tolling does not deliver infrastructure any quicker or any more cheaply. Some estimates reveal that the public will pay 13 times more than necessary. It is well known that the most expensive means of road provision is private tolling.</P>
    <P>There may be some rationale for a Government toll where the user could at least be sure that the money collected would go into Irish coffers to be spent on maintaining existing Irish roads or building new ones. Why are we handing <Col N="1144" /> a virtual licence to print money over to the private sector, almost certainly foreigners? Private foreign companies will come to Ireland like bees to a honey pot at the delightful prospect of taking over responsibility for the tolling of Irish roads for the next 30 years. It is not as if Ireland does not have the money to build these roads. Today, the Taoiseach stated we were short by approximately £1 billion. We are not building particularly fast and all these roads are not being built simultaneously. It is possible to provide for longer phase-ins to the projects. Even if it did not want to do this, there is nothing stopping the Government from borrowing money which it can do quite cheaply. If it were still necessary to toll these roads &ndash; the Taoiseach appeared very concerned that they would generate a flow of income &ndash; at least we would have ownership of our roads, control over the location of tolls and the flexibility to adjust charges to prevent high diversion rates into towns which will inevitably occur if the NRA gets its way in regard to tolling around towns.</P>
    <P>It is simply not good enough to hand over control of large sections of the national road network to private &ndash; probably foreign &ndash; interests in the absence of any explanation of the necessity to do so or any democratic input into safeguarding the interests of taxpayers, motorists and the general public. If we want to build roads, the Minister must alter the public consultation procedure, provide some political direction to the NRA which should be made accountable to this House and radically revamp the CPO procedure to make it more efficient and ensure it provides for realistic compensation for affected landowners.</P>

      <P>I propose to share time with a number of my colleagues. I congratulate Deputy Olivia Mitchell on tabling the motion at a time when there is considerable anxiety about road developments throughout the country. Ireland has an acknowledged infrastructural deficit. Following years of substantial growth in traffic on our roads, it is clear we have not planned appropriately for better roads. A well functioning national road network is essential to provide for the efficient movement of people, goods and services and to secure the competitiveness of the economy and balanced regional development. In fact, the national development plan envisages spending £6.75 billion over the next six or seven years to ensure we have a proper road network. We should not forget that there are other roads apart from national roads which mean an improved quality of life to our people. I refer to our county road network which is often neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 8,000 farmers and 25,000 acres will be affected by the plans for dual carriageways and motorways under the national development plan. My constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, which is part of the south-east region, was recently shown by Central Statistics Office figures to have one of the country's lowest <i>per capita</i> incomes. It <Col N="1145" /> is cumulatively lower than in some parts of the west. It is therefore critical for the south-east and my constituency to have good roads linking airports and ports and all parts of the country from Dublin outwards. The Waterford to Dublin road was originally left out of Government decisions and the national development plan's draft proposals. Subsequently, Ministers had to reconvene in order to ensure it was part of the plan. The manner in which the plan is being implemented is causing great anger, emotion and anxiety, after all no one can expect full co-operation or understanding of what the State wishes to achieve without proper consultation and explanation of the plans for these roads. Meetings have been held in Carlow and Kilkenny to discuss the optional routes for the new M9 and M8 and are advertised as so called consultation events. That is not the reality. Officials from the NRA and the local authority are treating my constituents as bystanders to the process. The NRA describes which routes are being investigated in a so-called information campaign but it is not a consultation opportunity.</P>
    <P>We have antiquated compulsory purchase order procedures which go back centuries and desperately need to be updated in the context of these major road investments. The compulsory purchase system implies an unwilling seller and if anybody in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the National Roads Authority or even the Minister, knew anything about property they would know that if an unwilling seller is in play, particularly a farmer, you will certainly have a difficult problem on your hands. They have no understanding of the mentality of those property owners and they treat people as though they were disloyal if they do not kow-tow, lie down and do exactly what they are asked to in the national interest. It is imperative to be generous and take full account of the use for which the acquirer wants the property. I warn the Minister that he is going to have a very difficult task implementing the national plan and he runs the risk of non-co-operation on route surveys if he does not heed this debate and stop burying his head in the sand. This will further delay the objectives of the plan he has submitted which he does not want to happen.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the consultancy fees he will sanction for these road projects will comprise up to 5% of the total cost of the projects while the property owners involved will get up to 1.5%. I wish to commend an IFA document which provides a good starting point for dealing with these issues. I ask the Minister to address the issues on a human level and ensure that we have no further unjustified anxiety on the part of the people affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <P>I intend to report Enterprise Ireland to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland. It is currently running a campaign promoting business in the regions and part of which untruthfully says that rural Ireland has the <Col N="1146" /> necessary infrastructure to cope with and facilitate expansion of business. This is a grossly false and should not be peddled to the people.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority is a bureaucratic creature without nature. Public representatives, elected by the people, cannot ask any questions of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or articulate any answers from him, yet the Minister holds two crucial functions in his remit. The first is that he determines policy and the second is that he provides the money. Section 41 of the Roads Act, 1991, gives the Minister a clear direction and allows him to instruct the NRA stating:</P>
      <P>The Minister may give a direction in writing to the authority in relation to any of the functions assigned to it by or under this Act and the authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister gets what the Minister wants. The last national plan indicated that a bypass would be put around Lough Ree but not one inch of ground was acquired. We are falling further and further behind because of lack of Government impetus and clarity. The Vasco da Gama bridge across the Tagus estuary in Lisbon took five years from plan to traffic because the government was interested and introduced a special Act to take into account people's concerns and wishes.</P>
      <P>The cost of the national plan has risen from £40 billion to £47 billion since it was first introduced. This extra money is only going to be provided by extra taxation or tolling of roads. The people will rue the day they gave <i>carte blanche</i> to the National Roads Authority and the Government to introduce this extensive scheme of toll roads without adequate public transport being provided as an alternative. Look at what happened in Saleen, Castlebar, where the NRA threw £1 million to the local authority which was spare money from the Luas project. The result was an unplanned urban scheme and a family imprisoned behind 12 foot walls without sunlight or a view. If it happened in Ballsbridge or Donnybrook the national television station would be out there every week to see people illegally imprisoned by an agency of the State.</P>
      <P>I question the design guidelines brought into being by the National Roads Authority and local authorities. We in the west are left with a wide carriageway as the main artery into the region and people turning right have a serious problem at all times. I will tell you how far we have come. Today outside Frenchpark there was a long delay of traffic causing it to travel at one mile an hour. The obstruction was a man wheeling a mobile traffic light with the green light on. We have come a long way since the days of the red flag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the fact that we are going to improve our infrastructure by the development of roads. The crucial point at stake is how we are going to do it and what level of communication we will have with those con<Col N="1147" /> cerned and how involved they will be in planning the future infrastructure.</P>
      <P>As my colleague outlined earlier, approximately 25,000 acres of land will be taken over the next two or three years for necessary road development and that will involve approximately 8,000 landowners. Most of the land will have to be acquired by compulsory purchase order. In my constituency there will be approximately 400 landowners involved with land purchases for the N4, N6 and N52. It is hard for anybody to comprehend what it is like to have a compulsory purchase order placed on you which is going to affect your livelihood. I can think of one landowner in particular with a barely viable 50 acres of land. He is already struggling and compulsory purchase orders are going to take 11 of his best acres. That is going to make his farm totally unviable. How can he have a sense of the future, of being able to look after his family and feel the State is treating him properly? He is not involved in the design of the road or where it will be. He is simply told it is coming through his land, end of the story, and there is not a lot he can do about it.</P>
      <P>This is happening because we have an outdated compulsory purchase order system which dates back to 1919. It is cumbersome, slow and very rigid and it needs to be changed urgently. When one looks at the cost of new developments, about 5% of the total cost of roads goes to the landowners. Compare that to the money paid to a landowner in the case of housing or other developments. He gets a far higher percentage than 5% of the total. Toll roads are commercial developments. As those who build them will make money out of them, why is the land being taken for them, which is being purchased by CPO, not development land? How can the Minister of State subject farmers and others to payment of the agricultural rate for land which will enable commercial developers to reap a rich reward, that is, if the toll road option is pursued? With the State awash with money, as the Tánaiste said, we should be able to build the necessary infrastructure without having toll roads. In my area of County Westmeath and the midlands generally we will have to pay tolls to get to our major cities. This will affect the viability of industrial projects in our area. We will be at a disadvantage, although we are in the BMW area. Why should we be at such a disadvantage compared to industries in other areas which can avail of cities and ports without paying such tolls? This is unfair.</P>
      <P>I recently met some landowners who will be affected by this and want to convey the message to the Minister of State that if he proceeds with compulsory purchase orders in the same way as is being done at present &ndash; without communication or information, bulldozing in on top of people &ndash; he is in for a rough ride. It will be difficult to get the land needed for those roads. I ask the Minister of State to have a fresh look at the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main focus is on five national routes: Dublin to the Border, Dublin to Galway, Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Waterford. The objective of the plan is to bring these routes to high quality dual carriageway or motorway standard by 2006.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of State that the constituency of Cork South West extends from Cork Airport to Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and Dursey Sound, but does not have one mile of national primary road, yet it is 120 miles from Cork Airport to the three locations mentioned, an area much larger than many counties. The only legacy Fianna Fáil left south west Cork was to remove the railway system from Cork city to Bantry and Skibbereen and the light rail or tram from Skibbereen to Schull and Baltimore in the 1950s and sell the railway tracks to a Third World African nation. The Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Local Government in that Fianna Fáil Government told us the road from Cork to Castletownbere, Bantry and Baltimore would be reclassified to national primary status. The Minister of State will know well, having been born on the banks of the Lee, that almost 50 years later we do not have one mile of national primary road in south west Cork. That is a dismal legacy from an uncaring Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
      <P>During the past 50 years rosy promises were made, but no action was taken regarding south west Cork. For how long more will south west Cork be treated as the Cinderella region of the country, with no rail, air, ferry or primary road services? We have the largest whitefish landing port in the country in Castletownbere, the capital of the mariculture and aquaculture industries in Bantry Bay, the tourist riviera, the major agricultural region of Ireland, Carbery Milk Products as well as Bandon, Barryroe, Drinagh and Lislevane Co-ops, yet the region is starved by an inadequate road, rail and air infrastructure.</P>
      <P>It is time the Minister of State awoke from his slumbers and realised his Government is slowly strangling this region. The main focus today is on these five national routes, but the legal basis for compulsory acquisition compensation is the market value of the land required, damage to other lands of the owner through severance and other injurious effects and disturbance and other matters not based on the value of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the Minister of State gets this plan going with the blessing of the farming organisations he has no hope of getting it off the ground. In addition, he is presiding over making billionaires of those companies investing in the national road network. Will he let south west Cork to the wolves? Will he let it become a wildlife region or safari park for wealthy Europeans? We cannot live on fresh air and cold water in west Cork. The time is right to seriously consider establishing an airport in Bantry and developing a decent national primary route to west Cork. The Minister of State should consider what we are contributing to the economy. It is a disgrace to introduce this legislation and I am ashamed of the <Col N="1149" /> Minister of State, as a Corkman from the city by the Lee, to stand over this treatment of the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and wish to declare a personal interest. The proposed new route to the west divides my family farm in half.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on the CPO process and the outdated compensation procedures in place for land acquisition and the construction of the new routes. Everyone at the coalface of planning and constructing these routes agrees that a proper national road network is vital to securing the competitiveness of the economy and balanced regional development. However, the current acquisition of farm land and property using the compulsory purchase system, which dates back over a century, threatens the individual's property rights and causes immense disruption and financial hardship to stakeholders, namely, the property owners.</P>
      <P>It is evident that the cards are stacked in favour of the purchaser with the CPO powers, the National Roads Authority, through the local authorities. How can a body such as the NRA be allowed to dictate the pace and consultation &ndash; or lack of it &ndash; as it treats people as if they are bystanders in the whole process? That body is not answerable to the House or any other elected public representative. There needs to be balanced development between the need to construct these new routes and the protection of the legitimate rights of property owners, which include fair levels of compensation. Such a balanced approach will not only benefit the landowners, but also the economic interests of the State by ensuring these projects are not unduly delayed, thus leading to increases in construction costs and the economic costs to industry in the region. The current derisory levels of compensation will lead to non-co-operation and increased construction costs.</P>
      <P>How is it that there is such opposition to the current road construction programme and so little opposition to the Bord Gáis pipeline to the west? The answer is simple. BGE is prepared to adequately compensate landowners and protect the future value of their property. The difference is quite stark: the compensation for these new routes will average between £3,000 to £5,000, but the compensation from BGE is between £7,000 to £7,500, with further consideration given to the restriction on development at some future date and the farmer can still farm the land.</P>
      <P>The current situation, where many farm payments are made on an area basis or tied into acreage, has not been given any consideration regarding compensation; neither has the increase in insurance premia for public liability due to the responsibility for maintaining the boundaries of these new routes. The element of compensation as a percentage of the total budget for these new routes is approximately 7%. Any accommodation work is also taken out of this figure, which can lead to a situation where a farmer who has land acquired is entitled to little or no compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IFA has put forward a well-balanced set <Col N="1150" /> of proposals which, if implemented, would ensure much of the opposition to these new routes would be avoided. The current valuation system is discriminatory and unfair. Such a system must be based on the area of the plot of land being acquired reflecting the valuation of a similar sized plot, not its valuation as part of an undivided holding.</P>
    <P>Another contentious issue is the delay in payment of compensation which is compounded by people's liability to tax. The Government cannot give out compensation with one hand and take it back with the other. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, commending the Government's proactive approach to accelerating the delivery of an up-graded national road network:</P>
      <P>&ndash;welcomes the demonstrable progress being made in implementing the national roads improvement programme set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006;</P>

      <P>&ndash;emphasises the importance of Public Private Partnerships in harnessing necessary skills and finance to ensure the achievement of the Government's ambitious infrastructure targets; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;notes the Government's continued commitment to delivering top quality national and non-national roads.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office in 1997, this Government has recognised the importance to the economy, and for the quality of life generally, of a high quality national road network. That is why we have hugely increased the annual allocation for the national roads programme from £260 million in 1997 to £620 million in 2001. Much has been <Col N="1151" /> achieved &ndash; and is being achieved &ndash; with this investment. The House is aware of major road improvements that have been completed in recent years. I am recalling here not just flagship projects such as the bypasses of Arklow, Balbriggan, Nenagh, Cavan, Donegal, the Curlews and major new facilities such as the Lee Tunnel, the East Cork Parkway, Dunleer/Dundalk and more. I am also referring to many smaller projects, such as Clar-Barnesmore in Donegal, recently opened by the Taoiseach, which have brought welcome benefits to less populated areas.</P>
    <P>In line with the priority that it has accorded to investment in national roads since 1997, the Government decided in the NDP to further increase investment in this vital area. Accordingly, the NDP provides for a total investment of £4.4 billion at 1999 prices over the period 2000-06. This investment was to be focused on the development of five major inter-urban routes &ndash; Dublin to Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard; completion of the M50 and Port Tunnel routes in Dublin; major works on other national primary routes; improvement of national secondary routes of particular importance to economic development, including, in particular, routes of importance to tourism and routes providing access to airports and seaports; and support of the Government's road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>Improved infrastructure is not an end in itself. It is intended to improve inter-urban links, facilitate regional development and reduce journey times. On the five major inter-urban routes, the following major journey time savings are being targeted: Dublin/Border-24 minutes; Dublin/Galway-36 minutes; Dublin/Limerick-31 minutes; Dublin/Cork-58 minutes and Dublin/Waterford-31 minutes. The development programme outlined in the NDP, and elaborated in the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, provides a clear and coherent strategic framework for the development of our national roads network. It is clearly focused on providing high quality inter-urban links and addressing the most urgent needs in the network.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the national roads improvement programme is now well under way. As I have already indicated, the 2001 allocation for national roads is £620 million. This is supporting the completion of 20 projects this year including the Southern Cross Route (M50), the Boyle/Carrick-on-Shannon route (N4), the Knock/Claremorris route (N17), the Ballycarthy/Castleisland route, County Kerry (N21) and the Ardee link, County Louth (N33/M1). The allocation will also enable the commencement of work on 23 further major projects including the Dublin Port Tunnel, the South-Eastern Motorway (M50), Carrickmacross bypass (N2), Monasterevin by-pass (N7), Ennis bypass (N18) and Youghal bypass (N25).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> A broad ranging package of measures has been pursued by the NRA to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of investment projects. These include the development and implementation of revised project management and reporting guidelines, including publication of &ldquo;National Road Project Management Guidelines&rdquo; in March 2000 and the introduction of a project reporting computer system in early 2001; the adoption of revised planning and design procedures which, together with revised approval procedures introduced under the Planning Act, 2000, should reduce the time required to bring a project to construction stage from five to 3.5 years; the establishment in co-operation with local authorities of 11 regional design offices; the conclusion of a new code of practice with Duchas to ensure the more effective and timely archaeological investigation of sites in advance of road construction; the greater use of consultants for detailed planning and design of individual projects, allowing the staff of regional design offices to focus on project management and delivery and the greater use of public private partnerships.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of tolling. Major investment in infrastructure, including national roads, has been identified by the Government as a priority of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Of the total provision for the improvement of national roads in the NDP, fully £1 billion is intended to relate to private sector investment in public private partnership projects. User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major networks is required. They are considerably more widely used instruments of road financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of these considerations, more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</P>
    <P>Tolling of national roads will increase under the NDP arising from the major emphasis in the plan on the use of public private partnerships. In part, the emphasis on PPP has arisen from understandable concerns about delivering on the major programme of works to which I have referred. PPPs are being considered as a means to capture private sector skills in the areas of management expertise, financial control and technical innovation for the benefit of the project. In addition, PPPs create a means of access to private finance for major projects which will help in accelerating the development of our road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the justification for using a PPP approach is that it accelerates infrastructure provision, allows for faster implementation, reduces whole life costs of projects and creates incentives to perform that would not otherwise be there. In the experience of EU member states and that of other developed countries, use of PPP financing to deliver a proportion of major roads pro<Col N="1153" /> grammes is the norm rather than the exception. In recent times, major acceleration of roads programmes in Portugal, France and Spain have been achieved in this way. In western Europe, approximately one-third of the 51,000 kilometre motorway network is tolled.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision in 1998 to endorse the potential of PPPs led to the announcement in mid-1999 of a number of pilot road projects for implementation by the NRA. Those projects comprise the construction of a second M50 West Link Bridge; the N25 Waterford bypass, including a new major river crossing, and, the Limerick Southern Ring Road, phase 2, also including a major river crossing. The first of these projects has now cleared all statutory procedures and is about to commence construction. The second, the Waterford bridge bypass, is under consideration by An Bord Pleanála, and the third is at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
    <P>The NRA subsequently announced a further eight public private partnership schemes for the national road network. All these PPP road schemes will be design/build/finance/operate contracts with a long-term concession period, of the order of 30 years, during which the concessionaire will recoup the upfront construction costs and on-going operation/road maintenance costs by the collection of tolls. The eight new schemes together with the pilot projects involve a total roadway length of approximately 230 kilometre, requiring an estimated investment of £1,030 million with a potential private finance input of about £700 million.</P>
    <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. The NRA and local authorities are, however, required to engage in an extensive consultation process before adopting a toll scheme, which includes a requirement to hold an oral hearing into any objection to a proposed toll scheme. A comprehensive statutory public consultation process in relation to toll schemes is provided for in the Roads Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the possibility of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions. Any such policy directives may not relate to particular tolling schemes and must be laid before the House. While no such directives have been issued to date, chapter 4 of the NRA's review of 2000 and programme for 2001 sets out the key principles established by the NRA for its public private partnership programme. These principles include making an alternative toll free route available for road users, thereby giving a choice as regards paying a toll. Tolled roads will be widely spread across the main national routes and in, or close <Col N="1154" /> to, all main cities in order to create an equitable distribution of user charging. I am satisfied these principles, together with the broader policy framework set out in the national development plan in relation to public private partnerships, establish a satisfactory basis for the continued development of the NRA's PPP programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has made clear in the national development plan its plans for considerably greater use of public private partnerships in the implementation of the current national roads programme. That approach is now being taken forward by the NRA and I am confident it will improve the efficiency and the speed of delivery of the national roads programme while at the same time ensuring public accountability.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the need for meaningful public consultation in the context of major new road schemes. I fully accept that such consultation is essential and I add that such consultation is the norm. I have already indicated that the NRA is required to engage in an extensive consultation process before adopting a toll scheme.</P>
    <P>As part of major road project planning, local authorities initiate, at an early stage, a process of public consultation in connection with route selection. Typically the initial public consultation takes the form of an information brochure or similar material addressed to local communities and business interests outlining the need for the project, a general description of broad-band corridor route options and a questionnaire seeking the views and concerns of the public. In addition, public presentations are arranged by the local authority at a number of venues in the area concerned to outline the proposal and address requests for information or clarification. Following a review of the public response, together with the findings of studies conducted to identify route constraints, the local authority identifies a preferred route, which is also the subject of public consultation. The primary purpose of the consultation exercise is to bring the public up to date on developments in the planning of the project, taking account of public feedback and the findings of constraint studies and, in particular, to outline information on the preferred route option. I also understand that it is standard practice for the NRA and local authorities concerned to periodically update elected member on developments in relation to major national road projects as part of the overall public consultation process.</P>
    <P>The consultations are pre-statutory. Their completion triggers the statutory procedures for taking forward major road projects which involve environmental impact assessment and motorway scheme or CPO, as set out in Part IV of the Roads Act, 1993. These involve extensive public consultations and an oral hearing must be held by An Bord Pleanála. Any fair minded person would have to agree that a very full level of public consultation must be engaged in before a major road project is approved. This is as it should be. I ask the promoters of this motion to indicate what <Col N="1155" /> further methods of communication or consultation they deem necessary and how these can be accommodated without seriously compromising the efficient delivery of urgently needed roads infrastructure. It seems that on this issue the Opposition is trying to ride two populist horses at the same time without making it clear what it really wants, or how it proposes to integrate and reconcile the two valid public interest requirements of good public consultation and urgent delivery of roads infrastructure.</P>

      <P>In January 2001, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government commenced new provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, relating to the approval process for major road and other public infrastructure. An Bord Pleanála is now responsible for the confirmation of motorway schemes or compulsory purchase orders made by local authorities and for assessing environmental impact statements for all major local authority development, including motorways. These new arrangements, along with the new time limits for submitting CPOs and road schemes to the board for confirmation, and the power to deal simultaneously with compulsory purchase confirmations and environment impact assessment, will speed up the procedures for all types of CPOs. So that the board will have adequate resources to discharge its new responsibilities, the Minister has increased its financing by some 87% over the 2000 level and ensured that it can recruit the people it needs. An Bord Pleanála recently decided that a full independent review of its organisation and staffing should be carried out and this is under way.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have power to acquire land compulsorily to fulfil any of their duties under existing CPO legislation. The procedures are designed to ensure a full and independent assessment of the local authorities' proposal and the views of the affected land owners. Local authorities may also acquire land by agreement and the bulk of land acquisitions are managed on this basis. The scale of the national development plan both in terms of the number and size of infrastructural projects, particularly road construction, means that extensive land acquisition is involved, with undoubted disruption to many landowners, and in some cases severance of holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the system of land acquisition operates fairly and efficiently and that decisions can be made in a timely manner. The new procedures introduced in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, where the powers of the Minister for the Envir<Col N="1156" /> onment and Local Government were transferred to An Bord Pleanála will help in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is a basic principle that land owners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible. Compensation is composed of a number of elements, but the fundamental point of reference for this compensation must be the market value of the land. Compensatory provision must also be made for disturbance, severance and so on. Depending on the circumstances, these can add very significantly to the total compensation package. In addition, accommodation works such as underpasses are also catered for. Where a dispute arises about compensation the matter can be referred to an independent arbitrator for decision.</P>

      <P>The IFA published proposals for reform of the arrangements for compulsory acquisition of land. In the context of the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to the &ldquo;fair and efficient implementation of compulsory purchase orders&rdquo;, these proposals have been under discussion between the IFA, my Department and other relevant agencies, including the National Roads Authority. This process is continuing. The Government is committed to a fair and equitable compulsory purchase process. It is also determined that value for money will be obtained and that the national development programme will be delivered on time and cost effectively so that the country as a whole can enjoy sustained economic growth and a more balanced regional development.</P>

There is an important balance to be struck between these concerns and I believe our procedures are properly designed to achieve this balance. Public private partnerships using road tolls to remunerate the private sector involvement will be a significant part of the national road improvement programme as set out in the national development plan. The Government makes no apologies for this as there will be clear benefits for road users and communities as I have already outlined.</P>

      <P>For the majority of my 27 years on Cork Corporation, I have been a member of the roads and transportation committee. I have witnessed at first-hand over the years the hard battles to get funding for any major project. I have visited many Ministers in the course of that time.</P>
      <P>I like to think we in Cork would be to the forefront in putting in place a proper regional or sub-regional plan taking into account the available Cork land use and transportation study. That exercise, carried out in the greater Cork area, has become the standard exercise for other areas putting in place a development plan. The success of our approach has been borne out by the provision of all but one aspect of that programme. Construction was recently started on the Bishopstown-Ballincollig bypass in the Cork South-Central constituency. That is the final instalment of the land use and transportation study.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons the project was delayed was the fairly indifferent approach taken by central Government during the 1994 to 1997 period. At that stage we should have been building the second last phase of the programme, namely, the massive Blackpool bypass recently opened by the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace. If some of those who signed their names to this motion had been more energetic when in government and had listened to the people of Cork and Blackpool, all stages of the programme, including the Bishopstown-Ballincollig bypass, would now be complete.</P>

The achievements to which I refer were realised through the adoption of a realistic plan and a good approach and with funding from the EU. We tried to inform the people of Cork about that fact in the past two weeks but perhaps they did not listen. If we were to take people &ndash; be they officials or Members of this House &ndash; to any location to show them the <Col N="1158" /> importance of new road structures, the text book example would be Mallow in County Cork.</P>

They are acting the hard man and hard woman in their constituencies but in this House they adopt a different approach by trying to slow the Government's excellent rate of progress.

      <P>The honest commentators on the other side of the House will admit that they are surprised &ndash; in some instances they have been almost shocked &ndash; at the rate of progress on projects that were discussed for generations. I suspect that few people did so well in terms of fighting for local projects over the years that they will be disappointed when such projects are completed.

Recently, while chairing a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I brought to the attention of the chief executive officers of the NRA and Dúchas the case of the Kildare town bypass. In my opinion, much too great an emphasis was placed on the existence of snails and similar creatures on the proposed route of the bypass and that no con<Col N="1160" /> sideration was given to the health and welfare of the residents of Kildare town.</P>

      <P>I accept that everyone has a right to argue their case. If there are laws or regulations that are 100 years old, they should be examined. The Government has updated a raft of old legislation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has updated 27 items of justice legislation, one of which dated back 108 years, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, have updated our road structures. I accept that we must negotiate with people. In my opinion, the wording for this motion emanated from south Tipperary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I am sharing time with my colleague, Deputy O'Shea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important and timely debate. It is important that it comes before the House at this point. I will concentrate on the agricultural aspects, especially the compulsory purchase order procedure which is outdated, outmoded and not in line with prevailing circumstances. It involves large tracts of farmland, which is a finite resource, being compulsorily acquired from landowners <Col N="1162" /> and, occasionally, cottiers. The procedure sometimes intrudes upon small areas of land people have built up over the years through thick and thin or which they inherited from their predecessors in title and which they have helped preserve in bad times. Now that they have an opportunity to farm that land or pass some of it on to their successors in title, it is taken away by the compulsory purchase procedure.</P>
    <P>The issue is not so much that it is taken away as how it is taken away and the method of assessing compensation. The land is compulsorily purchased at a price which is wholly inadequate in so far as the method of compensation is grounded upon a legislative basis which dates back to 1919 and which is out of date, cumbersome, unwieldy, rigid and inflexible. That is the best I can say about it. In spite of the fact that the acquisition of land is based on the concept of the common good in so far as a functioning national road network is necessary, and we all accept the importance of putting an infrastructure in place to provide for the efficient movement of goods, services and people, to develop a competitive economy and to ensure areas such as the Border, midland and west region receive proper and balanced regional development, we must recognise that the CPO procedure impinges severely upon each individual's property rights and is only saved from constitutional infirmity by the fact that a compensatory procedure is an integral part of it.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise that the acquisition of land in this fashion causes tremendous disruption, hardship, stress and significant financial costs to farmers and landowners impacted upon as a result. I will give some relevant examples which show the depth of disruption which can be caused. I highlight my county of Westmeath in which a number of major road developments are taking place, such as the N6 from Kinnegad to Athlone, the N4 from Kilcock to Mullingar and the N52. As many as 400 farmers will be affected by the new road proposals which will impact upon roughly 2,000 acres of land, all of it good and arable and some of it reclaimed and built up over the years by landowners and their families. Of the 400 farmers affected, about 240 along the route of the new proposed N6 from Kinnegad to Athlone will be severely disrupted and discommoded and will suffer a significant impact upon their ability to earn a living.</P>
    <P>Those farmers in Westmeath do not oppose development and realise that, despite the drastic imposition upon and disruption of their livelihoods and way of life these roads will cause, their support for the construction of these national road networks is necessary. They support them despite the fact that some of the proposed routes criss-cross their land and sever their holdings in three or four places. One farmer in Kilbeggan will be put out of business. It depends on the enterprises involved. If a person is involved in rearing horses, the fact a roadway comes close to the holding eliminates that enterprise. Roads cannot be crossed because often provision is not <Col N="1163" /> made for underpasses. Projects are often announced as a <i>fait accompli </i>and one can only fiddle at the edges. That, however, results in neighbours being discommoded and people become agitated. The CPO system appears fine until one witnesses it in operation. All that results is people's annoyance at the manner of its operation. Its successful operation depends on the enterprises impacted upon and the opportunity people have for real consultation as opposed to apparent consultation.</P>
    <P>As I said, some holdings will be criss-crossed in three or four places which will render the continuance of some farming enterprises uneconomic and will impact severely and negatively upon the normal, quiet enjoyment by those affected of their houses. Some of the routes will come so close to their houses that they will be the equivalent of prison walls. All proposals must be reasonable, sensible and sensitive to those affected.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the problem for landowners is that the compensation procedure is inadequate because it reflects the agricultural value of the land being acquired. This is an anachronism because of what is taking place in major road development. The land being acquired should be accordingly valued at market prices which should be set relative to the price of development land and which would constitute the replacement value of the land at least. It is essential reality is brought to bear on the matter and that the price of compulsorily acquired land be related to its replacement value. Both main farming organisations have put forward significant proposals which set out the changes needed to update the existing compulsory acquisition rules and procedures used since 1919.</P>
    <P>It is essential a major overhaul of this legislation is undertaken immediately and that the essence of such an overhaul is to make the legislation more user friendly. It is a fact that land acquisition costs for the construction of roadways are significantly lower than those for housing; they are less than 5%. There is scope to meet the legitimate concerns and aspirations of landowners and put in place a replacement value method of compensation. None of the landowners is a willing seller. They have not set out to seek to have their land severed.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the concept of tolling whereby those who use the roads must pay the cost. It will be self-defeating in the long run. The economy is flush with money and we should give something back to hard pressed motorists rather than putting a tolling system in place. If the Government persists with the concept of toll roads, it will be ironic that the land which will be compulsorily acquired will become the source of significant income for the private sector involved in tolling. It is only fair and just that the compensation paid for the land reflects the use to which it will be put, which is development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> We must also take cognisance of the fact that there will also be an increased number of farmers who will seek to replace the land they lose under the road projects. They will compete with others on the open market for a limited pool of replacement land which will lead to a significant increase in the replacement price which will greatly exceed the market value paid to farmers in this instance. There should also be a significant relaxation of the capital gains tax imposed and the rollover provisions. I accordingly call upon the Government to honour and fulfil its commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to put in place a fair and efficient method of dealing with compulsory purchase orders. That should be done without further delay.</P>

      <P>The draft toll scheme for the N25 Waterford bypass proposed by the National Roads Authority has been unanimously opposed by Waterford City Council. This reflects the sense of outrage felt by the citizens of Waterford city and county and the surrounding areas in other counties that the first place tolling will be introduced outside Dublin will be on the infrastructural project rated as the most important in the south-east region by the south-east regional authority.</P>
      <P>In a recent report, the average individual income in the south-east was found to be 12% below the national average. The region has a deficit in ICT capacity and in high-tech employment.</P>
      <P>This is the region where the upgrading of Waterford Institute of Technology, initiated by my colleague, the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, has made excrutiatingly slow progress during the past four and half years under two Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education and Science, Deputies Martin and Woods.</P>
      <P>Only the East Link and West Link bridges in the capital are tolled. Over many years there has been huge State investment in the four county boroughs, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. Waterford has a single river crossing. While Waterford waited for its second river crossing, major road and river crossing projects were completed in the other country boroughs. In some which already had numerous bridges extra bridges were provided. In Cork a major new tunnel, the Jack Lynch tunnel, was constructed recently at a cost of £108 million.</P>
      <P>Why has Waterford been selected for tolling? It is indicative of the indifference and contempt in which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats hold the city. Waterford will not accept this latest insult and threatened exploitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of a second river crossing to Waterford cannot be overstated. The lack of proper road access to Waterford city has often been cited by the IDA as hampering its efforts to attract industry to Waterford. The N25 is carried over the River Suir by Rice Bridge, the single river crossing. The N9 commences at Rice Bridge and the bridge also links Waterford city to the <Col N="1165" /> port at Belview. The glaring inequity of expecting the citizens of Waterford to be tolled on their second river crossing is starkly apparent to even the most disinterested observer. Cork, with 14 bridges, was recently provided with a toll free tunnel. The injustice of this against what is proposed for Waterford is more than the people of Waterford will bear. The gun has been put to their heads. They are being told they must accept this unjust proposal or go back to the end of the queue. Once again, the message from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to Waterford is that it must accept the crumbs from the national table, be grateful and keep quiet. The day when people would accept such treatment has gone. Waterford will not accept the ultimatum that if the city wants a second river crossing, its citizens must pay for it. The constituency of Waterford will not accept this unfair and inequitable treatment.</P>
    <P>Adding to the difficulty in Waterford city is the fact that Rice Bridge is raised an average of three times per week to facilitate the passage of ships. Rice Bridge has the only opening span on the national road network. At peak periods the bridge operates at full capacity which means that for significant parts of the day the bridge's capacity is at full stretch. This illustrates the need for an alternative toll free route to Rice Bridge in order that the growing traffic requirement can be catered for.</P>
    <P>The model proposed for the city's second river crossing is based on right wing economics rather than social equity. Before any tolled route is considered there must be an adequate toll free route. There is little doubt that motorists would avail of the diminishing spare capacity at off-peak times on Rice Bridge. To attract a significant number of vehicles onto the proposed tolled second river crossing the existing route would have to be gridlocked. The second river crossing is vital to the future of Waterford and the south east region. Many workers access the city by way of Rice Bridge. These workers come mainly from Wexford and south Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Waterford is, by far, the most disadvantaged in terms of roads infrastructure, yet the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, perceive the city as a soft touch and it is singled out for incredibly brutal treatment. They would not attempt to treat Dublin, Cork or Galway in such a cavalier fashion.</P>
    <P>There are environmental features of this proposed development which would prove problematic. Roads in the city would suffer a great loss of amenity as increasing traffic levels became unsustainable. Any roads project should be based on the twin concepts of sustainability and environmental gain. Toll avoiding would be a major difficulty.</P>
    <P>We need to be told the reason Waterford's second river crossing has been selected for this inappropriate model. Why is the Government seeking to impose this model on Waterford? It is illogical and unsuitable and would compound <Col N="1166" /> growing traffic problems. Why, on the N25 route from Rosslare to Cork, is it proposed to hinder the flow of traffic at Waterford city? Why, in the face of policy throughout Europe, is the city bypass at Waterford proposed for tolling? The European norm is to toll long, inter-urban motorways, ensuring city bypasses are free.</P>
    <P>There is a solution to the problem. It is the introduction of shadow tolling. This means that a toll payment would be made to the private partner by the NRA. In this way the second river crossing would be toll free to the citizens of Waterford and the south east region. I am demanding that this option be put in place. Waterford is entitled to the same treatment as other cities. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste must not think the people of Waterford will accept this.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Penrose, raised an issue on which I, too, have strong feelings. The Land Acquisition Act, 1919, and the Housing Act, 1966, are quite unsuitable to modern conditions. The value of land should be assessed in terms of its intended use. If private individuals can invest in a roadway and make vast profits, there should be a mechanism whereby farmers share, to some extent, in these profits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose referred to the damage which can be done to a holding by road building. There is a Teagasc model for assessing the extent of damage done to agricultural holdings by such development. If a landowner loses a significant amount of land, it can be difficult to find replacement land or relocate in a convenient holding. The legislation must be changed.</P>
    <P>We must find more innovative ways of dealing with the legalities attached to compulsory acquisition of land by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Department might look at the procedures followed by An Bord Gáis, for instance. The model developed by the company is much more appropriate to the 21st century and would effect large savings to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There should be equity for landowners whose land is compulsorily purchased and becomes very profitable and there must be adequate compensation for landowners disrupted by development. Road development could make a farm enterprise inoperable.</P>
    <P>Landowners often suffer delays of up to three years while waiting to be paid, but the value of the land is set at the date the compulsory purchase order is served. There must be flexibility in this regard. Crocodile tears are shed by those who say they wish to maintain the rural population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this <Col N="1167" /> matter on the Adjournment. In reply to a parliamentary question on 15 May, the Minister for Education and Science stated that schools benefiting under the Giving Children an Even Break programme for disadvantaged schools would not lose a teacher due to falling enrolments. However, one such school, namely, Abbey boys' national school in Roscommon town, is set to lose its sixth assistant teacher next September due to the fact that it is two children short of maintaining the post. The Department of Education and Science claims that because the particular teacher was not appointed through the disadvantaged programme it cannot maintain the post. The present enrolment in the school is 172 pupils. The Department's guidelines indicate that 174 are required for the retention of the sixth assistant post in schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The parish register of births indicates a figure of 190 boys in the past five years, averaging 38 boys per year, which would indicate a healthy population growth in the area for the school for the foreseeable future. Based on the past number of new entrants and taking into account the movement of families to the town for work and other reasons, the school will reach the required number of 175 by September 2001. However, because its pupil numbers have dropped by two, the school is now 23 pupils over the number required for five teachers.</P>
      <P>Several factors within the school militate against the successful implementation of a full curriculum with only five classroom teachers and a principal at work. In the absence of a sixth assistant, the school will have no option, but to amalgamate third class, leaving it with a class size of 37 in one room. Alternatively, some of the 37 pupils could be placed with the incoming second class pupils. This would leave the class in what the Department terms a disadvantaged school top heavy and unmanageable in terms of providing proper teaching and in excess of the Department's recommended 22 pupils in second class in a disadvantaged school.</P>
      <P>Proportionately, a large number of the students have been psychologically assessed on the Department's recommendation and are now availing of special needs resource teaching each day. Nineteen pupils are receiving such teaching, which is 11% of the school's population. The number availing of learning support assistance is 24, which is 14% of the school's population. The Department has told the school that it must tolerate this situation for a further 12 month period before the sixth assistant will be reinstated, even though there is ample proof that the school will have the required numbers in September this year. How can the Minister stand over this policy of giving children an even break when a disadvantaged school such as Abbey boys' mational school is to lose one of its teachers? It is clearly a case of bureaucracy having gone mad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> Roscommon town is growing with planning permission having been granted for major housing developments in the short-term. Abbey boys' national school has a long history of providing education for boys in Roscommon town and its hinterland. It has a young, hard-working team which is providing fantastic educational opportunities for each and every student. The retention of the sixth assistant post is essential to continue the effective teaching of pupils at the school. The Minister should review the situation and reinstate the sixth teacher in this disadvantaged school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the position on staffing in the school referred to by the Deputy. The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>Enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 180 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 171 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and five mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has a learning support teacher, a special class teacher for pupils with mild general learning disability and a temporary resource teacher for Travellers.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule, to which I referred, is in the case of schools experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department if the schools meet the defined criteria. Unfortunately, at this time it is not possible to sanction the retention of the sixth mainstream teaching post for the school year 2001-02 as the school's September 2000 enrolment does not meet the retention requirement of 175 pupils. The special class post sanctioned in September 1998 was made permanent in May 2000. This post caters for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is investigating the provision of a second special class teacher post to cater for additional special needs pupils enrolled in the school. On receipt of the inspector's report, officials of my Department will be in further contact with the school authorities.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the new disadvantaged programme, Giving Children an Even Break, which I launched on 4 January last. It will run over a three year period and cost £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried <Col N="1169" /> out by the Educational Research Centre for the Department last year. A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils will be supported where necessary over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes.</P>
    <P>The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme and eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £1,969 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Where individual schools were concerned about the outcome of the survey, they were invited to make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions, including one from the school concerned, were referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and that work is being finalised. The situation of these schools will be considered further when the report of the ERC is received.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining the position on staffing matters in Abbey boys' national school, Roscommon town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The events in St. Laurence's College, Loughlinstown, County Dublin, yesterday, where the leaving and junior certificate examinations were disrupted by a fire, are deeply disturbing on two specific counts. First, the reported difficulties with regard to evacuating students from the examination hall are deeply disturbing. Second, there was evident confusion about the manner in which the students in question, particularly the leaving certificate students, are now to have their results tabulated and reported. Both matters are very serious.</P>
      <P>The question marks over the evacuation of the examination hall must be investigated and answered quickly. There must be a full examination of the facts and any deficiencies resolved. The matter can be resolved by the local fire service and I have no doubt that the Minister and his Department will ensure this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues relating to the examination itself, however, must be resolved by the Minister and his Department. On the basis of the facts as <Col N="1170" /> reported today, this incident has illustrated an incredible lack of contingency planning in the examination system. The reports today certainly came as a surprise to me. It is simply incomprehensible that the best the Department of Education and Science could do yesterday, when faced with distressed students and distraught parents, was to suggest that the students in question should hang around for a few hours and perhaps continue their disrupted examination if another venue could be found, but only if all the students decided to do so. The alternative was to accept a rather ludicrous proposition that the students in question would be awarded a mark conjured up from work they had done in the past year outside the examination process. As a university examiner and parent, I submit that this is totally unacceptable. The parents of students in my constituency who have discussed their children's situation with me find it unacceptable. The Department in circumstances such as this, should surely have a contingency arrangement which would provide for students to sit a supplementary examination held on a separate date. Anything less would be monstrously unfair to the students and parents who have already suffered disruption during the school year.</P>
    <P>Leaving certificate students are presenting for the most critical examinations of their lives. Many of the young men and women who presented at this school yesterday were doing so for the second time. They were seventh year students who have retaken the leaving certificate with many taking only six subjects with a view to gaining the necessary points for admission to specific courses in university. It would be absolutely unjust and unthinkable that they should be denied a full opportunity. To give these students a mark for work completed outside the examination system without them being in examination mode would be unjust and unfair.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister to be a fair, just and reasonable man. I am sure he shares all my concerns and I hope his reply is that a contingency arrangement will be available to the students who will be able to sit a supplemental examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little concerned about the implied criticisms of the Department and its officials regarding this matter. The events yesterday were not as simple as outlined by the Deputy because one of the difficulties was that some students who had left the building had access to papers and documents which negated the examination. That is where the difficulties arose and the students were hanging about because this had to be resolved. We must rely on the competence of the people who were present because they are good at their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless I am grateful to the Deputy for this opportunity to comment on the circumstances surrounding the fire in St. Laurence's College, Loughlinstown, yesterday afternoon during the certificate examinations. When the fire broke out, more than 150 candidates who were taking <Col N="1171" /> their geography examination were evacuated. What occurred in St. Laurence's is unprecedented. The entire cohort of geography students had their examinations interrupted in circumstances that were completely beyond their control. I know that I speak for the whole House when I say how relieved I am that all students and staff were evacuated safely and I am glad to have this opportunity to thank the staff of the school and the examination superintendents for their prompt action during the emergency.</P>
    <P>There are a total of seven examination centres in operation in St. Laurence's College for this year's certificate examinations, two for junior certificate and five for leaving certificate. A total of 165 students are entered for geography, 71 at junior certificate level and 94 for leaving certificate. Of the leaving certificate candidates taking geography, two are external candidates and 72 are repeat students. Following the outbreak of the fire, the Department was informed of the position and the school authorities proceeded to attempt to locate replacement centres in a local primary school.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service went to the school immediately to assist the school authorities and examination superintendents, and to be available to students where required. Following an assessment of the position, and having regard to the informed views of the school authorities, it was decided that it was not feasible to resume the examination.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the inconvenience and anxiety caused to students, their parents, school authorities and teachers. For this reason, I arranged for officials of my Department to attend the college today to be available to all concerned in the school, especially the students, and to engage with the school authorities to consider the optimum response from my Department and the school for the purpose of ensuring that the students in question will receive a grade in geography.</P>
    <P>To this end, I am glad to inform the House that a meeting with the school authorities was held in the Department earlier this evening. This was attended by the principal, deputy principal and teachers from the school as well as inspectors and officials from the examinations branch of my Department. I asked that the meeting would finalise alternative arrangements to be put in place for the leaving and junior certificate examinations at St. Laurence's having due regard for the integrity of the examinations, inter-candidate equity and the relative significance attaching to these two differing examinations.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's events at St. Laurence's College were unprecedented both because the evacuation occurred during the course of the examination and the incident resulted in the loss of the examination to an entire cohort of students in the school. Moreover, the composition of the leaving certificate student group in the school, with its <Col N="1172" /> high number of repeat candidates, adds to the unusual nature of the case.</P>
    <P>I have just been briefed on the outcome of this meeting where it was decided, in view of the wholly exceptional circumstances of the incident, to operate contingency arrangements for the leaving certificate geography examination at St. Laurence's. Officials from my Department will finalise arrangements with the school authorities for the running of a further geography examination for the leaving certificate students, using back-up examination papers. The contingency arrangements have always been in place. The date and time of the sitting of the contingency leaving certificate examination in geography will be confirmed by the school authorities to the students tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In the case of the junior certificate candidates, the Department intends to engage with the school authorities so that a grade in geography may be awarded to the students involved. It has been agreed that officials from my Department will be in further contact with the school authorities to enable the chief examiner for junior certificate geography to compile adequate supporting evidence to determine a grade for each candidate. These grades will have the full endorsement of the Department. I am most grateful to the principal and staff of St. Laurence's College for their co-operation in facilitating these alternative arrangements.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit as teacht isteach chun an cheist a phlé. Like the Minister for Education and Science I wish success to all those involved in examinations. Students who are affected by air traffic noise around Dublin Airport particularly need our good wishes as it is not easy for them to study.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to focus on the folly of a plan for a further runway at Dublin Airport which will lead to air traffic flying directly over the Portmarnock area in my constituency. Ryanair strongly opposes the new runway. It has been planned in the absence of an aviation policy for Ireland, a wider study of the aviation needs of the State and an environmental impact study. Many people are asking whether this rushed plan for a runway has more to do with privatisation of the airport than serving the wider needs of the community and the country in general.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the proposal by Aer Rianta to foist another runway on the communities near Dublin Airport which has reminded many about the lack of regulations governing airport noise. It is still one of the greatest scandals of the last decade that the Environmental Protection Agency pointedly failed to accept responsibility and is not legally required to accept responsibility for airport noise. Is it not strange, for example, that a car driver can be prosecuted for blowing a horn late at night, yet aeroplanes can come and go with impunity throughout the night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of not having a policy on airport noise is shown in letters which the Minister got from my constituents. One letter stated that the person was woken from their sleep at 4.29 a.m. by an aircraft flying past and that they were unable to go back to sleep for over an hour due to subsequent aeroplanes at 4.42 a.m. and 5.01 <Col N="1174" /> a.m. Another letter sent to me on Good Friday stated that the person concerned was awakened from their sleep by the roar of aircraft leaving Dublin Airport at approximately 7 a.m. The person counted at least 25 other aeroplanes roaring by up to 8 a.m. The noise from the aircraft was particularly loud that morning and the person felt a different flight path nearer to Pormarnock had been used as aircraft leave by a similar route nearly every morning of the week with a much reduced noise level. There are many such accounts of noise from aircraft.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the Government does not have a policy on airport noise, unlike other countries which have taken the issue more seriously. Aer Rianta has acknowledged in writing that there are deviations from flight paths. However, it seems to be able to make such deviations with impunity. There are plans to introduce monitoring equipment, but we need to know where it will be used. This is another case of Aer Rianta policing itself. Pilots at Dublin Airport report that there are curfews at other airports around the world. However, there is none in Ireland. We need to look at international experience in order that we can provide a reasonable quality of life for the people living in the area.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a wider aviation policy which is both innovative and based on the sustainability of air transport. It is worth noting, although it may seem strange to people now, that there is more focus on air cargo transport in Holland, England and the United States. Airships are used which rely on a non-combustible gas, which is more modern and safe than the ill-fated one used in the 1930s. Aeroplane engines must generate thousands of pounds of thrust to get the heavy vehicle off the ground, but the modern airship needs little power to launch it into the air currents above. It, therefore, requires only a fraction of the fuel and generates only a fraction of the noise. We must, when framing an aviation policy from a strategic point of view as an island nation, look at the innovative means by which people are developing air transport which is both sustainable and takes into account the sensitivities of communities living close to the airport.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. On behalf of my senior colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, who cannot be here this evening, I would like to outline the position on the issues the Deputy has raised. The Minister is aware of the concerns of some residents living on the approach flight path to Dublin Airport regarding aircraft noise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Airport is the country's main access point by air and serves the growing needs of the travelling public in our capital city and surrounding counties. It is also the main facility catering for the needs of our tourism, business and freight <Col N="1175" /> sectors nationally. While traffic through Shannon and Cork airports and the regional airports continues to grow, Dublin Airport is and will remain critical for continued national economic development. Apart from its significance for the development of the national economy, Dublin Airport will also continue to be highly significant for the local economy of Fingal county where it provides substantial and valuable employment for the people of the surrounding areas both directly and indirectly through the many service industries which have grown up in and around the airport. It is against this background and recognising the pivotal role of Dublin Airport in Irish aviation and the national economy that the question of aircraft noise needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>The regulations which apply in Ireland to aircraft noise levels are those which have been promulgated at international level by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European Union. Under these regulations, the older and noisier generation of aircraft will be banned from European Union airports, including Dublin Airport, from 1 April next year. As regards developing policy on noise generally, the meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers last December reached agreement on a proposed directive on the assessment and management of environmental noise. The overall aim of the proposal is to ensure actions are taken to reduce environmental noise levels where necessary and prevent levels currently deemed to be satisfactory from increasing. The proposed directive deals with ambient noise from industry and major transport sources, including larger airports.</P>
    <P>The proposals provide for the competent authorities to prepare and adopt noise maps and action plans and make noise information available to the public. These action plans must be drawn up for, <i>inter alia</i>, airports with over 50,000 take-offs and landings annually, which would include Dublin Airport. The proposal is under consideration by the European Parliament and Ireland has supported its development to date.</P>
    <P>There are positive developments with regard to aircraft noise management in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. Aer Rianta has advised that, in conjunction with representatives of the aviation industry, it has recently developed a new noise management strategy for Dublin Airport. An important part of this strategy will be the installation and commissioning by Aer Rianta of a noise and flight track monitoring system. It is planned to have the equipment in place by the end of this year. This system will provide precise measurements of the noise generated by all aircraft arriving or departing at Dublin Airport and also monitor and record the flight path taken by these aircraft. The noise and flight track monitoring system will assist in ensuring local communities experience the least possible disturbance from aircraft noise. It is the intention of Aer Rianta to make this information available to all interested parties and enter into discussion with <Col N="1176" /> all local interest groups in an effort to further reduce the impact of aircraft noise on local communities. The accuracy of the information gathered can be audited if necessary. The Irish Aviation Authority will support the aircraft track anal noise monitoring system by making available radar data. The authority has also assisted in alleviating the impact of aircraft noise by the introduction of departure procedures at Dublin Airport which minimise the impact of aircraft on major residential areas.</P>
    <P>As regards air traffic and airport development in the context of regional development, traffic at Shannon and Cork airports, which are owned and managed by Aer Rianta, has grown strongly in recent years and Aer Rianta is investing heavily in their continued development and promotion. The Minister wishes to remind the House that the Government is committed to supporting the smaller regional airports and has been providing financial support to assist the development of these airports through marketing grants, capital grants and by subsidising regional air services. While these airports are important to the regions which they serve, it is neither feasible nor realistic to propose that they could in some way cater for the traffic which wishes to fly into Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport, as well as the other Irish airports, must be in a position to provide the facilities necessary to cater for future traffic growth and, accordingly, the Minster has no plans to introduce night time curfews or cap the growth of Dublin Airport at this time. While the concerns of residents about aircraft noise are recognised, the needs of other sectors, such as manufacturing industry, international cargo operators, charter operators and their passengers must also be borne in mind. These sectors rely heavily on open access at Dublin Airport, particularly in view of modern &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; distribution methods which are essential to the functioning of modern international companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister is awaiting the outcome of Aer Rianta's review of its long-term master plan for Dublin Airport. These sectors rely very heavily on open access at Dublin Airport, particularly in view of modern &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; distribution methods which are essential to the functioning of modern international companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister is awaiting the outcome of Aer Rianta's review of its long-term master plan for Dublin Airport. That review is being carried out in consultation with the stakeholders, including airlines and other business customers and local residents. The plan will determine the key requirements in terms of fixture development of infrastructural facilities to ensure that the airport has sufficient capacity to meet future demand. That process of stakeholder consultation is not yet complete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the expert group that the marts will open next Mon<Col N="1177" /> day, and that the permit system introduced to control foot and mouth disease is being lifted. I believe there is also an exemption to the retention period of 30 days for cattle exports. I welcome that part of it, as does every farmer and co-operative livestock mart in the country.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State well knows, there is a large amount of store cattle, particularly in the area we come from, as no farmer has been able to sell a tail since last February. There is a great need to create a competitive environment to allow the export of live cattle.</P>
      <P>I have had several phone calls this evening from buyers regarding the export of cattle, and this is the issue I will address now. It is one thing to get farmers to bring their cattle in to the marts, but it is another matter altogether to get people to buy them. I do not hold a candle for livestock dealers as such, I have no reason to do so, except to say that in my experience nine out of ten of them are fine, decent people that have a job to do. A number of them dirtied their bibs, and they should be ashamed of themselves. I hope that the law will take its course. I refer to the bona fide people that are part of the jigsaw that makes up the cattle trade.</P>
      <P>As yet, there are no buyers registered with the Department, and they have not been asked to register. While it is now a legal requirement to register, the Department have not implemented it. Will the Minister give an undertaking in this House tonight, that people who are bona fide dealers who meet the specifications in every other respect, will be allowed to operate as normal next Monday morning? It will be a shambles if they cannot, and the Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position with regard to the lairage allowed within the permit and licensing system? If an exporter from Italy wants some 300 to 400 cattle in a hurry they are collected from up to ten or 15 different marts in the same week. To collect the stock, are people who normally buy cattle allowed to use their own premises to batch them for the ship at Rosslare? Any unreasonable impediment would have a detrimental effect on the trade on top of the inevitable departmental rules and regulations, such as TB and brucellosis testing, CMMS, the contact with the Department and the Department inspector on site at the mart. Will there be any extra restrictions next Monday morning?</P>
      <P>I assume the Government is committed to the trade in live cattle, irrespective of the huge concern that has been expressed by interest groups both in Europe and here to stop it. It will be a very bad day for Ireland and Irish farmers, the same as it would be for any other sector in Irish business life if they could not export their products for sale. If the European Union means anything then it should allow for a common market where our goods and services can be traded with our partners. Will the Minister give some indication in his reply as to when the sheep sales will recommence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both I and my ministerial colleagues have, on an ongoing basis, kept both Houses of the Oireachtas informed of progress in relation to foot and mouth disease. On a number of occasions we have been obliged to introduce a range of new or developing controls designed to keep foot and mouth disease out or to prevent its spread after the outbreak in Proleek in County Louth which was confirmed on 22 March.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that in recent weeks the tenor of these contributions has changed somewhat, and that we have been in a position to announce a series of adjustments to the control measures adopted, which take account of the gradual reduction in the risk of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>These adjustments have been adopted on the basis of advice received from the expert group with which all Deputies are, by now, quite familiar and have, in a controlled way, allowed for the phased resumption of normal activities in a manner calculated to balance the residual foot and mouth disease risk with the real need to begin to resume normal activity to the greatest degree possible.</P>
      <P>In this context, my colleague the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has today announced the latest in a series of adjustments in the foot and mouth disease controls on the basis of the recommendations of the expert group which met this morning.</P>
      <P>I am confident these latest adjustments will go some considerable way towards facilitating normal trading activities and live exports which are so essential to provide the market balance needed by producers in Ireland, and which will continue to be an essential feature of the livestock trade here. The following adjustments have today been made in relation to cattle: as and from 18 June, marts may reopen; multiple pick-ups and destinations will be allowed in respect of movements to marts, export points and factories; the 30 day holding period for sales through marts and for farm to farm movements will be retained, but will not apply in respect of cattle going for export through approved assembly centres; and the permit system for farm to farm movements and for movements to Northern Ireland will be retained.</P>
      <P>In addition, I confirm that the permit regime is being discontinued in respect of movement of cattle to marts for slaughter, within holdings and for export except for exports to Northern Ireland from centres which do not have CMMS facilities. I also confirm the removal of the &ldquo;7 day&rdquo; rule in respect of sales after buying-in, and the removal of limitations on pick-ups and multiple destinations. I am aware that these latter limitations were causing particular difficulties for farmers in the more remote areas of the country where it was simply not practical for many farmers to transport economic loads over long distances to marts or factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the existing regimes for sheep and pig movements are being retained for the time <Col N="1179" /> being. In this regard, permits will issue only in respect of movement to slaughter and on welfare grounds, and for export also in the case of pigs. The House will be aware that in the case of these species, there are particular risks in sheep because of the difficulty in the clinical diagnosis of the disease and the length of the incubation period, and in pigs because of the scale on which they shed the virus.</P>
    <P>These controls will continue to be reviewed in the light of the ongoing programme of serology testing which has been under way since 10 May. I draw the attention of the House to the continuing incidence of FMD in Britain, which constitutes an ongoing risk to this country. I cannot stress enough the need for continued vigilance, best practice in relation to all aspects of animal husbandry and the maintenance of effective disinfectant measures. My Department will shortly give <Col N="1180" /> further guidance to, <i>inter alia</i>, farmers, marts, and meat plants on bio-security arrangements and other aspects of their operations, designed to protect against animal diseases, and will hold discussions with marts to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place in advance of the reopening of marts on 18 June.</P>
    <P>We have made huge progress. Every week we can proceed in a positive way but that is all contingent on making sure there are no further outbreaks. It is always a balancing act and the old Latin saying, <i>festina lente</i>, is certainly true in this case.</P>

      <P>As part of a systematic approach to progressing the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, I signed the Commencement Order for section 32 of the Education Act, 1998, dealing with the establishment of the Educational Disadvantage Committee, in December last.</P>
      <P>I subsequently announced on 12 February 2001 that the Educational Disadvantage Committee would be chaired by Professor Áine Hyland, Vice-President and Professor of Education, University College Cork.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Section 32(1) of the Act, I have consulted patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and other organisations which have aims and objectives or experience in the area of tackling disadvantage and have requested potential nominees willing to serve on the committee. The closing date for receipt of nominations was 30 April 2001, but not all organisations had responded by that date.</P>
      <P>I am currently finalising arrangements regarding the composition of the committee and I intend to announce the full membership of the committee shortly. The final size and composition of the committee will be structured with a view to ensuring that it can do its work in the most effective way possible.</P>
      <P>The main terms of reference of the committee are to advise me on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I have also decided to set up a larger forum to address educational disadvantage. This forum, which will have a broader representation than the committee, will meet twice a year. It will have a vital role in advising the committee on broader issues relating to disadvantage and exclusion from the full benefits of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 587 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has today approved for publication the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001. I intend to publish the Bill tomorrow. The Government also agreed that the enactment of this Bill will be given the highest priority. It will be a matter for this House and the Seanad whether the Bill will be enacted before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed to a draft scheme of a Bill at the end of February. In addition to the time taken to draft a complex Bill, my Department has engaged in a process of detailed consultation on the proposed provisions with support groups for former residents of institutions, their legal representatives and other interested parties. In the circumstances the time taken to bring the Bill to the stage of publication has been reasonable.</P>
      <P>In deciding to establish a scheme under which financial awards from public funds can be made to victims of abuse, the Government had regard to the special responsibilities that public bodies had for residential institutions such as industrial and reformatory schools, responsibilities that did not apply in the case of ordinary primary and post-primary schools. In the case of residential institutions, public authorities had formal and, in most cases, statutory responsibility both for placing the children in the institutions and for regulating all aspects of their operation. To a significant degree, the State, through these public bodies, replaced parents as the natural protectors and carers of the children concerned. This placed an onerous moral and legal responsibility on the public bodies for the care and welfare of the children. This, in turn, places a special responsibility on the State to try to provide redress to people who suffered abuse while in its care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards ordinary schools, these institutions were very different in their purpose, operation and management from the residential institutions. In particular, they did not have the kind of total control over the lives of their pupils that the residential institutions had. The children in these schools overwhelmingly continued to live in their homes under the care of their parents. Furthermore, in the regulation and supervision of the <Col N="1183" /> schools, public bodies did not have the kind of powers and duties that applied in the case of the residential institutions. The special responsibility which the State had for children in industrial and reformatory schools and similar places did not apply in the case of ordinary schools.</P>

      <P>The Bologna Declaration is a commitment by the initial 29 signatory countries to the establishment of a European area of higher education and to the promotion of the European system of higher education in a global context.</P>
      <P>A set of objectives was drawn up and agreed by the signatories. These objectives include: adopting a two cycle system, a system of easily readable and comparable degrees; promoting systems of credit accumulation and transfer; promoting mobility; promoting co-operation in quality assurance; and promoting the European dimension in higher education.</P>
      <P>European Ministers in charge of higher education, representing 32 signatories, met in Prague on 18 and 19 May to review the progress achieved in relation to the Bologna Declaration and to set directions and priorities for the coming years of the process. Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the objective of establishing the European higher education area by 2010.</P>
      <P>The Ministers said efforts to promote mobility must be continued to enable students, teachers, researchers and administrative staff to benefit from the richness of the European higher education area, including its democratic values, diversity of cultures and languages and the diversity of its higher education.</P>
      <P>The Ministers committed themselves to continue their co-operation, based on the objectives set out in the Bologna Declaration, building on the similarities and benefiting from the differences between cultures, languages and national systems, and drawing on all possibilities of intergovernmental co-operation and the ongoing dialogue with European universities and other higher education institutions and student organisations, as well as the Community programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The twin principles of institutional autonomy and diversity emphasised in the Bologna Declaration and the Prague Communiqué are well developed in Ireland, where our higher education institutions will, along with their European counterparts, be active participants in the achievements of the broad objectives of the declaration. Our higher and further education system is based on the binary system with complementary roles for the university and technological sectors. The diversity of institutions and the separate <Col N="1184" /> missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained to ensure maximum flexibility and response to the needs of students and the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
    <P>I have established a steering group, representative of all the relevant interests in relation to the progressing of the Bologna Declaration objectives. In that context, a national conference on the Bologna Declaration was held on 9 May 2001. It involved all partners in higher education and the wider social partnership.</P>
    <P>The steering group will meet again shortly to review the outcome of the Prague meeting of 18 and 19 May and the national conference.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Bologna Declaration coincide with the Government's recent establishment of the National Qualifications Authority, which is charged with the development of the national framework of qualifications and which will, in turn, have responsibility for the development of the international linkages so vital to the promotion of mobility &ndash; a key objective of the Bologna Declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than 24,000 whole-time teacher equivalent posts allocated to second level schools in the current school year. The vast majority of the posts are filled on a permanent whole-time basis. According to records in my Department, approximately 1,500 teachers are employed in a temporary whole-time capacity and 2,000 teachers are employed in eligible part-time positions in the second level school sector.</P>
      <P>I am aware of certain difficulties of schools in the recruitment of teachers in specific subject areas. The level of difficulty varies by location, subject combinations and the tenure of the post available. While principals have reported difficulties in recruitment in certain areas, my Department is not aware of any second level school that has not filled its approved teacher allocation for the current year.</P>
      <P>Vacancies in schools arising from career breaks, approved leave of absence or secondments and concessionary posts, which are allocated in excess of a school's normal quota of posts, may only be filled in a temporary or part-time capacity. In addition, to ensure that schools have the flexibility to meet the curricular needs of their students, particularly in minority subject areas, it is necessary for them to appoint temporary or part-time teachers.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the EPT scheme, EPTs who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required. Most teachers initially employed as EPTs subsequently apply for and are appointed to permanent teaching posts in their subject areas. They are entitled to incremental and pension credits for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken in recent years to address the job security of temporary teachers. The PCW agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers provided for the conversion of posts from temporary to permanent status and for an increase in the number of allocated posts which school authorities may fill on a permanent basis. The agreement also provided for the establishment of a qualifications committee to determine suitable qualifications for appointments to permanent teaching posts in vocational preparation and training courses. This committee has recently agreed qualifications and experience requirements in the areas of beauty therapy, hairdressing, veterinary studies and arts administration. This will enable teachers with these qualifications to be appointed in a fully qualified capacity and apply for suitable perma<Col N="1186" /> nent posts. The work of this committee is continuing.</P>
    <P>The Irish language requirement has been removed for general teaching posts at second level. This has enabled teachers, who were previously regarded as ineligible, to apply for temporary or permanent teaching posts.</P>
    <P>A review of the EPT scheme for VEC teachers has recently been carried out, and improved arrangements in regard to EPT contracts have been agreed. Vocational education committees now have the option of allocating EPT hours over more than one school and EPTs whose hours fall below the threshold, 11 hours per week, required for a contract will be offered any residual hours that may be available.</P>
    <P>The job security of temporary teachers is also related to the number and type of posts available. In this regard, the position at second level has significantly improved in recent years. In 1999, 225 additional posts were created. In the current school year, 1,000 additional posts were created and a further 400 new posts will be created over the next two years in accordance with the terms of the programme for prosperity and fairness.</P>

      <P>Apprentice numbers have expanded significantly in recent years. The apprentice population has been increased from 6,555 in 1996 to more than 25,000 in 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department has responded to this dramatic growth by increasing the provision of apprenticeship training places in the education sector from 4,000 places in the 1997-98 academic year to 8,896 training places in the current academic year. It is expected that more than 1,100 additional training places will be provided in the academic year 2001-02. Some 700 extra places were provided on a summer course in 2000. Plans are also being finalised with regard to conducting a summer course this year which will provide training for a further 1,000 apprentices.</P>
      <P>The substantial increase in apprentice numbers over a short period has led to some problems in developing capacity fast enough to cater for apprentices when they are due to attend their phase-4 and phase-6 training. However, I am satisfied the measures taken to date are addressing these problems and that sufficient training places will be provided to meet the current and projected demand.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with FÁS, is continuing to monitor the requirement for training places for apprentices. This will inform the planning of additional provisions for the future.</P>

      <P>At second level, an additional 1,000 posts have been created in the current school year. A proportion of these posts has been utilised to facilitate the reduction in the pupil-<Col N="1188" /> teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1. The balance has been targeted at particular programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the junior certificate school programme and the stay in school retention initiative.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office, the pupil-teacher ratio at second level has been reduced from approximately 16:1 to under 15:1 in the current year.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an additional 200 posts will be created at second level in each of the next two years. This increase in posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio in the sector.</P>
      <P>At primary level, 350 new teaching posts are allocated for the 2001-02 school year. These posts were agreed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In addition, a further 45 posts which arose from the retention of the demographic dividend were also allocated for the 2001-02 school year. The allocation of the posts was finalised following discussions with representatives of the partners in education and the circular letter that outlined the staffing improvements for the 2001-02 school year issued recently to the boards of management of all schools.</P>
      <P>I expect that the overall pupil-teacher ratio for the 2001-02 school year will be 19.2:1. This compares with an overall pupil-teacher ratio of 22.1:1 in the 1996-97 school year.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is proposed to appoint an additional 550 primary school teachers between the 2002-03 and 2003-04 school years. I expect that discussions with the partners on the allocation of these posts for the 2002-03 school year will commence in December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salaries. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools <Col N="1189" /> towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and affords boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. I do not consider that it should be replaced by a scheme of direct payment by my Department.</P>
    <P>At primary level, I increased the grant rates by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil, with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum, which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or fewer.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, was increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will be further increased this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments.</P>

      <P>Waterford Institute of Technology made a proposal to my Department in May 1998 indicating that the existing campus lands were inadequate for future developments and particularly for outdoor student recreational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response, the then Minister for Education and Science sanctioned the purchase of an additional 50 acres of land by Waterford Institute of Technology. As the vendor was prepared to sell 170 acres of the property as a single lot, the institute was allowed, as an exceptional matter, to acquire the entire lot at a price of £2.45 million subject to: a feasibility study being undertaken of the 170-acre site to identify lands surplus to the needs of the institute and amounting to <i>circa</i> 100 acres for disposal as directed by the Minister for <Col N="1190" /> Education and Science; moneys received from the disposal of any lands being refunded to the Department of Education and Science; freehold title to the lands being confirmed; and full vacant possession being achieved.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the purchase of the land, a portion of the site &ndash; 24.4 acres &ndash; has been subject to a compulsory purchase order from the National Roads Authority, leaving 145 acres for consideration.</P>
    <P>Waterford Institute of Technology submitted a feasibility study for the lands very recently and officials of my Department are now considering that study.</P>
    <P>The development of any facilities at the site in question will be subject to the usual project appraisal and will have regard to such factors as projected student enrolments and the skill needs of the economy.</P>

      <P>The social inclusion unit was established in December 1998. The objective of the unit is to co-ordinate my Department's policies and programmes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion. The current staffing levels are: one principal officer, one assistant principal officer, one shared assistant principal officer who has other duties in the area of youth affairs, one higher executive officer, one part-time executive officer and one clerical officer.</P>
      <P>The wide-ranging work programme includes representing the Department on the following: interdepartmental policy committee on the national anti-poverty strategy jointly led by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Social, Community and Family Affairs; national steering committee for the integrated services process, soon to be completed, which fulfilled the co-ordination role for the process on behalf of the Department in addition to providing a staff member for the Dublin 8 implementation team; interdepartmental policy group on the national drugs strategy to which the national drugs strategy team reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also acts as both an internal and external contact point for queries regarding educational disadvantage and liaises regularly with sections in the Department that deliver programmes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage; co-ordinates material for the monthly social inclusion senior officials group and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion; acts in a liaison role for my Department on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness providing regular updates on the educational components in same and addresses queries raised; maintains links with the <Col N="1191" /> national education co-ordinator and local education co-ordinators in the 38 area-based partnerships; prepares the departmental input into the annual national anti-poverty strategy report; represents the Department on the Dublin Inner City Partnership and other committees as required, such as the Inter-Departmental Committee on Homelessness, the Youth Homeless Forum and the review groups on school meals and back-to-school footwear and clothing; acts in a liaison role in support of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin. The section co-ordinated the survey of spare accommodation in all primary and post primary schools in support of the national child care strategy during 2000 and co-ordinated the Department's input into the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion submitted to the EU on 1 June 2001.</P>
    <P>The unit is currently leading a working group on educational disadvantage as part of the review of the national anti-poverty strategy in accordance with commitments given under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As part of this process, a national consultative seminar was held on 24 May, attended by 110 delegates, and the final report will be completed by the end of June.</P>

      <P>While I have not received any formal objections from the Irish National Teachers Organisation about the use of curriculum profiles, I am aware of concerns among some Irish National Teachers Organisation members regarding the use of the Drumcondra English profiles in schools. Concerns have been expressed, for example, that the individual profile cards are too detailed; that their use would be too time-consuming; that teachers will spend too much time testing rather than teaching; and that the validity of the indicator sets is questionable.</P>
      <P>My officials are involved in discussions with the Irish National Teachers Organisation on this matter and I understand that the Irish National Teachers Organisation is not opposed to curriculum profiles <i>per se</i>. It fully appreciates that the use of the Drumcondra English profiles, which were supplied to all schools by my Department, is not mandatory and that teachers and schools are free to use them to the extent that they find them of benefit.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> As I am anxious to facilitate the use of the curriculum profiles, I have asked my officials to make contact with the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, and the Irish National Teachers Organisation with the purpose of establishing a representative committee to oversee a project that could address the concerns of teachers regarding the use of the Drumcondra English profiles. This project would involve testing the use of the profiles in a small sample of schools and making recommendations as to how they might be improved if difficulties are experienced in their use.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department will also discuss issues relating to assessment, including the use of profiles, with representatives of the NCCA next week.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide educational welfare service, with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. The board will be given a lead role in developing co-ordinated supports and strategies to promote and encourage regular attendance at school and to ensure that young people remain actively involved in education up to early adulthood.</P>
      <P>Nominations to the board have now been received. On 29 May, I announced the establishment of the new board. The board is established on an interim basis at this stage. The first task of the new board will be to draw up detailed plans and preparations for phasing in an education welfare service, as provided for under the legislation.</P>
      <P>The recruitment and deployment of educational welfare officers will be considered by the board as part of the planning and preparations for the implementation of the provisions of the Act. The Act provides for the appointment of educational welfare officers and stipulates that existing school attendance officers will transfer to the board when statutorily established. The recruitment and employment of school attendance officers since July 2000, when the Education (Welfare) Act was signed into law, is a matter for the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the planning and preparation process for full implementation of the provisions of the Act should proceed as speedily as possible. To that end, the inaugural meeting of the new board will take place this week.</P>

      <P>The special education review committee identified 12 distinct categories of disability and, in respect of each category, recommended a specific pupil-teacher ratio. The staffing levels provided to special schools and to special classes, attached to mainstream schools catering for children with disabilities, reflect the pupil-teacher ratios recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, the Government formally recognised the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Provision is now made by my Department for such children in special classes, which operate at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. All such classes have the support of two special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>Many children with special needs are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher service. In determining the level of resource teacher support provided to such children, the nature and level of the particular child's disability is considered, along with the pupil-teacher ratio applicable in special schools and special classes catering for children in that disability category.</P>
      <P>Thus, for example, children with a mild general learning disability attending a special school or special class dedicated to this category of disability will be supported at a pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1. A child with a similar disability attending a mainstream class on a fully integrated basis would be entitled to one-eleventh of a resource teacher. However, given the varying degrees of special needs which can arise, even within a particular disability group, decisions on resource teacher allocations will always have regard to the particular needs of the individual child. Where the assessed needs of the child require it, additional resource teacher support or special needs assistant support will be provided.</P>
      <P>My Department issued a detailed circular in 1999 advising schools of the arrangements governing staffing allocations for special needs children and the procedures to be followed by schools in seeking to access such support.</P>
      <P>The extent of this Government's commitment to children with special needs was reflected in its decision of October 1998 that all such children should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As a result of this decision, the number of resource teachers in place in the primary system has been increased from 104 to more than 950, and further posts are being allocated as needs are identified.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep these arrangements under review to ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require, irrespective of their level of need or location.</P>

      <P>Last October, I established a task force on the physical sciences under the chairmanship of Dr. Danny O'Hare, President Emeritus, Dublin City University. The purpose of this task force is to further support the promotion of the physical sciences at second and third levels. This promotion recognises that the development of the skills base in the area of the physical sciences has been identified as central to sustaining economic growth. The terms of reference of this task force include identification of the parameters affecting participation rates in the physical sciences and the identification of appropriate measures to redress this problem.</P>
      <P>The task force is comprised of a consultative group with some 40 members from a broad spectrum in education and industry. It has met on four occasions to date. Positions for two task force officers were advertised and appointments made from 1 March 2001 for one year. Two smaller working groups, each with less than ten members, were also established. One of these working groups is concentrating principally on second level issues and the other on third level-industrial issues. These working groups have met on five and six occasions, respectively.</P>
      <P>While the terms of reference of the task force require that there should be an emphasis on second level and third level education particularly, the second level working group is also attempting to take account of concerns at primary level.</P>
      <P>Both working groups will have further meetings this month and summaries of findings to date will be presented to the consultative group on 20 June. At that point, there should be a clear identification of the relevant issues and the next phase of the work of the task force will be to prioritise these and identify ways of addressing them. The task force has worked in a systematic and logical fashion and I look forward to its interim report and its assistance, as part of the range of initiatives already in place, in addressing participation rates in the physical sciences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 91, together.</P>
      <P>The practice of recent years, regarding income criteria, has been to increase the reckonable income limits, for the purpose of the grants schemes, in line with changes in the average industrial wage and to increase third level maintenance grants at least in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present-day third level students.</P>
      <P>This review, which is currently being carried out, is a wide-ranging review covering many topics. These include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, and student loans and taxation.</P>
      <P>Some of these topics are, by nature, complex and require detailed research. For example, costings of the effect of changes in the income limits below which applicants become eligible for a grant have been commissioned and carried out for the special review. However, I expect the review will be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>The number of third level grantholders in 1999-2000 was 45,534, which compares favourably with the total in 1995-96, which was 45,460. The cost of the four maintenance grant schemes in 2000 was £90.4 million, inclusive of fees paid under the higher education grants scheme and the VEC scholarships scheme. The estimated cost of the schemes for 2001 is £96.4 million.</P>
      <P>In considering the proportion of third level students receiving assistance from my Department, regard must be had both to the significant increase in the total numbers attending third level institutions and to the free tuition fees initiative, which was introduced in 1995-96. In 2000, expenditure on all student support, including free fees, amounted to just under £250 million. The equivalent cost for 2001 is likely to be in the order of £260 million.</P>
      <P>Any proposals for increasing expenditure under the maintenance grants schemes will take into account available resources and competing priorities within the education sector. Issues relating to the implementation of the project team's recommendations will, accordingly, be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

      <P>My Department has been engaged with the NCCA in an ongoing reform of the leaving certificate examination since the early 1990s. Syllabuses for the modern languages, Gaeilge, accounting, business, and music have been revised. The implementation of the revised syllabuses has, in each case, been supported by extensive in-service provision for teachers. A revised syllabus for leaving certificate English was examined for the first time this year. Revised syllabuses for physics and for chemistry will be examined for the first time in 2002 and revised syllabuses for home economics and biology will be implemented over the next few years. Revision of other syllabuses is nearing completion and they will be introduced on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>As well as revisions to the established leaving certificate, new and innovative leaving certificate options are now provided for students. The leaving certificate vocational programme caters for students who want a leaving certificate qualification that puts particular emphasis on the needs of the workplace. The leaving certificate applied is provided for students for whom the established leaving certificate is inappropriate. Revised leaving certificate applied syllabuses were implemented in the current school year.</P>
      <P>The NCCA has in place a senior cycle committee with representatives from my Department, teacher unions, school management organisations, third level education and of the world of work. The NCCA report referred to by the Deputy was a discussion document recently produced by this senior cycle committee as part of its work. When the NCCA deliberations are completed, comprehensive advice regarding the future shape of senior cycle, including leaving certificate options, will be presented for my consideration before I make a final decision on the matter.</P>

The figures shown are for Youthreach in the education sector only. The funding role for payment of training allowances for Youthreach participants in the VEC sector transferred from FÁS to my Department with effect from 6 April 1998. The figures exclude some 800 places in a network of senior Traveller training centres which caters for Travellers, both young people and adults in a culturally supportive environment. The cost of this programme is estimated at £9.01 million in 2001. Responsibility for the Traveller training centre network, which had been funded jointly by FÁS and the Department of Education up to 1998, was transferred entirely to the VEC sector with effect from 6 April 1998.</P>
    <P>Following the mid-term review of EU Structural Funds in 1998, a major expansion of places under Youthreach was agreed, increasing provision in FÁS and the vocational education committees. The expansion was designed to address a critical shortfall in places and to increase opportunities for participants to progress to further education and training after the foundation stage of the programme. It was complemented by the provision for the first time of a guidance, counselling and psychological service measure, and by childcare provision within the VEC sector.</P>
    <P>This expansion happened side by side with a dramatic improvement in the economy and a rapid fall in overall unemployment. As a result, providers are having difficulty in filling places, and are faced with a move from Youthreach into employment as job opportunities increase. Based on feedback from centres, there would appear to be no need at present for an increase in Youthreach full-time places nationally.</P>
    <P>However, it is intended that under the Back to Education initiative, set out in the national development plan, there will be an expansion of part-time education options under VTOS, Youthreach and PLC programmes, particularly aimed at those with less than upper secondary education. This will enable existing full-time places to be redeployed to part-time mode where appropriate. A major focus of this initiative will facilitate part-time and more flexible options within Youthreach so as to enable those who <Col N="1202" /> leave the programme mid-way to enter employment to continue their education on a part-time basis to gain qualifications. This will also enable education, employment and family responsibilities to be combined, and help Youthreach to cater more effectively for lone parents.</P>

      <Quest>the educational services available to children suffering from attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; the number of children affected; and the funding provided in 2001 for such services.</Quest>

      <P>Many children suffering from attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and/or special needs assistant services.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, the Government decided that all children with special needs, including children suffering from the conditions to which the Deputy refers, should henceforth be entitled to an automatic response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting such children has grown from 104 to more than 950. The number of special needs assistants has grown from less than 300 to more than 2,000 over the same period. Additional resources of this kind are being deployed on an ongoing basis as further needs are identified.</P>
      <P>Where the level of the disorder in question is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special classes in special schools or attached to ordinary primary schools. All such facilities operate at a pupil-teacher ratio of 8:1 and children attending such classes attract a special rate of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>Precise details of the number of children affected by attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are not available to my Department.</P>
      <P>The annual salary cost of the resource teacher service is approximately £23.75 million. The annual salary cost of the special needs assistants' service is approximately £30 million. Both resource teachers and special needs assistants can be deployed to cater for a number of children with a range of special needs, including the conditions to which the Deputy refers. It is not, therefore, possible to identify the element of overall costs that relates specifically to children with the conditions in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically, this can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with schools involving my Department's inspectorate, to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school, or alternatively, his or her placement in another school. In more difficult situations the national educational psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>While these measures provide protections for students, I have brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act to address general issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second-level schools. The Act requires schools to report suspensions that last at least six days to their local educational welfare officer. Schools will also be required to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances, the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try and identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>

      <P>The Educational Research Centre has undertaken two comprehensive studies of the extent of non-completion in universities and in institutes of technology, which provide analyses of data on non-completion by institution, gender and field of study. The Dublin Institute of Technology is also conducting a two-year quantitative and qualitative investigation of student withdrawal within the institute.</P>
      <P>At my request, the Higher Education Authority recently hosted a national seminar on course completion in higher education. This seminar provided an opportunity to consider the issues and trends arising from the recent studies against international experience and from the students' perspective. The need for qualitative research to be undertaken into the factors influencing non-completion was highlighted at the seminar and the Educational Research Centre is undertaking qualitative research to identify the underlying causes of non-completion with a view to developing appropriate strategies to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, strategies and measures to tackle non-completion have been put in place both at national and institutional level. In the university sector, the Higher Education Authority allocated £400,000 in 2000 for specific initiatives to enhance retention rates, with further funding committed for the ongoing support of these initiatives in 2001 and 2002. These initiatives include measures to track students, development of mentoring and study skills programmes, counselling services for new entrants and information packs for schools. Other initiatives developed by universities include orientation programmes, life skills modules and the appointment of academic counsellors, access officers, school liaison officers and mature students' officers. The quantitative study undertaken by the Educational Research Centre recommended that each university develop explicit policies on retention. I have asked the Higher Education Authority to review these policies within 12 months.</P>
      <P>In the institute of technology sector, the council of directors has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on &ldquo;maximising success rates&rdquo; for students. The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector and the profile has been made available to all the institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, a two year allocation of £1.5 million was provided for the technological sector to address the area of non-completion. This funding has supported the appointment of retention officers; schools liaison officers; provision of additional advisory services including counselling, <Col N="1205" /> academic support and career guidance; establishment of staff training seminars, upgrading of orientation programmes and the expansion of mentoring programmes.</P>
    <P>Considerable work is also being undertaken in collaboration with the National Centre for Guidance in Education and with my Department's inspectorate to develop other positive actions in this area.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a wide-ranging response and confirm my commitment to prioritising the issue of non-completion in third level education. Completion of the qualitative research now being undertaken will enable more precise identification of the underlying causes of non-completion and the development of appropriate strategies.</P>

      <P>Funding of schools at primary and second level is structured on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants towards services such as caretaking and secretarial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has placed a high priority on increasing funding to schools. Recent developments at primary level include significant <Col N="1206" /> improvement in the level of capitation grants. I increased the standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools from £45 per pupil to £75.50 in the current school year, and a rate of £80 will apply in the 2001-02 school year.</P>
    <P>At second level, I increased the <i>per capita</i> grant by £8 from September last and I will further increase the grant by £10 to £202 for the next school year. In addition, schools with disadvantaged status receive further capitation of £30 per pupil per year, bringing the overall <i>per capita</i> payment in respect of such pupils to £232.</P>
    <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the Giving Children an Even Break programme, together with the improvements in the overall pupil teacher ratio in recent years and the additional funding provision for schools, are measures which will assist teachers in areas of disadvantage. I launched the programme in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme involves the creation of over 200 new teacher posts and will cost £26 million over a three-year period. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>Rural schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be allocated the services of a teacher-co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Rural schools that could not be clustered with other similar schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to teacher-co-ordinator support.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of criticism by the education partners of my Department's provision for non-national pupils. On the contrary, appreciation has been expressed of the support being provided by my Department. This support operates at a number of levels. All non-national pupils are included in establishing the staffing entitlement of a school. In addition, every school which has 14 or more non-national pupils enrolled, who have significant English language deficits, is entitled to appoint an additional full-time teacher to provide English language support for these pupils. Where there are 28 such pupils enrolled, a second teacher is sanctioned. Where smaller numbers of non-national pupils are enrolled, support is given by means of a grant in the case of primary school pupils. This grant is either £5,000 or £7,500. A grant of £5,000 is paid to primary schools where there are as few as three such pupils enrolled. At second level, support is given by way of extra hours, starting with three hours for a school with a single non-national pupil. This increases on a gradual basis up to 22 hours for 14 pupils and this entitles the school to a full-time teacher. An initial grant of £500 is paid in all cases where a full-time teacher is sanctioned with a top-up grant of £250 in each succeeding year. This is to help provide any additional specific teaching materials that may be needed. Where additional accommodation is required as a result of enrolling non-national pupils, all costs of such provision will be funded by the Department, including site works and furniture. Further support is provided by the refugee language support unit. This unit was set up under the aegis of Trinity College, Dublin, and is funded by my Department. It provides teaching materials, training and <Col N="1210" /> ongoing support to teachers catering for the English language needs of non-national pupils.</P>

      <P>At second level, I have provided for an additional 1,000 posts to be created in the current school year. A proportion of these posts have been utilised to facilitate the reduction in the <Col N="1211" /> pupil-teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1. The rest have been targeted at particular programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the junior certificate school programme and the Stay-in-School retention initiative.</P>
      <P>Since the Government came into office, the pupil-teacher ratio at second level has been reduced from approximately 16:1 to under 15:1 in the current year.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an additional 200 posts will be created at second level in each of the next two years. This increase in posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio in the sector.</P>
      <P>At primary level, 350 new teaching posts are allocated for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, a further 45 posts that arose from the retention of the demographic dividend are also allocated for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>I expect that the overall parent-teacher ratio for the 2001-02 school year for primary schools will be 19.2:1. This compares with an overall parent-teacher ratio of 22.1:1 in the 1996-97 school year.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is proposed to appoint an additional 550 primary teachers between the 2002-03 and 2003-04 school years, which will lower the ratio further.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for a national educational psychological service recommended in September 1998 that the Minister for Education and Science should establish a National Educational Psychological Service as an executive agency of the Department. The report also recommended that the agency would have an overall target number of 200 psychologists and that this target should be achieved over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time-consuming nature of such competitions, there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of the school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this year. This will rise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the NEPS service before the end of the school year 2003-04 and that most will have access well before that time.</P>
      <P>The planning group for NEPS examined estimated levels of demand for psychological intervention as well as psychologist-student ratios in other countries. Ratios elsewhere generally vary between one psychologist to 3,000 students and one psychologist to 5,000 students. The exact ratio depends upon the needs of each particular area. At present, NEPS is working towards an overall ratio of one psychologist to 5,000 students but this will allow for variation from area to area, depending upon level of disadvantage, incidence of special needs etc.</P>
      <P>The planning group emphasised that there was no exact way of quantifying the number of psychologists that would ultimately be needed and that the experience of the developing Service would provide a basis for future reviews. Since it published its report, there have been considerable changes in the educational system, particularly in relation to provision for special educational needs. The management committee of NEPS has therefore decided to commission a review of the staffing needs of the agency in the light of recent developments and will report to me in due course.</P>

      <P>The total number of applications received in my Department under the Freedom of Information Act from 21 April 1998, the date of commencement of the Act to 31 May 2001 was 2,140.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that there have been some difficulties in the response times in freedom of information requests made to my Department. My Department has recently put in place new measures to assess the times taken for response for all freedom of information requests to ensure that requests are answered in accordance with the Act.</P>
      <P>However, significant difficulties have been experienced in replying to one particular category of requests. The reason for the higher than average number of freedom of information requests received by my Department relates to the very large number of requests, 1,552 or 72% of the total received from former residents of industrial-reformatory schools who are seeking copies of records relating to their time in industrial or reformatory schools.</P>
      <P>I am strongly committed to the full release of all personal information to the former residents of the institutions. However, I am concerned that delays have been and continue to be experienced in dealing with these requests. To some extent this is due to the large number of requests being received. It also reflects difficulties in applying the very formal procedures of the Freedom of Information Act to the release of what can be very sensitive personal records.</P>
      <P>My Department has a number of options to address these problems: a computerisation project &ndash; a process which will put all of the records on a computer format to allow for their speedy retrieval to facilitate faster release of records; allocation of staff resources &ndash; significant additional staff have been allocated to the section dealing with freedom of information requests in this area; Barnardos project &ndash; the Department is in the final stages of an agreement with Barnardos to allow for the release of personal records through that agency in a much quicker and more sensitive manner to the one making the request.</P>

      <P>Under the third level student support schemes administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees under the aegis of my Department, means-tested maintenance grants are payable to eligible students at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. For 2000-01, the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £710, respectively.</P>
      <P>The revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training is funded by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>An increase in the current average annual grant payment to £3,500 would cost an estimated £88 million or about double the current annual expenditure on third level student maintenance grants. Such an increase could only be considered in the light of available resources and other priorities in the education sector.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to third level students through the student assistance/access fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students who, due to their financial circumstances, might be unable to continue their third level studies. I increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>

In addition, extra remuneration is being offered to principals of participating schools in respect of the preparatory work involved in developing July programmes. Schools participating in the programme will also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of participating children, amounting to 1.5 times the normal monthly capitation rate for children with autism. Funding is also available for transport arrangements for participating children.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have already advised the INTO and the National Association of Boards of Management of the above arrangements. My Department will be in contact with all relevant schools in relation to this matter in the next few days.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006 to tackle under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last September, I appointed an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to <Col N="1218" /> promote access by students from the three target groups. The group was asked to advise on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area. I have received the group's report and I am considering its detailed recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have announced a range of initiatives aimed at increasing participation rates among pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. As an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced last September the introduction of a special maintenance grant, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>The action group's report contains recommendations on the eligibility criteria governing the category of students who should qualify for the special rate of grant. My Department is finalising the administrative arrangements necessary to ensure that the special rates of maintenance grant will be made available without delay.</P>
    <P>I also announced the introduction of a new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of £1 million in 2001, which will be administered in conjunction with the area partnerships.</P>
    <P>I have increased significantly the provision for the student assistance-access fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>Last November, I announced the establishment of a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of third level students. The review will cover a wide range of issues, including the level of grant and eligibility and income limits.</P>
    <P>Two reports undertaken by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, quantify the extent of non-completion at third level by institution, gender and field of study. In response to recommendations in these reports, further comprehensive research is being undertaken to examine the underlying causes of non-completion, including the possible impact of social background and financial circumstances. The findings of this qualitative research will influence future policy initiatives regarding non-completion, including initiatives in the area of financial support for students.</P>

      <P>My Department does not provide direct financial assistance for the provision of student accommodation and, therefore, does not directly monitor the costs of on-campus student accommodation and other student accommodation.</P>
      <P>This Government has introduced tax incentives to encourage the provision of student-rented residential accommodation in section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>As a result of these tax incentives, 2,260 bed spaces have already been created. A further 14,523 are due for completion under this scheme. The tax incentive is available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003. Therefore, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students.</P>
      <P>This review, which in progress, is a wide-ranging review covering many topics, including accommodation needs. Issues relating to the implementation of the project team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement in the provision of education services for children with special needs of pre-school age is currently confined to a small number of pre-school classes catering for children with autism. Details of the level of demand for pre-school places generally for children with special needs are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on early childhood education sets out a blueprint for the development of the pre-school sector over the period 2000 to 2006, including developments in relation to provision for children with special needs. With a view to implementation of the White Paper, my Department has sought and received proposals from third level institutions for a pilot project to develop and co-ordinate early childhood education provision in pursuance of the objectives in the White Paper. Discussions with the institutions concerned are well advanced and I expect to be in a position to announce details of the project in the near future.</P>
      <P>However, in advance of the above developments I recently announced proposals for the introduction of a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism. My Department is currently engaged in developing proposals for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1998, the Government decided that all children with special needs in primary schools should henceforth have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting special needs children in integrated <Col N="1221" /> settings has increased from 104 to more than 950. The number of special needs assistants supporting special needs children in primary schools has increased from less than 300 to more than 2000 over the same period.</P>
    <P>Where children suffer from more serious disabilities, provision can be made in one of a range of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary primary school. There are more than 100 special schools and approximately 400 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools. All such facilities are dedicated to particular disability groups and all operate at special reduced pupil-teacher ratios.</P>
    <P>The major development of special education services undertaken by this Government will ensure that all children with special needs in primary schools have access to the support they require. I assure the Deputy that I intend to continue to build on these developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 568 and 580 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding this issue. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as community employment schemes in schools are phased out, funding equiv<Col N="1222" /> alent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of a transfer of funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department would be to remove the anomalies that exist in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools. For instance, certain schools currently have the benefit of secretarial and caretaking services under CE schemes and also receive a grant for such services from my Department, whereas other schools are solely dependent on the grants that are issued by my Department. The purpose of the discussions that are taking place is to transfer full responsibility for the funding of schools for secretarial and caretaking services to my Department, which would ensure a uniform and equitable system of funding for such services.</P>
    <P>The transfer of such moneys to my Department will result in very significant improvements in secretarial and caretaking assistance for all schools. The discussions are at an advanced stage and a further announcement will be made regarding this matter in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the most recent data on school drop out at junior cycle and senior cycle; the analysis which his Department has carried out into the concentration of this problem; the postal districts most affected; and the specific proposals he has for tackling this problem.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 ESRI early school leavers survey of 1996-97 leavers indicates that about 81% of students currently complete second level education. Of these, 96.5% complete junior cycle and 3.5% leave with no qualifications, while a further 15.5% leave school after junior cycle but before completing senior cycle. In addition, it is estimated that some 824 pupils do not transfer from primary to second level school.</P>
      <P>When account is taken of a range of factors such as inter-school transfer, these data are broadly in line with my Department's analysis in this area, which indicates a completion rate of some 83% for all pupils who entered first year of junior cycle some five to six years ago. Some 94% of students sit the junior certificate examination. The data are not available by postal district.</P>
      <P>Given the vital significance of school completion for the life chances of our young people, I am very conscious of continuing to press for improvements in the numbers completing second level. As the Deputy will be aware, this is a complex and difficult issue with no easy solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The correct approach is to advance on a number of fronts. First, we must ensure that there is a proper legislative underpinning to school attendance. I see the recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act and the newly established National Educational Welfare Board achieving this. We <Col N="1223" /> must also ensure that the curriculum provided in our second level schools meets the needs of all pupils. The leaving certificate applied and junior certificate schools programme are examples of measures which are making a real impact.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that we assist schools in a focused manner in dealing with the problem of early school leaving. For that reason, strategies are in place to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard, the eight to 15-year-old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 1998. One of its key objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. The initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 and has since been extended for a further phase up to 31 August 2002. At present, I am considering the expansion of the initiative to additional schools and areas which have the most severe problems with retaining pupils to the completion of senior cycle.</P>
    <P>In June 1999, the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding is allocated to targeted schools on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. This initiative was extended by a further 59 schools in June 2000. The selection of schools was based on an objective analysis of their retention rates. Accordingly, schools with the most significant difficulties were invited to participate in the initiative. This has allowed resources to be targeted at schools through which they would reach the greatest number of young people at risk.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives such as the new programme &ndash; giving children an even break at primary level, the disadvantaged areas scheme and the home-school-community liaison scheme, which cover both primary and second levels, are targeted at the most disadvantaged areas and are designed to encourage pupil retention and assist young people realise their potential through participation in education.</P>

      <P>The report of the steering group on basic income was made available to the social partners on 2 March last and placed in the Oireachtas Library at the same time.</P>
      <P>The steering group's task was to undertake an appraisal of the concept and full implications of introducing a basic income payment to all citizens. It was not its role to reach a conclusion or make recommendations about basic income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The group's view was that the studies represent a significant move forward in our understanding of the complex issues involved. These need to be teased out in detail and the intention is to publish a Green Paper on basic income later this year.</P>
    <P>The report of the steering group has been made available to the social partners and their views will be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>The complexity and range of issues to be considered in taking forward the proposal for a basic income mean that a number of Departments will be involved in the preparation of the Green Paper. At the moment, my Department is in contact with the relevant Departments with a view to agreeing arrangements for the preparation of a Green Paper.</P>

      <Quest> the plans the Government has, in the context of declining unemployment particularly in the greater Dublin area, to introduce changes in the community employment schemes run by FÁS; the implications such changes, including mainstreaming, will have for community centres employing personnel on such schemes; the implications changes may have for scheme participants; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Community employment is a work experience programme whose primary role is to assist the progression of participants into jobs and-or further education and training. FÁS has operational responsibility for the delivery of the programme, which has currently approximately 33,500 participants. Following the Government's decision in July 1999 to restructure the programme, the numbers on community employment schemes will reduce to 28,000 by the end of 2003. In this context, it is necessary for FÁS to prioritise projects according to needs. Priority is currently given to &ldquo;caring/support&rdquo; projects based in the community and voluntary sector, including child care, care of the elderly and disabled persons, and drugs task force projects.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, consultations are currently taking place with relevant Departments to progress the mainstreaming of certain essential services. This process involves the transfer of community employment funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for the services in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that mainstreaming will take place on a phased basis having regard to the suitability for mainstreaming of the service being provided, and with due regard to an individual's <Col N="1230" /> participation entitlements on community employment. Mainstreaming should enhance the services being provided and provide employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>My Department is finalising proposals for a new high supports process, which will be targeted particularly at participants on the jobs initiative programme and other long-term unemployed persons who find it difficult to progress to open labour market employment due to age, health or literacy or numeracy factors. Further consultations with the social partners on the high supports process are due to take place shortly and I hope this process can be put in place at an early date.</P>

      <Quest> if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 103 of 29 May 2001, she will outline all the exceptional circumstances where arrangements are made to extend the period on community employment schemes beyond three years; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The current arrangements for participation on community employment allow for three years total participation on the programme. Residents of the offshore islands and participants on drugs task force projects are exempted from this rule. In addition, as indicated in my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 103 of 29 May 2001, short duration extensions may be permitted where people are awaiting commencement of a training course or a job.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any specific breach in these guidelines, I will have this brought to the attention of FÁS with a view to its putting the procedure in place in the specific case in question.</P>

      <Quest> the plans she has to ensure work is available for those on the live register in Counties Monaghan and Cavan; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of jobs in any particular area is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one for which I as Minister would have a direct responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, through the enterprise development agencies, is committed to ensuring an equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. The Border, Midlands and West (BMW) region, which includes Counties Monaghan and Cavan, is a priority area for employment promotion for the agencies concerned &ndash;<Col N="1231" /> IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; which promote overseas industry and indigenous industry, respectively.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has refocused its strategy with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the BMW region in the coming years. To ensure this objective is achieved, IDA Ireland has re-organised its internal structures and allocated additional staff to its regional offices and opened a new regional office in Cavan. Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on the marketing of the regions for specific sectors and the improvement of marketing material for the regions. IDA Ireland's incentive package is also strongly geared in favour of the BMW region.</P>
    <P>In Cavan, following intensive marketing by IDA Ireland of the 25,000-square-feet advance factory in the IDA business park, Teradyne Inc. announced in November 2000 its intention to establish a manufacturing plant in Cavan. The company plans to invest £50 million in a technology business campus and create 740 jobs within five years.</P>
    <P>The IDA is also firmly focused on County Monaghan, with an intensive marketing programme under way for the area. A modern quality business park has been planned for the 30-acre land bank at Knockaconny on the outskirts of Monaghan town. This initiative includes an immediate commitment to invest £100,000 in enhancing and upgrading the site to meet the needs of foreign direct investment. The IDA has been granted planning permission to construct a 25,000-square-feet advance building capable of accommodating e-business or state-of-the-art manufacturing projects. Tenders for the construction of the building are being processed and the IDA is in discussion with developers with a view to commencing construction by September of this year. The authority has also provided a site at Knockaconny for the development of the Armagh-Monaghan digital corridor initiative. Contracts have been signed for the construction of a 20,0000-square-feet high-quality incubation building, which will provide work space for the information technology and knowledge-intensive industry.</P>
    <P>For its part, Enterprise Ireland is addressing the development needs of its client companies in the north east region. To this end, it has taken action across a range of initiatives. These include working directly with individual companies, working at a sectoral level with groups of companies, and working to encourage the development of new start up enterprises.</P>
    <P>The north east regional office of Enterprise Ireland works closely with the community groups within Cavan and Monaghan to assist, by way of funding, the building of enterprise centres. At present, three enterprise centres have been completed in Monaghan and two are in the course of construction, with the Farnham Innovation and Technology Centre in Cavan town near completion, bringing the number of enterprise centres <Col N="1232" /> assisted by Enterprise Ireland in County Cavan to seven.</P>
    <P>The Monaghan and Cavan county enterprise boards, which last year supported projects that provided 149 and 61 full-time jobs, respectively, will continue to assist job-creating enterprises through the provision of capital, employment and feasibility study grants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 134, 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>Supervisors are employed by sponsors of community employment, CE, projects and these positions are funded by a grant from FÁS. The personnel concerned are not FÁS employees. Supervisors are afforded the same rights and protection under the employment Acts as other workers in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Department of Education and Science with regard to the mainstreaming of schools' services are at an advanced stage and I intend to begin the mainstreaming process and to transfer CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to that Department in time for the new school year in September next. CE participants providing schools' services, which include secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants, will not be replaced on the programme when their term has finished as it will no longer be possible for schools to avail of CE to provide these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is likely, therefore, that there will be some redundancies among supervisors as participant levels on projects are reduced. However, every effort will be made to provide alternative employ<Col N="1233" /> ment on other CE projects as vacancies arise. In addition, there may also be employment opportunities in social economy enterprises as this programme is rolled out.</P>
    <P>The matter of redundancy payments to supervisors is being considered in the overall context of the mainstreaming of CE essential services. Current arrangements allow for FÁS funding for statutory redundancy payments only, in cases where it is clear that sponsors are unable to meet these costs. I hope to make a further statement regarding the mainstreaming of schools' services in the near future.</P>

      <P>EU legislation opened EU markets, including the Irish market, to competition from insurance providers based throughout the EU, in Ireland 1994. Currently, there are 27 insurers authorised to underwrite motor insurance in Ireland. Fifteen companies have their headquarters in Ireland, 11 are based in other EU member states and one is a non-EU insurer. In addition, I have removed the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on brokers' commission in an effort to encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>As a result of differing assessments of claims histories by insurers, strategies towards niche markets, specialisation and segmentation of the market, motor insurers quote different premiums for similar risks and this is characteristic of a competitive market. It is desirable that there should be greater transparency in the underwriting and pricing of motor insurance. However, it should be remembered that these are issues upon which insurance companies make decisions and EU law prohibits us from intervening in the pricing and underwriting of insurance in this country.</P>
      <P>The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers, including the relationship between claims and premiums, is being examined by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The board's final report is expected by the end of this year and its recommendations are awaited with great interest. In the light of those recommendations, I will consider what further action is appropriate towards the goal of the reduction of the cost of motor insurance.</P>

These discussions are aimed at ensuring that, as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to that Department.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these discussions is to transfer full responsibility for the funding of ancillary services in schools, such as secretarial and caretaking assistance, to that Department, which would ensure a uniform and equitable system of funding for such services. I anticipate that the transfer of CE funding for schools can begin in time for the new school year in September next.

      <P>The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991, provide that if an employee has been in continuous service with the same employer for at least 13 weeks and is normally expected to work at least eight hours a week, she-he is entitled to a minimum period of notice before the employer may dismiss him-her.</P>
      <P>In general, the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993, protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs and provide redress for employees who have been found to be unfairly dismissed. To qualify under the Acts, an employee is normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and have at least one year's continuous service. It would appear from the details supplied as to length of service that the person concerned would not qualify under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. However, if she feels that she has been unfairly dismissed, she may refer the matter to a rights commissioner of the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. A rights commissioner investigation is, however, voluntary and requires the consent of both parties.</P>
      <P>More detailed information on the unfair dismissals legislation and copies of the relevant application form for bringing a claim to the rights commissioner may be obtained by contacting the employment rights information unit of my Department at 65a Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, or by telephoning the unit at (01) 631 3131 or Lo-call 1890 220222 where staff would be happy to assist.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of this Department to process all applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. Assuming that an application has been completed correctly and is otherwise in order, it should take approximately seven weeks to process from date of receipt.</P>

The number has increased from an average of 600 per week at the end of 2000 to an average of 1,000 per week currently.

      <P>Strong economic and employment growth means that there are plenty of employment opportunities for all who are in a position to avail of them. For its part the Government is pursuing a range of policies, including fiscal policies, which assist in improving the reward for work, including that of older persons. Training is just one of the elements that may encourage older persons to remain in or return to the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS plays a substantial role in direct training and retraining to meet the labour and skills needs of the economy and to integrate people into the <Col N="1237" /> workforce. FÁS has in place a large range and scale of training programmes both for persons in, or returning to, employment, including training programmes targeted at the unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. FÁS programmes do not discriminate on the basis of age or gender but are designed to match jobseekers with available opportunities.</P>
    <P>This year's estimate for training for people in employment amounts to almost £70 million, which includes grants to employers for adapting and upskilling their workforce. FÁS also has an extensive range and scale of training programmes targeted at the unemployed, including specific skills training, traineeships and local enterprise training. Total FÁS funding provision this year for training for the unemployed amounts to just over £120 million.</P>
    <P>As part of further initiatives in this area, I have asked FÁS to examine if there are specific steps that can be taken to afford older persons the appropriate opportunities to take up suitable vacancies.</P>

      <P>In general my Department is prepared to issue work permits for the employment in the State of non-European economic area, EEA, nationals in the State where an employer can demonstrate that, despite prior attempts, they have been unable to recruit a suitable Irish or other EEA national for the job(s) concerned. Employers must comply with all relevant labour law requirements in respect of the job concerned, for example, minimum wage levels, maximum hours of work permitted, etc.</P>
      <P>A new application form for work permits, recently introduced, makes specific reference to the protection afforded to employees by Irish employment rights legislation. This must be brought to the attention of the prospective employee by the employer. The new form requires the signature of the employee, the employer and of any recruitment agent, where applicable. Also, on my initiative last year, the Government introduced a new simplified work visa-authorisation scheme to facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified people from outside the EEA for designated sectors of the employment market where skill shortages are particularly acute, for example, for particular posts in the IT and construction sector and for registered nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the relevant immigration requirements must be satisfied in relation to the non-<Col N="1238" /> national in respect of whom the permit is being sought.

      <P>Strong economic and employment growth has resulted in substantial decline in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. Based on the most recent quarterly national household survey, for the first quarter of 2001, the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7%, down from 4.7% one year earlier.</P>
      <P>There were 65,600 persons unemployed in the first quarter of 2001, an annual fall of nearly 16,000. Of that total, there are now just over 21,000 persons who are long-term unemployed based on the ILO measure. The fiscal and job creation policies pursued by the Government in recent years have contributed to an overall reduction of 93,000 in the numbers unemployed since April 1997. Nevertheless, there will always be an element of short-term unemployment in the economy. These persons represent a pool of unemployed who remain for short periods in unemployment pending their transition to a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For persons who are long-term unemployed, studies indicate that such persons face multiple barriers to taking up work, for example, a lack of education and skills, misuse of drugs, literacy problems or age barriers. The Government has in place a range of measures aimed at tackling remaining levels of unemployment. The preventative strategy under the employment action plan represents a fundamental approach aimed at intervening with persons at an early stage of unemployment &ndash; before six months for young persons and before nine months for adult unemployed &ndash; to offer such persons a job or other employability support in their transition to a job. This strategy has been very successful in the num<Col N="1239" /> bers of persons supported and who have subsequently left the live register.</P>
    <P>For persons who become long-term unemployed, there is in place a range of programmes to assist in their transition to employment. These include a range of FÁS training and retraining programmes and work experience such as community employment. In addition, there are programmes in place which are the responsibility of other Departments such as the back to work allowance scheme and the vocational education and training opportunities scheme.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing petroleum developments is the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960. The provisions of this Act relating to the environmental support assessment require the applicant seeking approval for the working of petroleum to submit an environmental impact statement, EIS, to me for consideration. This EIS must accompany the plan of development for the field. Both the plan of development and the EIS require my approval before the applicant can engage in any development work leading to or associated with the extraction of gas.</P>
      <P>Among the issues that fall to be addressed by the environmental impact statement are the effects of the proposed development on human beings, including the long-term risks, if any, to health and the environment. It will also have to address the environmental sensitivity of the geographical area likely to be affected having regard in particular to existing land use. Before reaching a decision on a project of this nature, my Department will carry out an extensive consultative process with both internal and external experts, statutory consultees and the general public on the environmental impact statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also engaged Environmental Resource Management, ERM, to advise on the environmental impact statement submission by Enterprise Energy Ireland. This advice is for the purpose of determining if the EIS conforms with statutory requirements, to advise on its adequacy and to ascertain the likelihood of significant impacts arising from the proposed activities. The environmental statement will be available for inspection by the public as soon as the plan of development is formally submitted to me and a notice published by Enterprise Energy <Col N="1240" /> Ireland to this effect. The public is entitled to make submissions or observations to me in relation to the effects on the environment of the proposed development.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact statement and the observations-submissions thereon will then be rigorously examined by my Department in consultation with the relevant State agencies and the prescribed bodies, An Taisce, Dúchas and Mayo County Council. When this process has been completed I will be in a position to make a decision on the proposed development.</P>

      <Quest>the monetary benefits which will accrue as a result of the Corrib Gas Field; and the benefit it will bring to the people of north Mayo.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current fiscal terms for exploration and exploitation of petroleum offshore Ireland are governed by the provisions pertaining to petroleum contained in the Finance Act, 1992. Under this Act, corporation tax at a rate of 25% will apply to profits from gas production under the petroleum lease for the Corrib field. The corporation tax will be payable after the deduction of allowances. These allowances relate to capital and operating expenditure and abandonment costs for the field. In addition, exploration costs are also deductible, which need not necessarily be field related, provided they have been incurred in the 25 year period immediately prior to the commencement of field production. The corporation tax accruing will depend on a number of factors, including those referred to above, and the amount and price of the gas sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> The benefits to the people of north Mayo will include employment during the construction phase of the development and permanent employment at the terminal when it becomes operational. It is understood that up to 500 persons will be employed during the construction phrase and up to 50 persons permanently at the terminal when it becomes operational. Enterprise Energy Ireland anticipates that Irish contractors and suppliers will feature prominently in the terminal construction team. It is anticipated that the development will also provide more localised benefits for the duration of the construction period. These include increased trade for local shops, service industries and accommodation providers as well as indirect employment.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary pipeline infrastructure is in place to bring gas to customers, both domestic and commercial, in the west. I understand that Bord Gáis is at present considering the feasibility of making gas available to towns in the west and north of the country. The existence of this infrastructure should make the western region more attractive to inward investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1999 it was agreed in principle that the current responsibility of the Irish Coast Guard for marine emergencies be extended to encompass emergencies occurring in inland rivers, lakes and waterways. My Department is currently engaging in consultation with other State agencies and local interests with a view to developing, costing and implementing the necessary planning, communications and operational infrastructure to bring inland emergency response up to the current high standards of marine emergency response. This work is ongoing.</P>
      <P>At present, the Irish Coast Guard provides members of the Community Inshore Rescue Service, CIRS, with a grant-in-aid of £2,500 per annum along with training courses, safety inspections-audits and standard operational procedures, provided they comply with certain criteria set down for such rescue groups. At present membership of the CIRS is comprised of coastal response organisations. However, consideration is being given to enlarging the CIRS on foot of the Government decision on the Irish Coast Guard's extended responsibility. I am arranging for my Department to send the Deputy a copy of the Irish water safety booklet entitled, Guidelines for the Establishment of Community Inshore Rescue Stations in Ireland, for his information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is currently no fund available to support groups such as Carrick-on-Suir River Rescue Group, other than the ongoing grant-in-aid men<Col N="1242" /> tioned above. I have asked my Department to consider setting up such a fund. However, in the meantime the Deputy should examine the above mentioned booklet with a view to assessing how and/or whether he would wish to apply to join the CIRS. I will revert to the Deputy as soon as possible in relation to the question of a fund and any relevant qualifying requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 128 on 1 May 2001 in which I confirmed that I am aware that reports are received from time to time regarding excessive predation on fish stocks by cormorants. However, the extent of the damage to these stocks has not been quantified with precision. In the case of salmon stocks it is thought that cormorants may prey significantly on migrating salmon smolts. In this regard, I have asked the national salmon commission for analysis and advice in relation to predation in general on the salmon species.</P>
      <P>Cormorants are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 which provides that they may not be hunted save under licence issued by the Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands. Such a licence may be issued where the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is satisfied that damage is being done to a fishery by cormorants. I am informed by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands that 11 such licences were issued during 2000.</P>

Residual stocks of products containing lindane were largely used up during 1999 and such products have not been used since then. Any remaining stocks are being disposed of in accordance with the governing regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, 58.4 million or £46 million, 45.7 million or £36 million under the southern and eastern regional operational programme and 12.7 million or £10 million under the Border, midland and western regional operational programme has been allocated for investment in the commercial seaports sector. In broad terms this funding will be available under two sub-measures for, first, investment in new infrastructure; upgrading existing infrastructure; improvement of capacity utilisation; development and strengthening of intermodal connections; and, second, providing assistance for those regional ports and harbours which will disengage from commercial cargo-transport activities by assisting the transition to alternative uses.</P>
      <P>These sub-measures will between them maximise the use of existing facilities and infrastructure and ensure sufficient new infrastructure is added as demand grows. The specific objectives of the measure are to: address capacity deficiencies identified particularly in the ro-ro and lo-lo sectors which would inhibit growth over the period of the plan; ensure adequate port facilities are available in regional ports to handle trade in their natural hinterlands thereby supporting local industries dependent on them and contributing towards a more balanced geographical distribution of economic activity; maximise the use of existing assets by removing institutional constraints and by the application of information technology with the capability of increasing the effective capacity of existing facilities; co-ordinate port investments with intermodal investments under non-port measures; continue the trend of reductions in port charges in order to improve the productivity and competitiveness of ports and of industries dependent on ports; keep to a minimum the additional costs, including externalities, which port operations give rise to, for example, congestion and environmental impacts generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for funding have been invited from promoters of seaports investment projects in the public and private sector and the closing date for receipt of proposals is 18 June, 2001. <Col N="1244" /> Applications for funding will follow departmental guidelines for promoters of seaport investment projects and provide detailed project description and project rationale. Projects will be analysed, by independent consultants commissioned by my Department, against rigorous economic, financial and operational criteria.</P>
    <P>Project selection criteria will include the following: contribution of project to the measure objectives; financial viability and commercial appraisal, as appropriate; previous investment experience; complementarity with other measures-programmes; impact on competition-levels of service and charges in the port sector; impact on the environment; contribution to regional development; impact on equality &ndash; project promoters at a minimum must compile gender disaggregated statistics appropriate to the project concerned.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Port of Waterford Company has been statutorily responsible under the Harbours Act, 1996 for the management, control, operation and development of the port as a commercial State company since it was corporatised on the 11 January 1999. The Port of Waterford Company is currently finalising a detailed application for funding under the national development plan for a wide range of infrastructural and development projects. The projects will contribute to the overall improvement and enhancement of the facilities at the port.</P>
    <P>My Department has been advised by the company that the developments proposed will include lo-lo, ro-ro, bulk and storage facilities, a bulk liquids terminal, port access improvements as well as a conservancy vessel and enhanced safety management systems.</P>

      <P>Under the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations, 2000 &ndash; S.I. No. 256 of 2000, provision is made in law for the issue of tags to holders of salmon rod, commercial fishing and dealer's licences. In the case of rod licence holders, tags are made available in lots of five except in the case of one day licence holders to whom tags are made available in lots of three. In the case of commercial licence holders, the regulations provide for an initial issue of a number of tags which is equivalent to at least 50% of the licence holder's last annual catch. The regulations also provide for further issues of tags subject only to compliance with the regulations. In the case of dealers the regulations provide for the issue of tail tags to dealers in respect of imported fish. There is no maximum limit on the number of tags which may be issued to any individual licence holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operational responsibility for the tagging <Col N="1246" /> scheme rests with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards. The central board, which has a co-ordinating role, informs me that all regional boards are making considerable efforts to ensure that any licence holder requiring tags receives them as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I have made significant additional funding available through the fisheries boards to support catchment management projects in co-operation with local stakeholders. A total of £1.9 million was spent by the fisheries boards in 2000 on a range of projects throughout the country. In particular, the fisheries boards collectively invested a sum of £244,000 in the provision of geographical information systems which are essential tools for fisheries management and a sum of £125,000 on a sustained public awareness campaign for catchment management involving the production and promotion of a suite of material entitled &ldquo;From Source to Sea&rdquo; which consisted of a brochure, video and a poster.</P>
      <P>Further projects undertaken in the regions during 2000 are set out in the following tables.</P>

      <P>The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 provides that I may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, compulsorily acquire either permanently or temporarily any such land or ancillary right which I consider is necessary for the efficient or convenient exploitation of petroleum. This can be done by a working facilities acquisition order made under the Act.</P>
      <P>When it is proposed to make a working facilities acquisition order, the Minister is required to serve notice on every person appearing to him to have an interest in such land, notice of his intention of doing so at least two months before making such an order and if there is a dwelling place on such land, at least four months, and publish in one or more newspapers circulating in the locality in which such land is situated a like notice of his intention. Such notices, if they relate to the acquisition of land, must state the situation and area of such land, with sufficient particularity to enable such land to be easily identified, and state the nature and duration of the interest proposed to be acquired in such land. If such notice relates to the acquisition of an ancillary right, it must state the nature of such right, the land or other property in respect of which such right is proposed to be acquired and the period for which such right is proposed to be acquired.</P>
      <P>The Minister shall be liable to pay compensation for any land or ancillary right acquired under a working facility acquisition order. All claims for compensation payable may be made any time within six months or such longer period altogether not exceeding 12 months as the Minister may in any particular case allow after the date of the order, and no such claim shall be entertained unless made within that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, upon the grant of a petroleum lease or at any time during the term granted by the lease, grant to the lessee a permit, <Col N="1250" /> on such terms and such conditions as the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance determines, to use any land or ancillary right which has been acquired by the working facilities acquisition order. The person to whom the permit is granted must repay the Minister the costs incurred by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Foreshore is the land and seabed between the high water of ordinary or medium tides &ndash; shown HWM on Ordnance Survey maps &ndash; and the 12 mile limit. The proposed route so far by Enterprise Oil for the Corrib field offshore pipeline and umbilical would make landfall on the Dooncarton side of Broadhaven Bay, a short distance south west of the sand dunes.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Oil has applied separately for permission to conduct site investigation works later this summer along a 50 metre wide x 1000 metre long corridor about one kilometre offshore, north of Dooncarton. The pipeline is intended to be buried in a three metre deep trench passing through this area. The site investigation works will determine the extent of bedrock in the area in order to ascertain the excavation methods which will later need to be employed if the development is allowed to proceed. The proposed site investigation works were advertised in local and national newspapers during the month of May.</P>
      <P>A definitive route has not yet been identified by Enterprise Oil for a discharge pipeline and outfall. My Department has requested further information before proceeding with consideration of the foreshore licence application. Enterprise Oil is currently preparing a supplementary report to the original environmental impact statement which will provide more detailed information on the intended route of the discharge pipeline. The supplement will also provide additional information on the exact point and method of landfall for the gas pipeline and will be made available to the public. The date for completion of the supplement is a matter for Enterprise Oil.</P>

I have cautioned against excessive raising of expectations regarding compensatory payments and against the belief that all active commercial salmon fishermen are willing to be bought out.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously the national salmon commission is working to form a late consensus advice on this matter, which is being complemented by detailed analysis by my Department of overall policy directions in relation to the commercial salmon fishing sector and which will inform my consideration and decision on the way forward.</P>

      <P>Under the fisheries Acts, the regional fisheries boards are responsible for issuing salmon fishing licences. The Southern Regional Fisheries Board informs me that the person concerned was the subject of a consequential disqualification order following conviction for offences under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board informs me that, subsequent to the period of disqualification, applications for a drift net licence by the person concerned were considered by the board in accordance with the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders, 1980 to 1997. <Col N="1253" /> The orders set maximum numbers of licences which may be issued by the regional fisheries boards in each fishery district. Under these orders priority is first given to applications from persons who derived a substantial part of their livelihood from fishing for salmon under a licence issued in the previous year. Accordingly, the person concerned is accorded a lower priority which, given the maximum number of licences applicable, has resulted in his application being unsuccessful.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided last September to move progressively to the United Nations target for overseas development aid of 0.7% of GNP.

Following this decision, agreement was reached between the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs on a three year allocation for Vote 39 for the period 2001-2003. The amounts agreed were as follows: 2001 &ndash; £188 million, an increase of £51 million; 2002 &ndash; £293 million, an increase of £105 million; 2003 &ndash; £347 million, an increase of £54 million.</P>

      <P>The Government greatly values the role played by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement &ndash; Red Cross family &ndash; in the provision of assistance to people affected by conflict, displacement and disaster worldwide. The Red Cross family is made up of the national societies, of which the Irish Red Cross is one, the International Committee of the Red Cross &ndash; ICRC &ndash; and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies &ndash; IFRC. The ICRC and the IFRC are two of the partner organizations with which the Government works in <Col N="1254" /> responding to emergencies and humanitarian disasters.</P>
      <P>Each year the ICRC and IFRC launch their respective annual emergency appeals. Appeals are also launched following sudden onset disasters. These appeals are the normal channels through which Ireland Aid, in liaison with the Irish Mission to the United Nations in Geneva, allocates funding to the Red Cross. As both of these international agencies are based in Geneva, contact is made and maintained through the Irish Mission in Geneva rather than the Irish Red Cross.</P>
      <P>Ireland contributed a total of £1,540,000 to the ICRC in 2000 for humanitarian relief and rehabilitation assistance programmes. During the same period, the Department of Defence made a separate, multilateral contribution of £100,000 to the ICRC by way of its annual contribution towards its organisational costs. So far this year, the Government has contributed £750,000 to the ICRC for its appeals in Burundi, Iraq and Sudan. Further assistance for disbursal through the ICRC is anticipated in 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition, the IFRC received £444,613 during 2000 for humanitarian emergencies in Belize, Madagascar, Mongolia and Venezuela. To date during 2001, the federation has received a total of £450,000 from the Government in response to the earthquakes which struck El Salvador and India.</P>
      <P>As part of its ongoing responses to humanitarian emergencies, the Government will continue to work closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross and its affiliates in the Red Cross family. This reflects the high regard in which they are held by Ireland and other members of the international community and the important role which they fulfil in providing early assistance to vulnerable and suffering people.</P>

      <P>National preparations for the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, which will take place in South Africa from 31 August to 7 September 2001, have been intensifying since a national preparatory conference took place in Dublin Castle in September 2000. Following the national preparatory conference, Ireland participated in the European preparatory conference in Strasbourg. The Irish delegation was led by my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> I have discussed preparations for the world conference with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, in her capacity as secretary-general of the conference, most recently at our meeting on 15 May. I have assured the High Commissioner of the Government's full support for a successful outcome to the conference. Our overall approach, which is closely co-ordinated with our EU partners, is to seek a successful outcome to the conference, an outcome which is forward looking and action oriented. On the difficult issues which have arisen, such as compensation for historical wrongs, we are adopting a flexible but realistic approach.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group has been established, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to consider the draft outcome documents for the conference. In addition, a number of Irish NGOs with direct experience in tackling racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in Ireland have been consulted. The outcome of NGO consultations organised by the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism, NCCRI, has been particularly useful. It has contributed to the negotiating position of the Irish delegation on EU co-ordination on the substantive issues arising at the conference. Amnesty International has made a number of recommendations in relation to the world conference and these have also been considered in our preparations for the conference. A number of its specific proposals are reflected in the EU approach.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that progress at the second session of the preparatory committee for the world conference against racism, which took place in Geneva from 21 May to 1 June 2001, was extremely slow. A cross-regional group of 21 states met last week and will continue meeting this week, and possibly beyond, in an attempt to make further progress on the key substantive issues. The EU Presidency is represented on the cross-regional group and Ireland has been actively engaged in inputting to the Presidency's negotiating position in that group. There will be a third preparatory committee from 30 July to 10 August to continue negotiations, at which Ireland will also be represented.</P>
    <P>While it is clear from the preparatory negotiations that it will be difficult to reach agreement on the contentious issues, we will continue to do everything possible to achieve a successful and consensual outcome to the conference.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received a report from GOAL on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; if he is conscious of the role played by Uganda and Rwanda in the affairs of the Congo; if he proposes any changes in the Government's aid programme to Uganda and Rwanda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the UN panel of experts report, which looked at the involvement of neighbouring states in the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC.</P>
      <P>The report, which was critical of the two states which most openly co-operated with its investigation, Rwanda and Uganda, while making no comment on the Congo itself, on Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola, has not been accepted by the UN Security Council, which has sought further investigation. The report has been viewed with some criticism by donors operating in Uganda, who see its findings as unbalanced and heavily reliant on hearsay evidence.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, there is a core governance issue arising from foreign involvement in the DRC. The concerns of countries providing assistance to Uganda &ndash; Ireland does not have an embassy in Rwanda and its assistance there is limited &ndash; have been brought to the attention of the Ugandan authorities, most recently in a meeting in Brussels between the Minister of State and the Ugandan Prime Minister. Arising from this pressure, Uganda has agreed to set up a judicial tribunal, headed by a respected British born jurist, to investigate the report's findings. That tribunal will question all relevant witnesses, including President Museveni himself.</P>
      <P>In addition, Uganda is implementing the elements of the Lusaka Accord on the DRC and has withdrawn most of its forces from the region. These measures, taken together, have addressed much of the unease of donors. The most direct evidence of restored donor confidence in Uganda was the decision two weeks ago by the World Bank, which has widespread international support, to provide a credit of $300 million as direct assistance to Uganda. The support is geared at accelerating the process of poverty reduction on which Uganda has an exemplary record.</P>
      <P>I note the Deputy's reference to the UN report as a GOAL one. Clearly this is not the case. However, it is the case that the report has been used by John O'Shea of GOAL in an ill-considered campaign against the Irish government's aid programme, Ireland Aid, a significant part of which is implemented in partnership with six governments in Africa. The Irish programme is an outstanding one with a high reputation among fellow donors, partner countries and aid agencies.</P>

      <P>Guidelines for the consideration of applications for annual bus passenger licences in respect of the greater Dublin area under the Road Transport Act, 1932 were published last December and applicants were invited to submit applications before 16 February 2001. A total of 26 applications from private bus operators were processed in accordance with the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the applications, offers of 21 licences were made to the successful applicants on 31 May 2001. Applicants have been asked to indicate, in principle, within a two week period if they wish to accept the licence offers. Applicants who accept the offers will then have a further two months to submit the necessary documentation. Licences will be granted once all the relevant documentation is in order and will be subject to a condition that the relevant service, in its entirety, is commenced within a period of four months of the licence award.</P>

      <P>Specific details concerning the administration of the Aer Lingus, ESB and An Post pension schemes are matters for the trustees of the pension schemes and the companies concerned having regard to the rules of the relevant schemes. I have no function in relation to these matters. I am advised by Aer Lingus that the airline is complying with the terms of the general employees scheme and meeting all its liabilities.

      <P>Planning in the vicinity of Dublin Airport is a matter for Fingal County Council and in that regard certain areas of land in the approaches to the runways have been designated in the Fingal county development plan for many years as so-called red zones. These are areas in which physical structures, if erected, might interfere with the take off and landing of aircraft at the airport.</P>
      <P>I understand from Aer Rianta that there are a number of private sector commercial enterprises located within these areas around Dublin Airport. These either preceded the development of the runways or were granted planning permission subsequently by the planning authorities. The company informs me that there are also a small number of commercial developments and social facilities located within the red zones on land owned by Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>I also refer the Deputy to my response today to Question No. 176 on the designation of public safety zones at Dublin and other airports. Public safety zones are a different concept to the long standing red zones.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta informs me that it already consults widely with interested parties, including airport users, local authorities and local residents on issues relating to the development of the three State airports. I am advised by Aer Rianta that it operates an open door policy at all three airports and the company is happy and willing to meet with any interested party to discuss issues of concern in relation to the airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Dublin Airport, there are a wide variety of consultative groups and committees representative of the airlines, groundhandlers and other service providers, including the airport operators <Col N="1262" /> committee, five working groups on the future development of the airport, the users' committee on groundhandling and the Dublin Airport operations planning group. Aer Rianta management also meets regularly with members and officials of Fingal County Council to discuss planning, environmental and development matters in relation to the airport. The company also actively participates in the area sub-committees for the Fingal county development plan. Aer Rianta is also represented on the committees of many of the national and sectoral organisations and groups concerned with travel, tourism and commercial and development interests, including, for example, the Irish Hotels Federation, the Travel Trade Association, IBEC and chambers of commerce.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta provides significant resources and attention to dealing with any concerns expressed by individuals or local communities, including local residents associations, arising from the operation of Dublin Airport or from proposals in relation to the future sustainable development of the facility.</P>
    <P>At Shannon and Cork Airports, Aer Rianta local management also maintains a good open relationship with local public representatives and interest groups with the objective of keeping local people informed of airport developments and of listening to views on proposed future developments. At Shannon, for example, local Aer Rianta management participates in a wide variety of consultative groups, including the Mid-West Regional Authority and the Shannon Airport marketing consultative committee which is representative of the statutory, business and development sectors in the region. The company also consults and communicates with airport users at Shannon, Clare County Council, Shannon Town Commissioners, the mid-west committee of IBEC and local chambers of commerce, all of which, directly or indirectly, are representative of local and wider public interest and all make a significant contribution and input into the ongoing operations and future development of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The most significant consultative group at Cork Airport is the Cork Airport consultative committee which was formed last year and is operated under the aegis of the South West Regional Authority. It has broad representation, including local public representatives, Cork Chamber of Commerce and the IDA. The local residents association meets at least quarterly with airport management in Cork to discuss local issues relating to the planning and development of the airport and quarterly meetings are also held with the air transport users committee of Cork Chamber of Commerce. In addition, Aer Rianta informs me that there are several internal consultative groups within Cork Airport representing, for example, airlines, groundhandling agents, car hire and cargo operators. Regular consultation takes place with the local authority on planning matters and with other interest groups on request.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a licence issued to Bus Éireann to service housing estates off the western distributor road in Galway city was withdrawn and reallocated to another operator; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bus Éireann is a statutorily authorised provider of passenger road services and is therefore exempt from the requirement to hold a licence under the Road Transport Act, 1932.</P>
      <P>The company is, however, subject to statutory constraints over its operations. In particular, section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958 prohibits the company from initiating or altering a road passenger service so as to compete with a licensed passenger road service unless my consent has been obtained. The company is also subject to constraints in relation to the introduction of new services or changes to existing services which would give rise to competition with services envisaged in licence applications being considered by my Department. These constraints are imposed through a statutory direction which I issued to CIE with a view to ensuring fair treatment of all operators in the bus market.</P>
      <P>In February 2001, Bus Éireann notified the Department of proposed service changes to one of the company's existing bus routes in Galway city that includes the operation of services on the western distributor road. My Department responded in March to the effect that the proposed changes were approved. However, it was recently drawn to the attention of my Department that some of the new services proposed by Bus Éireann would give rise to competition with services already authorised by licences held by a private operator and with services which are the subject of amendments which have been sought to those licences.</P>
      <P>My Department is now urgently reviewing the matter. Bus Éireann has been advised that the outcome of the review may have the effect of prohibiting it from implementing the proposed service alterations in Galway city.</P>

      <P>Under the airports measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, an amount of £6 million in Exchequer funds has been allocated over that period to assist infrastructural improvements and upgrades in facilities at the regional airports in the southern and east<Col N="1264" /> ern region, that is, Kerry Airport and Waterford Airport.</P>
      <P>There has been no expenditure of these funds to date but in April last, my Department invited the airport authorities to submit their proposals for grant assistance to the Department by 31 May 2001. When all the requisite information is to hand, the proposals from Waterford will be examined, in conjunction with those from the other regional airports, in the light of the objectives of the airports measure and the funding available. It is anticipated that decisions on the selection of projects will be made at the end of the summer.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funds provided under the NDP, I have in recent years enhanced the programme of support for the marketing and promotional efforts of the regional airports. I have already allocated a sum of £200,000 from this marketing fund to Waterford Airport in recognition of the particular financial difficulties in which that airport found itself earlier this year. A sum of £150,000 has been paid over to date.</P>

      <P>Technologies to produce electricity from landfill gas are well established both here in Ireland and in other countries. The alternative energy requirement programme, administered by my Department, has supported landfill gas projects totalling 14.7 megawatts.</P>
      <P>The report Total Renewable Energy Resource in Ireland, 1997, prepared jointly by ESB International and the UK consultancy firm, Energy Technology Support Unit, ETSU, calculated that under certain assumptions, a potential landfill gas resource of 147 GWh, gigawatt hours, in year 2000. The actual contribution in year 2000 was 91 GWh.</P>
      <P>On 25 May last, I launched the fifth AER competition, AER V, which will offer contracts totaling 255 megawatts. The indicative target I have published for the biomass category, which includes landfill gas, is ten megawatts. I should not comment further about the likely success of any particular technology within the biomass category while the competitive process is ongoing. The final date for the receipt of tenders in AER V is the 30 August next.</P>

The current level of funding available for the scheme would not accommodate an expansion of the cases of the type implied in the question.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that applicants who do not qualify for grant aid under the farm electrification grant scheme can avail of ESB's deferred payments option. This allows applicants pay a deposit to the ESB and the balance over a period of one to five years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187, 188, 189 and 196 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross Society Order, 1939, as amended, is the establishment order of the society, made by the Government under the terms of section 1 of the Red Cross Act, 1938 &ndash; No. 32 of 1938. This order prescribes that not less than one third of the total membership of the central council is nominated by the Government. The other members of the central council consist of members elected from the society's areas. Currently the Government has nominated 17 persons <Col N="1267" /> as members of the central council of the Irish Red Cross for the period up to 30 April 2003. This represents 40% of the total membership of the central council.</P>
    <P>The legislation governing the Irish Red Cross Society was last amended by the Irish Red Cross Society (Amendment) Order, 1999, S.I. No. 44 of 1999. This amendment revoked paragraph (2) of Article 5 of the Irish Red Cross Society Order, 1939, thereby enabling the society to make rules which will, (a) provide for the persons, including other than Irish citizens, who may become members of the society; and (b) allow for refusal of, and removal from, membership of the society for good and sufficient reasons.</P>
    <P>Under the strategic plan recently adopted by the society, I understand that all matters relating to the structure and governance of the society will be addressed and should any legislative changes be required I will bring forward appropriate legislation. As I have already indicated, the Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council. I have no function in the administration of the Irish Red Cross and I do not get involved in the day to day running of its affairs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 to 195, inclusive, and 197 to 199, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have no function in the administration of the Irish Red Cross Society. I do not get involved in the day to day running of its affairs. The society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council. I am also mindful that a fundamental principle of the International Red Cross is that all Red Cross and Red Crescent societies enjoy freedom from political involvement worldwide. My Department, as in the past, is available to provide help and assistance to the society as and when requested.</P>
      <P>My Department administers a grant-in-aid to the Irish Red Cross Society, which this year amounts to £609,000. The grant-in-aid mainly covers the salaries of 14 permanent staff in the headquarters of the society and salary and related expenses for a staff member on full-time secondment to the Directorate for Asylum Seekers Services, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It also includes the State's annual contribution of £100,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. The grant-in-aid does not apply to overseas delegates serving with the International Red Cross.</P>
      <P>Under the strategic plan recently adopted by the society, I understand that all matters relating to the structure and governance of the society will be addressed and should any legislative changes be required I will bring forward appropriate legislation. The strategy objectives set out in Strategy 2010 as outlined by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is a matter for the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The Irish Red Cross Society has, I understand, appointed a national communications officer whose functions encompass that of a public relations officer. The duties of any official of the society are primarily a matter for that organisation.</P>

      <P>The Army No. 1 Band is located in Dublin and is one of three military brass and reed bands, the other two bands being located at Cork and Athlone. A programme of free public recitals by the Defence Forces bands takes place each year. The scheme operates during the spring-summer period and allows bands to perform in parks and other areas to which the public has free access.</P>
      <P>Apart from the above mentioned recitals, the three bands have to perform at various military and State functions and they may also be provided free of engagement fee to qualifying civilian bodies such as festivals, etc. In addition bands may be engaged on a paid basis.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations governing the early retirement scheme, a participant's early retirement pension must be reduced by the amount of any national pension he or she may be entitled to. On 6 December 2000 my Department wrote to the person named, advising him that as he would reach age 66 years on 13 March 2001 he should apply to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for the contributory and non-contributory old age pension and notify this Department of that Department's decision. As no response was received my Department suspended payment of his pension pending confirmation of his entitlement to the old age pension. This procedure is necessary to prevent overpayments under the early retirement scheme which my Department would then have to recover.</P>

Three other animals, tag numbers 231148110095, 231148160100 and 231148180102, were also rejected under the cattle headage scheme as they had no passports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department wrote to him on 8 December 2000 advising him that as he was in breach of the terms and conditions of the cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes, in relation to animal identification and registration requirements, reduction penalties would apply to his applications under both schemes. He was given the <Col N="1274" /> opportunity to have these decisions reviewed. His application for a review was received in my Department on 1 May 2001.

      <P>The agreement with the European Commission leading to the approval of supplementary measure A of the rural environment protection scheme provides for detailed commonage framework plans to be drawn up for all commonage land. These plans are being prepared under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The main aim of these plans will be to set sustainable stocking levels which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the detailed commonage framework plans for every commonage is at an advanced stage and when these plans are implemented stocking rates will be set which will reflect the environmental needs of each commonage.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of the detailed framework plans for individual commonages, my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put in place an interim national commonage framework plan. The interim plan required destocking equivalent to 30% of mountain ewes from November-December 1998 for flockholders not already in the REP scheme who used commonage in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, where the overgrazing issue was deemed to be the most serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement with the Commission provides for a global approach to the problem of overgrazing on commonages, of which measure A of the REP scheme is one element. It also provides for <Col N="1275" /> a complimentary national scheme. I am informed that the European Commission is currently considering proposals from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the national scheme, it will be a condition of eligibility for my Department's compensatory allowance and premia schemes that farmers with commonage land participate either in the national scheme or in REPS.</P>

This figure was more advantageous to the herd owner than the alternative which was 908 gallons based on the highest milk production over the qualifying period, I January to 20 September 1999, divided by the least cow number and with 100 gallons added for each qualifying cow.</P>
      <P>Under the compensation arrangements, milk production figures in respect of the calendar years 1997 or 1999 cannot be used in calculating the notional herd average milk yield having regard to the date of the initial disease breakdown on 20 September 1999.</P>

      <P>The first phase of the fallen animal collection scheme was introduced on 1 December 2000 when the gate fee was removed for fallen animal material delivered to dedicated rendering plants and the State undertook the full cost of rendering and destruction of the final product. Prior to that the entry to the dedicated rendering plant had been permitted at a rate substantially lower than the existing commercial charge. The first phase of the scheme has proven successful and has resulted in a substantial increase in the volume of fallen animal material delivered to rendering plants. Additional further rendering facilities have now been approved to process fallen animal material and this will contribute to maximising the efficiency of the collection service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> The second phase of the scheme has involved detailed negotiations with various interested groups, including farmers representatives and animal collectors, to agree a subsidised collection charge at farm level. These negotiations are at an advanced stage. In addition, the issue of extending the fallen animal service to include other species has been raised and is being actively considered. It is my intention to introduce the last stage of the scheme involving a further subsidised collection service at farm level in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Having regard to foot and mouth disease and the danger of it spreading because of the close physical contact between the sheep shearer and the sheep, a temporary ban on shearing was introduced from 1 May to 28 May. Statutory Instrument No. 228 of 2001 introduced a regime which allowed for the resumption of commercial sheep shearing with effect from 28 May 2001 under certain conditions. One of the conditions is a requirement for commercial sheep shearers to register with the Department.</P>
      <P>In order to be registered as a commercial sheep shearer an applicant is required to supply the following: name, address, telephone number, date of birth and personal public service number. The PPSN is required as a data item to assist in the identification of individuals. A copy of a passport is accepted in cases where the applicant is not an Irish national and therefore is not in a position to supply a personal public service number. A registration certificate issues in respect of each completed application on the basis that the applicant complies with the conditions attached to the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 to 2001, and the Regulation of Sheep Shearing Order, 2001.</P>
      <P>To date 408 persons have been entered on my Department's register of commercial sheep shearers. The Restriction on Movement of Persons Order No. 160 of 2001 restricts persons who have been on an agriculture related place or premises in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands from entering farms in the State for a period of 21 days after arrival. This restriction has been lifted in respect of the North.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission examination for approval of the Leader+ operational programme has progressed through a number of Commission procedural stages. My Department is in active negotiation with a view to finalisation and obtaining approval of the operational programme within the next number of weeks. Approval of the Leader+ programme will also clear the way for commencement of the Leader national rural development programme.</P>
      <P>The process of selecting local development groups to deliver the two programmes is proceeding in parallel. The independent consultant contracted to assess the business plans submitted by groups by way of application to be considered for delivery of the programmes is concluding the work and will make recommendations which will be taken into account. It is expected that the selection committee will arrive at conclusions within a short time frame, having regard to the terms of the Commission's approval when received. I will then make a report to Government and the appointment of the appropriate number of groups will be decided by Government. The selected rural development groups will be contracted to deliver the programmes and funding will be allocated to the groups concerned.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it is my intention that all areas of the country can benefit from Leader activity. Waterford Leader Partnership Limited has submitted business plans by way of application to deliver both new programmes. All of the business plans submitted by rural development groups are being given thorough consideration.</P>

      <P>Sheep are considered to present a particular risk in the spread of foot <Col N="1280" /> and mouth disease because of the difficulty in diagnosing the disease and the length of the incubation period in the species. For this reason it remains the case that normal movement of sheep has not yet been allowed to resume. Equally, I do not yet consider it appropriate to allow sheep back on to the Curragh where there is open grazing and to which the public has access.</P>
      <P>I will keep this matter under review in the light of veterinary advice on the results of the programme of serological screening for FMD of up to 200,000 sheep in which my Department is at present engaged and the ongoing risk overhang from the UK.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a range of animal movement controls has been introduced in recent months as a precautionary measure against the possible spread of foot and mouth disease. The incubation period of FMD in sheep is long and the disease can be particularly difficult to clinically diagnose in sheep. In these circumstances the movement of sheep is allowed only under permit either for slaughter or for welfare reasons.</P>
      <P>The flock owner referred to by the Deputy is at liberty to apply to his local district veterinary office for a movement permit and his application will be assessed on the basis of the standard criteria.</P>

      <P>The EU regulations governing the purchase for destruction scheme require beef purchased under the scheme to be destroyed. Therefore, it is not open to me to make the beef available to charitable organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase for destruction scheme will be replaced by a new special purchase scheme with effect from 1 July. Under the new scheme member states will have the option of either destroying the beef or storing it for eventual dis<Col N="1285" /> posal as food aid or other humanitarian purposes. The disposal of the beef will be subject to prior approval of the Commission in the context of the beef management committee.</P>
    <P>I have not yet taken any definitive decision on this matter. Any decision to store the beef for eventual use by charitable organisations will have to take account of the level of demand, the precise requirements of charitable organisations, the length of time the beef is likely to remain in store before release and the logistics, the cost and controls involved in a mixed destruction-storage approach.</P>

      <P>In accordance with European Commission guidelines, my Department submitted the Leader+ draft operational programme to the European Commission in November. The examination for approval has progressed through a number of Commission procedural stages and my Department is actively negotiating with the Commission with a view to finalisation and obtaining approval of the operational programme within the next number of weeks. Approval of the Leader+ programme will also clear the way for commencement of the Leader national rural development programme.</P>
      <P>The process of selecting local development groups to deliver the two programmes is proceeding in parallel. The independent consultant contracted to assess the business plans submitted by groups by way of application to be considered for delivery of the programmes is concluding the work and will make recommendations which will be taken into account. It is expected that the selection committee will arrive at conclusions within a short time frame, having regard to the terms of the Commission's approval when received. I will then make a report to Government and the appointment of the appropriate number of groups will be decided by Government. The selected rural development groups will be contracted to deliver the programmes and funding will be allocated to the groups concerned.</P>

    <P>The above named herdowner's forage area of 37.1 hectares entitled the applicant to 74.2 reckonable livestock units. As the applicant had no milk quota, ewe premium or suckler cow premium the full 74.2 LUs were allocated to special beef premium.</P>
    <P>As many as eight special beef premium applications were submitted. On the third application, six tags were shown to have been paid on previously and, in accordance with the regulations, were deleted and counted for premium stocking density. The above named was advised of this in writing on 29 February 2000.</P>
    <P>Including the six deleted tags, applications 1 to 7, inclusive, accounted for 70.2 LUs, leaving four LUs, or 6.66 premium rights, available for application 8. Accordingly, as 12 tags had been applied on, the application was restricted to payment of 6.66 premium rights.</P>
    <P>The EU regulations governing these schemes specifically provide that animals applied on in excess of the individual herdowner's permitted stocking rate of two livestock units per hectare are deemed to be paid under the instalment applied for.</P>

    <P>While most farmers stand to gain under these new arrangements there will be some who will incur modest losses. I have negotiated a compensation package for those who lose out under which 90% of their losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under this arrangement the average loss in County Sligo in 2001 will be about £25 rising to about £50 in 2002. The Department is currently carrying out a review to see if an equitable long-term solution can be found to the problem of reduced payments, particularly in mountain type areas.</P>

He was advised by letter of 30 April 2001 that these animals were rejected and that in fact he had been overpaid by £1,179.12 under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme and by £36.32 under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme euro compensation. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed and a reply was received by my Department on 4 May 2001 from the wife of the person named in which she stated that the person named had been ill. An officer of my Department spoke to her by telephone on 14 May 2001 and asked that medical evidence concerning her husband's illness be provided.

      <P>The requirement to hold cattle for a period of 30 days was, along with many other controls, introduced as part of a range of measures to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. It is clear that severe hardship would have resulted for the farming and other sectors had the disease taken hold here.</P>
      <P>The measures adopted are under continuous review by the expert group appointed to advise on such matters. I have made a number of announcements in recent weeks in relation to the phased dismantling of various controls on the basis of advice from the group.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of the 30 day retention rule, the expert group has today recommended that the rule should be retained for farm to farm movements and for sales through the marts. However, it has provided for an exemption for cattle going for export through approved assembly centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that this adjustment, along with a number of other adjustments in relation to movement controls which I will be announce <Col N="1293" /> today, will go some considerable way towards facilitating the assembly of animals for export.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the foot and mouth disease and the danger of it spreading because of the close physical contact between the sheep shearer and the sheep, a temporary ban on shearing was introduced from 1 May to 28 May.</P>
      <P>Following a joint submission from organisations representing farmers, sheep shearers and the Irish Wool Federation a regulated regime was introduced with effect from 28 May. This included, <i>inter alia</i>, the registration of commercial sheep shearers. The regime is detailed in S.I. No. 228 of 2001, a copy of which I have arranged to be sent to the Deputy. There is no restriction on farmers shearing their own sheep. These new measures will be kept under review in the light of ongoing developments in relation to the foot and mouth disease control.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some farmers may be experiencing difficulties in meeting their repayments and inspectors from my Department have been visiting farmers who have arrears of £2,000 and over with a view to assessing the reasons for non-payment.

Their annual annuity liability is £1,360 which is not considered to be unduly excessive.</P>
      <P>At present 6,800 farmers have land annuity commitments amounting to £1.7 million annually and at the end of April as many as 4,900 of them had some arrears amounting to £4.3 million in total.</P>

      <P>My Department has looked into the matter and found no basis for the suggestion that the EU intends to restrict purchasers to borrowing no more than 90% of the price of a residential property. Perhaps the article in question related to a recommendation published by the European Commission in March 2001 on a voluntary code of conduct on pre-contractual information which invites lenders to provide consumers with general information regarding their lending procedures and a standardised European information sheet which sets a template for mortgage offers. The recommendation was negotiated under the auspices of the Commission by associations and federations representing lenders, on the one hand, and consumers, on the other.</P>
      <P>The general information would include such items as the name and address of the lending institution, the purposes for which a loan can be used, forms of surety accepted, a description of the types of home loans available, types of interest rate, the possibility and conditions pertaining to repayment, rules pertaining to valuation, general information on tax relief and reflection periods, where relevant.</P>
      <P>The standardised information sheet for mortgage offers would not be a legally binding offer. It would include a description of the particular mortgage product being offered, noting the surety. It should make clear whether the home loan terms are dependent on the consumer supplying a certain amount of capital. Also included on this sheet are the nominal and annual percentage interest rates, amount of credit advanced, the duration of the loan agreement, insurance requirements, early repayment terms, information on internal complaint schemes and so on.</P>

      <P>EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, requires that VAT applies to the supply of most goods or services where supplied for a charge. As the Deputy is aware VAT is a tax on the final consumption of a good or service and must therefore be imposed on the final users which in this case is the domestic consumer of gas.</P>
      <P>As regards the rate which applies, VAT is chargeable on all home heating fuels at the reduced rate of 12.5% in Ireland. Under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, we cannot reduce the rate on a list of goods and services below 12%, where a reduced rate applied to such goods and services before 1 January 1991. This is commonly known as the parking rate facility and includes all fuel. Reducing the rate of VAT by 0.5% on the supply of all fuels, including gas, would be of little benefit to the consumer.</P>

It was subsequently considered that the commencement order should be delayed pending the result of a High Court challenge to the scheme.

In the circumstances, it is considered that the commencement order should not be signed until clarification on the matter has been received from the Commission. Officials from my Department, working jointly with officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, have submitted papers on the scheme planned for implementation in Ireland to the Commission and a response is now awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to parliamentary Question No. 2 of 17 May 2001 in reply to a question about persons complying with the terms of the Revenue statement of practice.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the clear indications are that most of the bogus non-resident accounts identified during the DIRT look-back exercise were in existence before 1991. There was, therefore, an obligation on the account holders concerned to comply with the terms of the 1993 amnesty but it is not known how many of them did not participate at all in the amnesty or how many participated but did not make a full disclosure. A person who complied with the terms of the 1993 legislation would have been able to satisfy all liabilities, including tax, interest and penalties, with a payment of 15% of the amounts of income undeclared.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that both categories of bogus account holders come within the scope of the statement of practice and will now be subject to a significantly more severe regime provided for in the statement. A person who did not comply at all with the amnesty will now have to pay all of the tax liability and, in addition, an amount in respect of interest and penalties. Under the statement of practice that additional amount is capped at 100% of the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who did not make a full disclosure under the amnesty loses the benefits of the amnesty in accordance with the 1993 legislation. That person, if he or she now avails of the voluntary disclosure arrangements under the statement <Col N="1299" /> of practice, will have to pay the full tax, including full tax on the partial disclosure under the tax amnesty, plus up to the same amount again in interest and penalties subject only to a credit for the actual amount paid under the 1993 amnesty, as provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>As I made clear in my response to the earlier question referred to, persons already under inquiry by Revenue on 2 May 2001 or coming within the scope of the Ansbacher investigation, the Flood tribunal or the Moriarty tribunal may not avail of the arrangements set out in the statement of practice. Where persons knowingly or wilfully evaded tax liabilities in respect of periods covered by the 1993 amnesty and were required to avail of that amnesty but did not do so or did not fully comply with the disclosure requirements, they are guilty of offences under the 1993 legislation.</P>
    <P>A successful prosecution of such offences would require the necessary investigations and proofs to be established in a court of law. Revenue has informed me that, because of the very large numbers of cases which are involved, the available Revenue resources must be deployed in the most practical and effective way. It would be impossible to investigate for prosecution every person who did not comply with the 1993 legislation. Clearly Revenue takes the view that investigations with a view to prosecution are better concentrated on those persons who do not avail of the statement of practice and this will be done after 15 November next.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in response to the earlier question, I am satisfied that the Revenue approach, as set out in its statement of practice, is the most practical and effective way of dealing with a task which is unprecedented in terms of scale.</P>

      <Quest>the stamp duty and other taxation exemptions and reliefs available to a young qualifying farmer who is under 35 years of age and has achieved the necessary educational qualifications, and who is taking over his parents' land as they are retiring from farming; if any additional exemptions were made available in recent budgets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to promote lifetime transfers of land and encourage more young people to pursue farming, the Finance Act, 1994, provided for a two thirds relief from stamp duty on the transfer of land to a young trained farmer. This relief was introduced for a three year period and was extended for a further three years until 31 December 1999 in the Finance Act, 1997. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the two thirds relief was increased to a full relief in the <Col N="1300" /> Finance Act, 2000, for three years until 31 December 2002.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the relief a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; is one who is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer and is the holder of one of the specified qualifications, for example, the Teagasc certificate in farming or, if born before 1 January 1968, has three years experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours duration.</P>
      <P>Where the transferee has completed at least one academic year of the Teagasc certificate in farming at the date of execution of the transfer, he or she may obtain the relief by way of a refund, provided the qualification is obtained within three years of the date of execution of the transfer.</P>
      <P>There is provision in legislation for 90% relief from capital acquisitions tax, CAT, in respect of gifts and inheritances of certain agricultural property. The latter may include agricultural land, farmhouses, farm buildings, farm machinery and bloodstock. The relief is not restricted to, but would include, young qualifying farmers. To avail of the relief 80% of his or her gross property must, after the taking of the gift, comprise of agricultural property, livestock, bloodstock and farm machinery.</P>
      <P>Where the donee has taken no prior gifts or inheritances from either or both of his or her parents since 2 December 1988 and is receiving a gift of agricultural land from parents, he or she may also avail of the group one exempt threshold which applies where the donee is a child of the disponer or disponers. This amount is currently £316,800. Therefore, a child can take a benefit of £3,168,000 in qualifying assets from a parent or parents free of CAT, that is, 90% relief worth £2,851,200 plus the balance of 10% or £316,800 which is covered by the threshold.</P>
      <P>Certain full-time farmers can avail of income averaging where, instead of being charged to tax on their farming profits in the normal way, that is, on the profits of a 12 month period ending in the year of assessment, a farmer may elect to be charged on the basis of the average of the aggregate farming profits and losses of the three years ending in the year of assessment. In effect, one third of the profits for the three years is charged for a year. Farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession or who are directors of companies which carry on a trade or profession cannot elect for income averaging. An exception is provided for in the case of the provision of farmhouse holidays. Once an election for averaging is made, a farmer must remain on averaging for a minimum of three years. If the farmer wishes to revert to the normal basis of assessment, the two years of assessment immediately before the final year of averaging are reviewed and, if necessary, additional assessments are made to ensure that the amount charged for each of those two years is not less than the amount charged for the final year of averaging.</P>

      <Col N="1301" /> Persons chargeable to tax on their farming profits may claim a farm buildings allowance for capital expenditure on the construction of farm buildings other than buildings used as a dwelling and certain other works such as fences, roadways, holding yards, drains, land reclamation and other works such as walls, water and electrical installation and sewerage. The cost is written off at the rate of 15% of the cost in each of the first six years with the remaining 10% in year seven.</P>
    <P>Farmers may also avail of a special scheme of capital allowances for farm pollution control where qualifying expenditure on necessary measures has been incurred. This scheme, which was introduced in the Finance Act, 1997, originally applied for three years from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000. It provided for a special year one allowance limit of 50% of expenditure incurred or £15,000, that is, 50% of £30,000, whichever is the lesser. The rest of the expenditure can be written down over seven years giving a total write down period of eight years. The limit was increased to £20,000, that is, 50% of £40,000, in the budget with effect from 6 April 1998.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 2000, made a number of changes to the scheme. It extended the scheme for a further three years to 5 April 2003. For expenditure incurred on or after 6 April 2000, it reduced the writing down period from eight to seven years. It also increased the limit to the lesser of 50% of the expenditure or £25,000, that is, 50% of £50,000. It converted the year one allowance into a floating allowance to be taken in whole or in part at any time over the writing down period.</P>
    <P>Farmers can also avail of the general five year write off period, that is, 20% per annum, for capital allowances for plant and machinery, which was introduced in the 2001 budget.</P>

      <P>The inspector contacted the taxpayer's agent who indicated that the taxpayer now wishes to have all his tax credits allocated to his PAYE income. An amended notice of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point for the current year was issued accordingly on 6 June 2001.</P>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person referred to in the question made an application on 6 April 2001 for exemption from VRT under the transfer of residence provisions in respect of the registration in the State of his UK registered vehicle. This application was refused because the person was unable to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that the basic conditions for the relief were met, especially in so far as the place of normal residence was concerned. The person subsequently appealed this refusal under the terms of section 104 of the Finance Act, 1995. The case will be reviewed by the appeals officer, a senior Revenue official who was not involved in the original decision to refuse the exemption. The person will be notified of the outcome of this appeal in due course together with any further rights of appeal should this be appropriate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> My Department has been making considerable improvements in relation to the amount of funding being made available to the Carers Association. The ongoing revenue grant was increased to £270,000 per annum in the year 2000 and further increased to £450,000 per annum in the year 2001. It is a matter for the association to decide on the range of services to be provided with this funding.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs has been paying a carer's allowance for some years to qualifying applicants. What my Department has tried to do is have the health boards give assistance to carers by the provision of a specific service and I have provided additional sums for the boards of £1 million, £1 million and £2 million in the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. I hope to continue this initiative over the next few years if funding is available.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs pays an annual respite grant of £300 to recipients of the carer's allowance. For those not in receipt of such allowance, a health board may provide assistance towards a respite break from the funding mentioned above, but it cannot be said that a respite break is provided for all carers. Additional funding in the future may resolve this problem and I will consider the options available in this regard in the light of funding available for next year.</P>
    <P>Details are not available in my Department as to how health board funding for carers or the Carers Association is distributed on a county by county basis. On a health board basis, however, Departmental funding was distributed as follows:</P>

      <P>As the provision of services for persons with an intellectual disability in the Waterford region is the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance, I have forwarded the Deputy's inquiry to the chief executive of the board for attention and direct reply.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware that, while there has been a significant level of investment in recent years in health-related support services, including speech and language therapy services, for both pre-school and children of schoolgoing age with an intellectual disability, autism, physical and sensory disabilities, the health boards and non-statutory agencies are experiencing difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals required to deliver these services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to take a flexible approach in using the resources which have been allocated to the services, including the possibility of the purchase of additional sessions, with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services.</P>
      <P>Some work still remains to be done in finalising Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates' report in relation to workforce planning for therapists. I expect that this report will be completed shortly and I am making arrangements to publish it in a few weeks time. Developments arising from the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report, together with some initial measures which my Department has already taken to increase the number of training places for certain allied health professionals, will provide for an increasing number of trained personnel for the services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is also probably aware, section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001, amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of psychological assessments and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278, 279 and 372 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22(3) of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120 and £150 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22(3) and 22(4) of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health Amendment (No. 3) Act, 1996. I am aware that the issue of paying enhanced subventions has been raised in the Southern Health Board area and in this regard officials of my Department are in regular contact with the board's officials to monitor the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Deputies that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Govern<Col N="1310" /> ment came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the course of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme. The assessment of entitlement to and payment of the mobility allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board with a request that she examine the query and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 359 together.</P>
      <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new therapies for many disorders becoming available.</P>
      <P>Arising from a number of meetings with interest groups, I requested Comhairle Na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> To examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle Na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 Comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
    <P>The need for additional investment in the neurological and neurosurgical service will be considered in the light of the review. I look forward to receiving An Chomhairle's report in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 288 together.</P>
      <P>Funding for MRI scanners in public hospitals is provided on the basis of clinical and service requirements for the care and treatment of public hospital patients. The recognition of MRI scanners by private health insurers, for the purpose of benefit payments under their plans, is an entirely separate matter and is a matter for decision by the relevant insurer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Insurance Act, 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations, 1996, set down a level of <Col N="1313" /> cover which insurers are obliged to provide as a minimum under each health insurance contract. The regulations recognise that insurers should be in a position to determine which service providers are to supply services to their members, as it would be disproportionate to require insurers, or any particular one of them, to include all service providers in their arrangements to cover the health care costs of members.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Voluntary Health Insurance board, in addition to the generally applicable health insurance regulatory framework, section 2 of the VHI (Amendment) Act, 1996, sets out the statutory position concerning the making of arrangements between VHI and service providers. This gives the board explicit powers in relation to entering into, or refusing to enter into, agreements with health service providers.</P>
    <P>Inquiries have been made of VHI about the position concerning cover for MRI scanners. It has advised that the board recently considered a number of applications for insurance cover in respect of MRI scanners, which included an application for an MRI scanner located at St James's Hospital. The board has not accepted St. James's case for cover in respect of out-patient MRI scans. It has, however, decided to provide insurance cover for MRI scans performed during medically necessary in-patient stays. This involves providing insurance cover for professional fees in accordance with VHI's schedule of benefits for professional fees and is subject to finalising the operational arrangements with the hospital.</P>

      <P>In general there are no difficulties in filling vacancies for consultant posts. The most recent figures on the level of vacancies for non-consultant <Col N="1314" /> hospital doctors in the public hospital service indicate that approximately 1% of posts are currently vacant. Current indications do not suggest that there will be any substantial increase in vacancies on 1 July this year. A national monitoring group has been established to keep the position pertaining to NCHD vacancies under review.</P>
      <P>This Department has been involved in a number of initiatives to improve recruitment and retention of NCHDs in the public health service. The Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation have negotiated a substantial agreement for improved terms and conditions for NCHDs. Legislation was passed in 2000 which amended the medical practitioners Act to allow for the temporary registration of doctors to be extended from five to seven years. A recruitment drive in India and Pakistan involving this Department, the faculty of anaesthetists, the Medical Council and the health boards took place last year to encourage doctors in those countries to come to Ireland for practical training. More than 50 doctors specialising in anaesthesia have taken up posts in Ireland as a result of this initiative.</P>
      <P>These measures have been helpful in retaining NCHDs who are already in the health service and have also attracted more doctors to work in our hospitals. The report of the forum on medical manpower and the report on NCHD working hours have recently been considered by Government and published. The Government has noted their recommendations and decided to establish a national task force to quantify the resource implications and costs arising from both reports.</P>

      <P>I presume that the report referred to by the Deputy is the report of the review group on maternity services in the North Eastern Health Board which was presented to the board in November 2000. The principal recommendations of the report were that consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan General Hospital and Louth County Hospital, Dundalk, should cease due to concerns about patient safety, a pilot centre for midwife-led obstetric services should be established in Louth County Hospital and consultant-led delivery units should be located at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and at Cavan General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the report has not been rejected. The health board decided not to accept in full the recommendations contained in the report and unanimously approved the establishment of a further review with a broader remit. This further review will reflect on the potential for cross-Border co-operation and the requirements of spatial planning as anticipated in the national development plan. I understand this further review is under way and that a report will be presented in the autumn.</P>

For this reason, following a Government decision on the matter, I established a commission on assisted human reproduction last year to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in the area.</P>
      <P>In examining the various issues, including that of sperm-banking, the commission is obliged to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriately with relevant interested parties.

      <P>Article 16(1) of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, provides that individuals resident in private nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention from the health board may not be charged extra for any service which is considered to be essential to their maintenance in the home and common <Col N="1318" /> practice in most nursing homes. Such services include bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person and incontinence wear.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently in place for the supply of incontinence wear by health boards to medical card holders living in the community. On 26 February, on the instructions of the Minister for Health and Children, a letter was issued to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority requesting that the boards ensure that medical card holders who have entered, or will enter, private nursing homes, retain their eligibility for incontinence wear under the GMS scheme and that all medical card holders in receipt of a subvention be supplied with incontinence wear on the same basis as if they were residing in the community.</P>
      <P>This request has logistical implications for the boards, including assessment and distribution issues. I am advised by the Mid-Western Health Board that the administration arrangements to implement this decision have not as yet been finalised. However, I am asking the board to put in place the arrangements as a matter of urgency. In the meantime, incontinence wear should still be supplied by private nursing home owners as provided for in article 16(1) of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to bring proposals to Government on whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families, who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use, to be refunded speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision, which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the <Col N="1319" /> cost of their parents nursing home care, was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, the issue of making payments will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Limerick area is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995, and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, stipulate that health boards shall pay foster parents or relatives who are fostering an &ldquo;allowance of not less than such amount as may from time to time be specified by the Minister&rdquo; and that this allowance shall be paid &ldquo;in respect of any child placed with them&rdquo;. Following the budget of December 2000 I was delighted to announce a restructuring of the foster care allowance.</P>
      <P>The proposed restructuring is one of the recommendations contained in the working group on foster care report which was launched earlier today. The report recommends that the discretionary payments scheme for foster carers be abolished and that the foster care allowances be increased from £71.55 to £200 per week per child of under 12 years, and from £85.75 to £220 per week per child of 12 years and over. A circular is being prepared by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which will be issued to all health boards in the near future in preparation for the introduction of the restructured allowance scheme at the end of July.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there is a system of registration in place for those providing beauty treatments.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy's concern relates to the use of Botox by those providing beauty treatments, I advise the Deputy that the Irish Medicines Board issued a press statement on 23 May 2001 expressing concern about the possible misuse of this product.</P>
      <P>The board in its statement indicated that Botox is a medicinal product and is primarily used in the treatment of severe muscular disorders. It warned that the active substance in Botox is the highly potent neurotoxin, Clostridium botulinum toxin type A. Under the conditions of the marketing authorisation the product should be given only in accordance with its authorised use by physicians with appropriate qualifications and documented expertise in the administration and uses of the required equipment.</P>
      <P>Investigations by the Irish Medicines Board have identified a number of beauty salons, cosmetic clinics and private individuals who are supplying and administering Botox as an injectible cosmetic treatment for wrinkles. Botox, or any of the other marketed Clostridium botulinum toxins are not authorised for cosmetic use and their safety under these conditions has not been established. The board pointed out that unauthorised persons engaged in this activity are in contravention of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, 1996, (S.I. No. 256 of 1996) and that any such business and/or unauthorised individuals will be liable to prosecution under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board in its statement warned that Botox may have a number of serious side effects some of which include ptosis, eyelid weakness, facial weakness, visual disturbance and corneal ulceration. On rare occasions it has been associated with adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including heart rhythm abnormalities and heart attacks. There have been reports of severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis following administration of the injection <Col N="1323" /> and in rare cases there have been fatalities. In the interests of safety, the board has advised potential customers that this is a prescription only product and that only registered medical practitioners or dentists should administer this medicine in accordance with the conditions of the licence.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by a number of acute hospitals in the Dublin area, including the Mater Hospital, in dealing with increasing demands on their services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is now at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I recently provided a special allocation of £3 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to facilitate a number of short-term measures to increase bed capacity in its area. The application of this funding is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my Department has therefore requested the regional chief executive of the authority to supply details to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the planned development of cancer services nationally has been guided by the national cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and the North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. It is the intention of my Department that phase two of the programme, which will involve the extension of BreastCheck nationwide, should follow phase one as soon as is practicably possible. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice.  </P>
      <P>Symptomatic breast cancer services are being developed in line with the core recommendations of the report of the subgroup of the national cancer forum on the development of symptomatic breast disease services. Funding for specialist breast disease services in the Mid-Western Health Board area will be considered in the context of the Estimates for 2002.</P>
      <P>Having regard to developments in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment, I established an expert working group under the chairmanship of Professor Donal Hollywood to examine radiotherapy requirements in the context of the further implementation of the national cancer strategy. The work of the expert group is at an advanced stage and the group's report is expected in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,315. When account is taken of the service of agency nurses of 423 per day and overtime working equivalent to 592 nurses per day, the net vacancy situation pertaining at 31 January 2001 stands at 300. The gross number of vacancies reported for the Eastern Regional Health Authority region, excluding the learning disability sector, was 1,148.79.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that a total of 4,226 nurses were recruited in the year ending 31 January 2001 and that a total of 2,954 resigned or retired in the same period. Accordingly, the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,272 nurses in the system. The number of nursing vacancies existing nationally on 30 September 2000 had fallen by 5% by 31 January 2001.</P>
      <P>A major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the current shortage of nurses and midwives. In particular a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment and reten<Col N="1326" /> tion strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses: payment of fees to nurses and midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses and midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses and midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy situation. A total of 1,224 working visas or work authorisations were issued to nurses from non-EU countries between June 2000 and April 2001. A number of hospitals in the Dublin area are reporting significant improvements in their position. For example, Beaumont Hospital, which at one stage last year was short 130 nurses, now has a full complement of nursing staff. The Mater Hospital is on target to reduce its vacancies to a low single figure by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>In response to the current shortage of nurses, I increased the number of training places last year by 300, from 1,200 to 1,500. This year a further 40 additional places have been created. It is intended to maintain the annual intakes of nursing students at this level in order to ensure an adequate supply of nurses for our health service into the future.</P>
    <P>In general there are no difficulties in filling vacancies for consultant posts. The most recent figures on the level of vacancies for non-consultant hospital doctors in the public hospital service indicate that approximately 1% of posts are currently vacant. Current indications do not suggest that there will be any substantial increase in the number of vacancies on 1 July this year. A national monitoring group has been established to keep the situation pertaining to NCHD vacancies under review.</P>
    <P>This Department has been involved in a number of initiatives to improve recruitment and retention of NCHDs in the public health service. The Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation have negotiated a substantial agreement for improved terms and conditions for NCHDs. Legislation was passed in 2000 which amended the medical practitioners act to allow for the temporary registration of doctors to be extended from five to seven years. A recruitment drive in India and Pakistan involving this Department, the faculty of anaesthetists, the Medical Council and the health boards took place last year to encourage doctors in those countries to come to Ireland for practical training. Over 50 doctors specialising in anaesthesia have taken up posts in Ireland as a result of this initiative.</P>
    <P>These measures have been helpful in retaining NCHDs who are already in the health service and <Col N="1327" /> have also attracted more doctors to work in our hospitals. The report of the forum on medical manpower and the report on NCHD working hours have recently been considered by Government and published. The Government has noted their recommendations and decided to establish a national task force to quantify the resource implications and costs arising from both reports.</P>

      <P>In Circular No. 154/2000, dated 13 December 2000, the chief executive officers of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and all direct funded voluntary agencies were informed that with effect from 2001 onwards, all additional personnel, including speech and language therapists, to be recruited during each coming year were to be identified in their service plans <Col N="1330" /> which are submitted to my Department at the beginning of that year. All additional posts are to be funded in the context of development moneys allocated by my Department. In accepting these plans, my Department automatically accepts the appointment of the additional posts identified in the plans.</P>
      <P>This year my Department identified ongoing revenue funding totalling £12 million, rising to £24 million in the year 2002, for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this £2 million was identified for the development of therapy services throughout the country. The Mid-Western Health Board was allocated £160,000, rising to £320,000 in 2002, for the development of its therapy services.</P>
      <P>I am unaware of any further submissions being made to this Department for the allocation of further speech and language posts from the Mid-Western Health Board nor is it appropriate that such submissions are made subsequent to the acceptance of the board's service plan.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from the 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, the issue of making payments will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Southern Health Board is responsible for the provision of ambulance services in its functional area, which includes Killarney.</P>
      <P>Government policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is as set out in a number of policy documents, most notably the Report of the Review Group On The Ambulance Service, which was published in 1993 and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group addressed, <i>inter alia</i>, the issue of the level of cover currently being provided by ambulance crews and made recommendations on how improvements might be made.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made by the Southern Health Board on the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the review group. This progress has been facilitated by special development funding from my Department to the board of in excess of £3 million in recent years. Much of this investment funding has been directed by the board towards improvements, on a phased basis, in the level of duty hours cover in all of the board's ambulance stations. The board's service plans continue to address the issue of increasing the level of in-station duty hours cover with a subsequent reduction of on-call hours cover.</P>
      <P>The Killarney service has been identified by the board as a first priority for the addition of extra crews to extend in-station duty cover and to reduce on-call cover. I understand that negotiations are currently taking place between the board and the staff side to agree the early implementation of new rostering arrangements to facilitate this.</P>
      <P>I further understand that the board is confident that agreement will be reached on the new rostering arrangements currently being discussed which will ensure that the service in the Killarney area will be improved in the most effective way, directing the additional resources to where they are most needed, to serve the community of Killarney.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government has pursued, and will continue to pursue, a policy of investment aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service including 24-hour cover, training, equipment and vehicles. I will, therefore, continue to provide additional resources for the continuing development of the emergency services nationally to ensure that those calling on the service continue to receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

      <P>I have not considered the introduction of a special tax incentive scheme in respect of therapy outside the State for children with disabilities nor have I discussed any such scheme with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. As it is not clear from the Deputy's question what the parameters of the scheme he has in mind would be and the type of therapy which he would envisage it would cover, I am unable to make any further comments on it at this point. My Department's general view, however, in relation to programmes provided in other countries is that, instead of sending children abroad at considerable expense, investment should be made in the services here in Ireland, incorporating, where appropriate, the elements of best practice from those services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a significant level of investment has been made in the health related support services for children with disabilities in recent years and the Government is committed to the ongoing development of the support services required by these children and their families.</P>

The procedures for admission of each category are set out in the Act.</P>
      <P>The Mental Health Bill, 1999, currently before the Oireachtas, will amend existing legislation for the admission of patients to psychiatric hospitals and units.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act, and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases.</P>
      <P>However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Mid-Western Health Board that, at present, it does not have any beds rented for use from the private sector.</P>

      <P>The potential for a conflict of interest amongst some members of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse arises because one of the members, currently on secondment to the commission, is an employee of one of the health agencies referred to in the vaccine report and a second member has a part-time consultancy appointment with the same body, hence the need to expand the membership of the current commission. This potential for conflict of interest only arose following the referral of the vaccine trials report to the commission because of the reference in the report to the health agency concerned, which, <i>prima facie</i>, had an involvement in one of the trials dealt with in the vaccines report.</P>
      <P>The proposed expansion of membership will facilitate the commission in investigating the vaccines report while avoiding giving rise to any potential for a conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>Once the commission's membership is expanded, a division of the investigation committee, to deal with the vaccines trials report, can be established without comprising either of the two existing members referred to above. That division of the investigation committee will then be empowered by the combined operation of section 11(6) of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, and the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001, to inquire into the vaccines report, to make determinations, to prepare a report and to furnish the report to the commission which will then be published.</P>

      <P>The provision of social security services throughout the 18 countries in the European Economic Area is co-ordinated by EC Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72. These regulations provide that an insured person in any EEA country is eligible to travel throughout the EEA and receive the same level of social security services as available to a citizen of each respective country.</P>
      <P>The E111 form entitles a person to emergency health care when travelling or staying temporarily in any country belonging to the EEA but not the cost of transporting persons back to Ireland. It will not cover any health care received outside the EEA. The E111 form is issued by the health board in which the person concerned resides and entitles a person to free emergency medical treatment. If a person does not have the form when receiving treatment, it may be necessary to pay for the treatment on the spot and claim for reimbursement at a later stage. Reimbursements will, however, be consistent with what citizens of the relevant country are themselves entitled to.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that there are a variety of healthcare systems throughout the EU which are delivered in different ways. It is imperative that prior to going to another EEA country that the person familiarises themselves on how to gain access to the healthcare system in the particular country. This information is available from the health boards, from various publications available from the Government Publications Office and from the European public information centres in Ireland. It is also important to be aware that the form E111 only entitles a person to emergency health treatment through the public health care system in the country concerned. Any treatment received from a private GP/clinic would not be covered by the E111 form and any costs incurred would have to be paid by the person.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health services to persons living in County Kilkenny rests with the South Eastern Health Board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the specific case referred to by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the location of certain specialties and the structure of consultant paediatric surgery posts has led to disagreement between the three children's hospitals in Dublin. In the absence of agreement on the structuring of a post, as recommended by Comhairle na nOspidéal in its report, Review of Paediatric Surgery Services, the approved permanent shared post has been filled by a general paediatric surgeon under temporary renewable contract. I am informed that elective specialist urology surgery has been suspended pending the resolution of this issue.</P>
      <P>I have recently written to Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Eastern Regional Health Authority with suggested minor modifications to the recommendations of An Chomhairle in relation to the structure and sessional commitments attaching to the specialist paediatric surgery posts in the three hospitals with a view to resolving the current impasse.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that these modifications will lead to a resolution of the current disagreement in the interest of improved service delivery and enhanced patient care. In the interim the Eastern Regional Health Authority will seek to ensure that all of those requiring surgery will have their needs met speedily.</P>

      <P>The report of the cardiovascular health strategy group &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts was launched in July 1999. It showed that our premature death rates from coronary heart disease for men and women are twice the EU average. The Department of Health and Children has set a medium term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. Building Healthier Hearts, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner.</P>
      <P>As a measure of the Government's commitment to the implementation of this report, structures were put in place at national, regional and local level to drive the implementation process. The structures take into account the need to sustain a co-ordinated programme and a high level of engagement over a long period. These structures include the establishment of a high level heart health task force, an expert advisory forum on cardiovascular health and an inter-divisional working group within my Department. These structures have been further complemented by regional co-ordinating committees under each health board.</P>
      <P>Some £12 million was provided to commence the implementation process in 2000. Each of the health boards received a financial allocation of £1 million, with the exception of the Eastern Regional Health Authority which received £3 million. The balance of £2 million was used to implement initiatives at a national level, mainly health promotion initiatives, cardiac technician training and the establishment of the pre hospital care council. At health board level, for 2000, most funding supported the recruitment of additional staff for community, hospital services as well as health promotion.</P>
      <P>In 2001, an additional £15 million has been made available for the continued implementation of the strategy. The following priority areas for service development by health boards for 2001 are being advanced. Cardiac rehabilitation has been identified as a priority this year and health boards have identified the recruitment of rehabilitation co-ordinators as a key area for development and phase two of the Ireland needs a change of heart campaign was launched in May 2001. This is a North-South collaboration, focusing on the positive aspects of physical activity; recruitment of hospital staff and development of facilities to treat cardiac patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> I am confident that over the coming years the necessary funding will be provided to allow us to achieve our goals in implementing the various actions set out in the strategy.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the increase in autism among young children in recent years; if he will address the fears that exist that the rate of occurrence is on an upward spiral and cannot be supported by current health services.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in recent years in the numbers of children being diagnosed with autism. Similar increases have also been experienced in other European countries and the USA. The diagnosis of autism is a clinical one, based on a variety of observations rather than a defined laboratory investigation. Hence the evolving concept of an &ldquo;autistic spectrum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability. There is increasing recognition of autism in Ireland and in other countries. What is not clear, however, is whether the increase is due to a greater awareness leading to better ascertainment or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, as part of the overall planning and development of services for persons with autism, the health boards have been obtaining <Col N="1346" /> additional information on the needs of this group in their regions and in particular in relation to those who require or will require specialist services. My Department is also working with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to establish an information system which will provide accurate data on the numbers of persons with autism and their service needs.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing additional residential, respite and day places for persons with autism in recent years as part of the overall ongoing development of services to persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability, specific funding has also been targeted to enhance the level of support available to children with autism and their families. Between 1998 and 2000, £5 million in additional funding was provided to expand the level of health related support services available to children with autism and their families. This would include assessment and diagnostic services, early intervention, pre-school services and outreach services to schoolchildren, respite and home support services. These services are provided by multi-disciplinary teams which include speech and language and occupational therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nursing, project workers and other support staff.</P>
    <P>In 2001 a further £3 million, increasing to £3.5 million in 2002, has been provided to further increase the level of health related support services to children with autism and those with an intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>However, health boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. This might include the purchase of additional sessions which may result in either the maintenance of the existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated for these services. It is a matter for each health board and the authority to determine what additional measures the service in their regions might undertake to facilitate this access. Health boards and other service providers have also been working together in the area of autism and intellectual disability to maximise the outcomes from recruitment drives both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Some work remains to be done in finalising the report which I commissioned from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in relation to workforce planning for therapists. I expect this will be completed shortly and I am making arrangements to publish the report in a few weeks time. Developments arising from the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report, together with some initial measures which my <Col N="1347" /> Department has already taken to increase the number of training places for certain allied health professions, will provide for an increasing number of trained personnel for the services.</P>
    <P>Another measure which has been taken to assist parents in this area is section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001, which amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of educational psychological assessment and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>
    <P>Finally, I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the ongoing development of the services required to support persons with autism and their families.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is eligible for in-patient services subject to statutory charges. These services may be provided directly by the health board in one of its own hospitals, or in another publicly funded hospital, or by way of a contracting out arrangement between the health board and a private institution. Alternatively, one can opt for private treatment; all persons, including medical card holders, who opt for private treatment are liable for any expenses they incur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Charges can be made under two sets of regulations in respect of long-stay or extended care. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges. In practice, however, persons in health board long stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the board meets the cost of all of the person's health needs and, thus, the person ceases to qualify for a medical card in accordance with criteria laid down in section 45 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
    <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 and 381 together.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council has been allocated some £27 million in non-national road grants for 2001 which represents an increase of 15% compared to the initial 2000 allocation. The council enjoys the largest grant among county councils; this exceeds the next highest grant by some £7 million. Since 1997 Cork County Council's grant has increased by 80%.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Cork County Council was one of ten county councils selected for special grant aid this year to support housing and other related developments. Under this new grants scheme, over £5 million has been committed to Cork County Council in the 2001-04 period for road infrastructure, of which £375,000 was allocated in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining non-national road grant allocations for 2001, the objective has been to resource all local authorities, including Cork County Council, appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. This process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement conditions, traffic volumes, length of road net<Col N="1353" /> work and suitability in relation to criteria for EU co-financing. This multiplicity of criteria, together with the variable impact from year to year of project specific schemes, necessarily entails divergence between local authorities in grants per kilometre under the non-national roads programme.</P>
    <P>A submission from Cork County Council dated 10 May 2001 seeking additional funding under the restoration programme is at present being examined in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996, require a landlord to register details of rented units with the relevant local authority, to update the information once <Col N="1354" /> yearly and to pay registration fees. Local authorities are responsible for the enforcement of the regulations and it is, therefore, the responsibility of Dublin Corporation to ensure compliance with the provisions of these regulations by landlords of properties located within the corporation's functional area. I am anxious to see an improved level of compliance with the provisions of the regulations and, to this end, authorities, including Dublin Corporation, have been regularly urged by my Department to take all steps open to them to secure compliance by landlords with the regulations. The income from registration fees is designed to assist authorities to meet the cost of their registration and enforcement activities.</P>
      <P>The scope for involvement of an environmental health officer under the registration regulations is limited. However, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993, impose a number of requirements on landlords in relation to structural matters, sanitary, heating and cooking facilities, electricity and gas installations, ventilation, and maintenance of common areas, yards and forecourts. Where an inspection by an environmental health officer or other local authority official reveals a breach of any of these requirements, the local authority may serve a notice on the landlord specifying the matters that must be remedied to ensure compliance. If non-compliance continues, the local authority may institute court proceedings against the landlord. If convicted, the landlord may be fined up to £1,000 and up to £100 for each day of a continuing offence.</P>
      <P>Where a tenancy is governed by a lease, a standard term will normally require the tenant to keep the garden tidy and well tended. The Litter Pollution Act, 1997, imposes certain obligations on owners of residences let in two or more dwellings, if visible from a public place, and on occupiers of all dwellings facing on to public roads in reduced speed limit areas to keep land and adjoining footpaths free of litter. The enforcement of this legislation is also a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I have no proposals to amend the standards regulations to insert a provision dealing specifically with the tending of gardens.</P>

      <P>EU requirements on driver licensing limit the scope of a licence for cars and light vans to the driving of vehicles &ndash; other than motorcycles, mopeds, work vehicles or land tractors &ndash; with a design gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3,500 kg and having passenger accommodation for not more than eight persons.</P>
      <P>These requirements are reflected in Irish driver licensing regulations which provide for a category B licence in relation to the latter vehicles and for a separate driver licence and testing regime &ndash; category D1 &ndash; in relation to vehicles with passenger accommodation for more than eight and not more than 16, persons.</P>
      <P>Persons wishing to drive minibuses should therefore apply for a category D1 licence. A further public service vehicle licence is only required for persons driving these or other vehicles for hire or reward.</P>

      <P>Under the disabled persons grant scheme local authorities may pay a grant for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to a house to meet the needs of a disabled member of the household. I have improved the terms and conditions of this scheme on three occasions since 1997 with the effective maximum grant now £16,000, double what it was in 1997. I have also introduced an effective maximum grant of £10,000 towards the purchase of a new house specially adapted for a disabled person. Previously the maximum grant available for a disabled person purchasing or building a new house was £3,000 under the new house grant scheme. The difference between the £10,000 new house maximum and the £16,000 maximum for adaptation works reflects the fact that it is more costly to provide for the needs of a disabled person when adapting an existing house than when building a new house.</P>
      <P>In the case of a private house, the grant may now cover 90% of the approved cost of the works, compared to two thirds in 1997, while the full cost of the works are covered in the case of a local authority house. Where applicants face a difficulty funding their element of the cost of the works there are a number of options open to local authorities to assist, for example, by funding the cost of the works under the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing or by advancing a local authority house improvement loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are a number of other targeted options currently available to assist vulnerable groups such as the disabled to secure neces<Col N="1360" /> sary improvements works to their houses. These include the essential repairs grant scheme, the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme, local authority home improvement loans and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly.</P>

      <P>The compensation code for compulsory purchase of land, including land required for road development provides for the payment of compensation by local authorities for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed CPO. It is a basic principle that landowners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible. Compensation is composed of a number of elements. The fundamental point to be borne in mind is that landowners get the market value of the land. There is also provision for compensation for disturbance, severance and injurious affection and which in certain circumstances would exceed the land element of the total compensation package. In addition, accommodation works such as underpasses are also catered for. Where a dispute arises about compensation the matter can be referred to an independent arbitrator for decision.</P>
      <P>The IFA has published proposals for reform of the arrangements for compulsory acquisition of land. In the context of the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to the &ldquo;fair and efficient implementation of compulsory purchase orders&rdquo; the proposals have been discussed by the IFA, my Department and other relevant agencies, including the National Roads Authority. As these discussions are ongoing, the Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate to elaborate at this stage.</P>

Because of the scale and complexity of the Act, and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date, I have made three commencement orders bringing a number of Parts of the Act into force. These include Part II on development plans, Part V on the supply of housing, Part IX on strategic development zones, Part XIV on the acquisition of land, Part XX which amends the Roads Act, 1993 and Part XVI on the licensing of outdoor events. Regulations are currently being finalised by my Department which will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act into force.

      <P>Postal voting is confined to members of the gardaí, whole-time members of the Defence Forces, Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses, electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or disability and electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day. Full-time students registered at home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State are also eligible to apply for a postal vote.</P>
      <P>With the exception of members of the Defence Forces and Irish diplomats posted abroad and their spouses, electors who are eligible for but not already included in the postal voters list, may apply for entry in a supplement to the list which is published prior to each poll. The latest date for receipt of applications by registration authorities for inclusion in the supplement is the date of the dissolution of the Dáil at a general election or the date of the making of an order appointing polling day at other polls.</P>
      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, provides for a number of new arrangements in this area, including an extension of the supplement facility for postal voters to members of the Defence Forces and diplomats and an extension by two days of the time limit within which an application for entry to the postal voters supplement can be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 405 and 414 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 28 of the Electoral Act, 1992, local authorities are responsible for making a polling scheme dividing a county or county borough into polling districts and appointing a polling place for each polling district for the purpose of holding elections. Polling schemes are drafted in accordance with the Electoral (Polling Scheme) Regulations, 1964, and a memorandum for the guidance of local authorities issued by my Department. In relation to the size of polling districts, that advice states that polling districts should be of reasonable size with a general aim of districts with 700 to 1000 electors in rural areas. Where polling districts of less than 350 electors are proposed, explanations are sought from local authorities.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, however, the number and location of polling stations and the allocation of electors to them is a matter for the appropriate returning officer.</P>

The remaining three were assigned to An Bord Pleanála. The four Dublin local authorities indicated that they would offer positions to nine of them on a contract basis. Local authorities generally are now making arrangements for their appointment on a two year contract basis. So far three of the nine planners have indicated that they will take up positions on the basis of the offers made to them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 415, 418 and 421 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bereavement grant &ndash; formerly death grant &ndash; is a payment based on PRSI contri<Col N="1367" /> butions, designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses.</P>
    <P>The grant is payable on the death of an insured person; the wife or husband of an insured person; the widow or widower of an insured person; a child under age 18, or under age 22 if in full-time education, where either parent or the person that the child normally lives with satisfies the PRSI contribution conditions; a contributory pensioner; the wife or husband of a contributory pensioner; the qualified adult of a contributory pensioner, including those who would be a qualified adult but are getting another social welfare payment, for example, carer's allowance; a qualified child; and an orphan in receipt of orphan's contributory allowance.</P>
    <P>The bereavement grant was totally redesigned in 1999 to provide for a five-fold increase in the rate of payment from £100 to the current rate of £500. In addition, the payment was extended to include self-employed PRSI contributors and those covered by the modified rate of social insurance in addition to those paying full-rate PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>A person who has insufficient PRSI contributions will not qualify for a bereavement grant. However, there are other measures in place that are designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement, for example, the payment of six weeks social welfare following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse.</P>
    <P>Budget 2000 provided for the introduction of a once-off payment of £1,000 payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow(er's) contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the supplementary welfare allowance, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income.</P>
    <P>These payments, known as exceptional needs payments, may be made towards funeral expenses where it is established that there is an inability to meet the costs by the family concerned.</P>
    <P>Any further developments in these arrangements would have expenditure implications and could only be considered in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance. The relevant legislation specifies the circumstances in which a person is, or is not, deemed to be available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>In applying the legislation, deciding officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality and to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of existing labour market opportunities. Any person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. Persons employed in the educational sector are treated in the same way and are expected to meet the same requirements as other claimants in that regard.</P>
      <P>The number of persons whose stated employment was in the education sector and who qualified for unemployment payments in the months of June, July and August was 4,710 in 1999 and 2,947 in 2000. The number of such claims disallowed in the same period was 271 in 1999 and 566 in 2000.</P>
      <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal this decision to the social welfare appeals office.

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over. The other free schemes, including the free electricity or gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The Review of the Free Schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin in April last year, noted that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
      <P>The Review of the Free Schemes examined the many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups, including widows and widowers using social inclusion objectives as the criteria for decision. It considered that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or disability.</P>
      <P>Widow/ers who are not living alone may experience social exclusion but they are not groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The review noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes. Overall the proposals in the review are being examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in 1993 with the aim of helping those who were long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force either as employees or in self-employment.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have been unemployed or in receipt of certain relevant payments for at least 12 months. Currently there are over 37,000 participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self-employment options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> Among the recommendations in a recent evaluation report on the scheme was that, in the light of the current tight labour market situation the scheme should be refocussed on the longer-term unemployed. I agree with the recommendations in the report concerning an increased level of training, advice, support and mentoring for those participating in the scheme and my Department is actively pursuing these issues. In this context I will shortly introduce a code of practice aimed at employers, participants and the Department as recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>The report will form the basis for future developments of the scheme and will help my Department ensure that it reflects the needs of the labour market and also the needs of the client groups at whom it is targeted. To this end, my Department has also embarked on a wide-ranging series of consultations with the social partners regarding the future of the scheme. There are no plans to change the criteria required to qualify for participation in the scheme to apply it to the category referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>To qualify for participation an application must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months &ndash; 156 days &ndash; immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
      <P>The focus of the scheme has always been on those who have been out of employment for some time and who find it difficult otherwise to improve their skills. The scheme is not intended to meet the immediate needs of people who are made redundant. There are no plans at present to change the rules of the scheme in the manner proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 426 and 427 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a rent supplement a person in the first instance must satisfy a means test. A health board must also satisfy itself that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need, that the property being rented is suitable to those needs and that a bona fide tenancy exists between the applicant and their landlord.</P>
      <P>A health board may consider that a property is not suited to the applicant's needs if the accommodation does not comply with the Housing Regulations (Standards for Rented Housing), 1993. It is not a requirement that the landlord is registered with the relevant local authority. Only a minority of rented property is registered with local authorities and such a requirement would inevitably lead to a restriction in choice of accommodation for applicants for SWA.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for enforcing both the standards and registration regulations rests with the local authorities. With regard to value for money, each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, single persons, couples, lone parents with one child etc. as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
      <P>Health boards must also satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person in receipt of rent supplement has been assisted in securing accommodation by way of a deposit and moves location, the community welfare officer, will not continue payment <Col N="1374" /> of the supplement until the deposit is returned to the CWO. In some instances the CWO will contact the landlord directly to arrange for the return of the deposit.</P>
    <P>With regard to future arrangements, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance to be operated by the local authorities, as the Deputy may be aware. One of the objectives of the new scheme will be to ensure that a full range of housing options is available to people with long-term housing needs. The priority is to provide housing solutions rather than social welfare solutions to meet the housing needs of people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>Details on expenditure relating to deposits for rent are not available prior to 2000 as the administration of SWA in the then EHB area was not fully computerised until mid-1999.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on rent deposits in the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; formerly EHB &ndash; area in 2000 was £1,210,746, of which £359,998 was in respect of the South-Western Area Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 430 and 432 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. This will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for the carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment.</P>
      <P>The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rate of payment, I made provision for substantial rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66. This brings the maximum rate for a carer under 66 years of age to £88.50 per week and the rate for a carer aged over 66 years to £98.50 per week. It is not possible to estimate the cost of increasing the rate of carer's allowance in line with the national minimum wage rate. The carer's allowance is a weekly income support payment that supports someone who is providing full-time care whereas the minimum wage rate is based on an hourly rate of £4.40 and not on a weekly rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. These income disregards already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. As I announced in my budget speech, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation, whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider that abolition of the means test, at a cost in the region of £180 million, is the best way to support carers or the best use of resources.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others. The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. Carer's allowance is paid by my Department and as with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other forms of financial assistance referred to by the Deputy are catered for under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA <Col N="1377" />&ndash; scheme. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
    <P>The SWA scheme consists of a number of different types of payment, including supplements which may be paid in respect of such needs as diet or heating requirements. Social welfare or health board recipients who have a special dietary requirement arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for a diet supplement payment under the SWA scheme. Entitlement to payment is determined by health boards by reference to standard costed diets. The supplement paid is in respect of the additional cost of the special diet over and above the amount a person would be expected to pay for a normal diet.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there is a facility available through the SWA scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.</P>
    <P>Under the SWA scheme, a health board may also make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments, ENPs. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, such as carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to provide assistance by means of an ENP. Also, the guidelines issued to the health boards by my Department on ENPs state that a single payment for the purpose of replacement of clothing and footwear may be considered in special circumstances, such as where the claimant or one of his dependants is suffering from a chronic ailment or serious disease which gives rise to a need for extra clothing or special footwear from time to time.</P>
    <P>Under legislation an assessment of all means and needs must be carried out to determine entitlement to SWA. There is no automatic right of entitlement to an ENP. They are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>An application for assistance under the terms of the SWA scheme by way of a supplement or an ENP in respect of special dietary, clothing or heating needs may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to extending pension cover to as many categories as possible and as a result more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme. Measures already introduced include the reduction in the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten and the payment of a special half rate pension for those with pre-53 insurance contributions who cannot satisfy the average contribution test. <i>Pro rata</i> pensions are also available for people with mixed rate insurance records.</P>
      <P>These measures are making it easier for people, particularly women, with reduced or broken insurance records to receive a contributory pension. Specific issues in relation to the operation of the marriage bar in the public service are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>At present it is estimated that about 90% of women over 65 years of age are receiving a social welfare payment. Of these 87% have a payment in their own right with about 62% of those who have a payment receiving one based on their PRSI record. While recognising that the social insurance system cannot cover all gaps in pension coverage, nevertheless, as I indicated in my speech on the budget more needs to be done in this area.</P>
      <P>In particular, the existing homemaker's scheme, which is intended to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives, is being reviewed. This and other issues, including the cost and administrative implications, are being considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions which is being undertaken by a working group comprising officials of my Department and the Department of Finance. It is expected that the phase 2 report will be available for consideration in the context of budget 2002.</P>
      <P>The Government has also decided to increase the rate of the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age to the full old age non-contributory pension rate. A major step towards this objective was taken in budget 2001 by providing an increase of £15 per week in the full rate qualified adult allowance.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the report of the PPF working group which is currently examining the issues of administrative individualisation, arrangements will be put in place so that part of the pension can be paid directly to the qualified adult as a homemaker's pension. This measure, when combined with the proposed increase in the qualified adult allowance, will benefit many women who cannot qualify for a payment in their own right.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is a weekly payment of £6 per week made to people receiving certain social welfare payments who are residing alone. The scheme, which normally applied to people aged 66 years of age or over, was extended, with effect from 4 April 2001, to persons who are receiving disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind person's pension or unemployability supplement.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have already been undertaken by my Department to ensure that recipients of these payments are made fully aware of their potential entitlement to this allowance.</P>
      <P>The extension of the living alone allowance to these recipients was advertised in all provincial, national, daily and Sunday papers in the week commencing 6 April. A freephone number was also provided from 9 April to 12 April 2001, whereby customers could obtain further information concerning this allowance.</P>
      <P>All recipients of blind person's pension and unemployability supplement were written to directly and advised of their potential entitlement to the living alone allowance.</P>
      <P>All disability allowance recipients who are paid through the post office were notified of the living alone allowance in their new personalised payable order books with effect from April 2001.</P>
      <P>All invalidity pension recipients who are paid through the post office will be notified of the allowance in their new personalised payable order books which will issue from 2 August 2001.</P>
      <P>Recipients of disability allowance and invalidity pension who are paid by electronic fund transfer will in the next few weeks receive a direct mailshot. This will include details on the qualifying conditions for the allowance and advice on how to apply.</P>
      <P>Details of all social welfare budget changes, including those to the living alone allowance, were advertised on Aertel.</P>
      <P>In the case of new claimants of disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind person's pension and unemployability supplement, their entitlement to living alone allowance will be examined in conjunction with their primary claim entitlement.</P>
      <P>As of 1 June 2001, just under 7,000 new applications for the living alone allowance have been received. In addition, anyone submitting a late claim for this allowance will have their payment backdated to 4 April 2001 or to the date of their primary claim entitlement as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The people concerned have been in receipt of old age non-contributory pension since in one case 1986 and in the other case 1991. Old age non-contributory pension is a means-tested payment and is subject to periodic reviews.</P>
      <P>The pension entitlements of the people concerned were reviewed in 1993. Their means were assessed at that time at £4,790 per annum derived from British pensions and income from a holding. This was equivalent to £46.06 each per week.</P>
      <P>Based on these means, the current weekly rates of old age pension entitlement would be £58.50 including over-80 allowance and £53.50 per week respectively, or a combined payment of £112 per week.</P>
      <P>Following a recent review, their current means derived from the updated value of their British pensions has been assessed at £7,616 approximately or £73.22 each per week. This results in pension entitlements of £32.50 including over 80 allowance and £27.50 per week. The couple concerned have an opportunity to respond to the assessment before a formal decision is made in their case. That decision can also be appealed to the social welfare appeals office if they are not satisfied with the outcome.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones as and when these zones are introduced.</P>
      <P>The duration of the scheme was 26 weeks until, as announced in this year's budget, I extended the fuel season to 29 weeks. The three week extension is being implemented in full this year.</P>
      <P>This is achieved by extending the end of the 2000-01 fuel season by two weeks in April 2001 and by bringing forward the commencement of next winter's fuel season by one week in October. The next fuel season will operate for 29 weeks.</P>
      <P>The butter voucher scheme to which the Deputy refers was operated under EU legislation which provided for the supply of butter to social assistance beneficiaries and their dependants at subsidised rates. The subsidy was provided by means of vouchers, the printing and distribution of which was arranged by my Department on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Agriculture Council decided, on foot of a proposal from the EU Commission, to terminate the butter voucher scheme at the end of 1999. As this scheme was not renewed by the EU it accordingly ceased to operate with effect from 31 December 1999 and the closing date for <Col N="1383" /> the exchange of butter vouchers issued in 1999 was 29 February 2000.</P>

      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy relates to a situation where a person failed to qualify for disability allowance on means grounds, on the basis of her husband's income. I understand that she has appealed this decision on the basis that weekly maintenance payments paid out by her husband are not deducted from the means assessment.</P>
      <P>The assessment of maintenance payments for means-tested social assistance purposes is currently being examined by my Department. On foot of a proposal in the review of the one-parent family payment I included a provision in this year's Social Welfare Act for the introduction of new improved arrangements for assessing maintenance payments in the case of one parent family payment. This measure, which costs £1.3 million in a full year, will benefit some 4,000 people by an average of £15 per week.</P>
      <P>The question of extending these new arrangements to other means-tested payments and of disregarding maintenance payments being made by claimants of social welfare payments or their spouses is currently being examined. Any further changes in this area would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant must satisfy a means test and must live alone or only with qualified dependants or with a <Col N="1384" /> carer or with a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a with person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right. If the household includes a person who is in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit or occupational injury benefit then that household will not qualify for a fuel allowance. The benefit recipient could qualify for a £3 smokeless fuel allowance if they are residing in one of the specified smokeless fuel areas and are on benefit for more than three months.</P>
    <P>People who qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory pension, unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment are accepted as satisfying the means test. The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment. In general, earnings received from a health board as a home help are disregarded either fully or partially in the means tests for those primary weekly payments.</P>
    <P>There is a separate means test for receipt of fuel allowance in the case of contributory pensioners, such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensioners because those pensions are paid without a means test. A person may have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings or investments of up to £30,000 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance. The income of the qualified adult is assessable as means for the purpose of entitlement to a fuel allowance but home help earnings from a health board are disregarded in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The additional income limit of £30 will be increased to £40 from October 2001.</P>

      <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities. My role is to provide advice to them in the exercise of their functions. This is reinforced in the recently enacted Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage. Under the legislation, responsibility for the making of an addition to, or <Col N="1385" /> a deletion from, a record of protected structures rests with the elected representatives. In this regard, I understand that, in drafting its 1998 development plan, South Dublin County Council decided to delete the property referred to by the Deputy from its list of protected structures. This was done without particular reference to my Department. I am advised that the owner subsequently secured planning permission to demolish the buildings. This application was not the subject of a referral to my Department. My officials have been in contact with the owner's agent seeking to have those items of interest salvaged from the site, despite this not being a condition of the planning permission.</P>
    <P>In this instance, it is clear that the planning authority has taken a decision, which I regret, although my officials have tried to persuade the owner to preserve some of its heritage value. The Deputy will appreciate that, given the decision by the local elected representatives and the fact that my main role is advisory, I do not propose taking any further action in the circumstances of this case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 to 448, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To minimise the threat of foot and mouth disease throughout the country, I decided to close the six national parks, all nature reserves as well as the national monuments and historic properties under my control from 28 February last. My Department has since been engaged in ongoing consultation with the expert advisory group established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, regarding the possible re-opening of sites on a phased basis. Following the advice of the expert group, I decided to re-open all national parks, including the Burren National Park, to visitors with effect from 11 May 2001. Visitors to the park are requested to behave responsibly to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease and to ensure that they clean and disinfect their footwear and <Col N="1387" /> keep dogs under control at all times. They should also avoid direct contact with susceptible animals.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 355 of 21 November 2001, I had instructed my officials at that time to open exploratory talks with Clare County Council to establish in general what options may exist in the whole north Clare area in regard to appropriate facilities for public access to the Burren National Park, and for control of that access, as a priority. These talks took place on 22 December 2000, following which I decided to appoint external professional consultants to examine all possible sites. The process of appointing these consultants is under way at present.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the consultants' report, I will consider what measures are required in relation to visitor facilities, including access points, signage, promotion of the park and the provision of guide services.</P>

      <P>There is a very large amount of knowledge about salmon in Ireland, but more limited hard scientific data on salmon population numbers. In evaluating sites for proposal as salmon special areas of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive, my Department, having consulted widely in the matter, has used the best information available under the following headings: sites of importance because of the size of the salmon population; sites important for spring salmon, which are genetically distinct and more threatened; good geographic range, that is, rivers from around Ireland; reasonable prospects regarding water quality and physical condition; and where appropriate, significant presence in sites of other habitats or species listed under the Habitats Directive.</P>

      <P>There is no available data on the number and location of archaeolog<Col N="1389" /> ical sites which have been destroyed in the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>Under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, the Record of Monuments and Places was established. This places an onus on the owner-occupier of a recorded monument to give two months notice of any intended works at or in relation to the monument. Details of the setting up of the record in each county was notified in both national and relevant local newspapers and copies of the record are available in county council offices and libraries. In addition, under the Planning Acts, the local authorities refer development applications, which are likely to impact on recorded monuments, to my Department for advice and recommendations. Similarly, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development refer applications for grant aid to my Department where the proposed development might impact on archaeological sites and monuments whilst under the REP scheme, which has over 40,000 participating farmers, protection of monuments on farmland is actively encouraged.</P>
      <P>In a further initiative by my Department, a code of practice has been agreed with the National Roads Authority in relation to mitigation of impacts on sites and monuments from road construction and further codes are being discussed with other large scale developers, such as the Irish Concrete Federation, Bord Gáis and the Irish Ports Association.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of successful prosecutions in recent years for breaches of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-94. These range from actual damage to sites, interference with sites without the appropriate licence and theft of artefacts. At present there is one case involving damage to a site in the courts system while there are also a number of civil actions being taken for recovery of stolen artefacts.</P>
      <P>The Garda is also involved in a number of criminal investigations. In cases where there are reports of damage to monuments, the gardaí are asked to investigate but it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide on whether or not to prosecute.</P>
      <P>In the specific case referred to by the Deputy, officials from my Department were informed of the location of the damaged monuments on 24 May 2001 and inspected it on 28 May 2001. Two ring forts have been levelled, field boundaries removed and the ground ploughed and seeded since the site was last inspected. My officials are currently reviewing the inspector's report and will then decide on appropriate follow-up action.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments Acts are regarded generally as being quite effective compared with other jurisdictions but I want to further improve the protective provisions and, in this regard, my officials are at an advanced stage of drafting a consolidated and improved act governing national monuments.</P>

      <P>Development applications that impact on archaeological sites and monuments are referred by the relevant local authority to my Department for comment and recommendation. No application in relation to the proposed development referred to by the Deputy has been forwarded to my Department. Inquiries with the planning authority indicate that there is no formal application for this site as yet. I am, therefore, not in a position to comment on what archaeological implications, if any, might arise in relation to this proposal.</P>
      <P>My Department's publication, Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage, sets out broad principles for protecting archaeological sites and monuments. Part III of this publication outlines the principles for the protection of the archaeological heritage. In summary, they state that the archaeological heritage is a non-renewable resource and the first option in all circumstances must be non-destructive investigation and study. Furthermore, there should always be a presumption in favour of avoiding development impacts on the archaeological heritage so that preservation, <i>in situ</i>, is the preferred approach. This applies to all archaeological sites and monuments; no distinction is made between the likes of a burial ground and, for example, a ring fort.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is a children's burial ground, which is a recorded monument, in the area and my officials will of course consider carefully any application for development in or near this monument.</P>

I expect the commission's report to be available before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is under such a system, if accepted, that the inclusion of the area in question, that is, Ballycroy, County Mayo, would be considered. Pending the receipt of the commission's recommendations it is not proposed to examine the case for the inclusion of that area in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 22 March 2001 to Parliamentary Question No. 124. My Department has very recently received an estimate of the cost of improving the road, referred to by the Deputy, from Mayo County <Col N="1393" /> Council. The road will be taken into account in the context of other applications received and the moneys available to me, when applications under scéim na mbóithre áise are next being considered.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a proposed gas and discharge pipeline is to traverse Sruwaddacon Bay which is a special protection area, and the receiving gas and condensate terminal associated toxic runoff is to be located adjacent to the Carrowmore Lake special areas of conservation in County Mayo.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the proposed Corrib natural gas field development project, including the gas reception and treatment facilities at Bellanaboy Bridge Terminal and the associated pipelines, etc.</P>
      <P>The proposed Bellanaboy Bridge Terminal &ndash; gas reception and treatment facilities &ndash; at Bellagelly South, Pollatomish, Belmullet was the subject of a Planning Application &ndash; No. 00/2934 &ndash; to Mayo County Council on 17 November 2000. I understand the council requested further information in connection with this application from Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited on 12 January 2001. On 30 April 2001 the company submitted a new planning application &ndash; No. 01/900 &ndash; to the county council for the gas reception and treatment facilities at the proposed Bellanaboy Bridge Terminal. My Department is considering this application and a submission will be made to the county council in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources consulted my Department about the application by the company for a foreshore licence in connection with the offshore aspects of the proposed development. As a result my Department made three submissions, between November 2000 and March 2001, to that Department on the impact of the proposed development on the built and natural heritage. The pipeline, as it approaches the shore, runs through Broadhaven Bay candidate special area of conservation &ndash; cSAC No. 472 &ndash; and thence through Glenamoy Bog Complex candidate special area of conservation &ndash; cSAC No. 500. Srawaddacon Bay, which is located within the former candidate special area of conservation, is also a special protection area. The environmental impact statement submitted for this proposal fails to note or mention the special protection area designation. While my Department is in general agreement with the preferred sea route of the proposed pipeline, it is important that impacts from the proposed development are kept to a minimum. In order to maintain the conservation value of the candidate special areas of conservation/special protection area, my Department recommended that the proposed development be subject to cer<Col N="1394" /> tain conditions. With regard to the location of the discharge outfall, my Department recommended that permission be refused to locate it within the Broadhaven Bay candidate special area of conservation and that an alternative acceptable location be identified. I understand the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has asked the company to submit a supplementary report which will address certain deficiencies in the documentation submitted in support of the foreshore licence application. My Department awaits receipt of the supplementary report and expects that it will address the concerns raised in its submissions to that Department.</P>

      <Quest>if the framework documents will be available by the end of June 2001; the amount by which farmers will have to de-stock; and the way in which these farmers will be compensated for the loss of ewe premiums and for the loss of the lambs if they have to de-stock.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of commonage framework plans being carried out jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is well advanced. Work has been completed on plans covering almost 350,000 hectares of commonage, or 71% of the total. For upland commonage in the six western counties to which the interim 30% de-stocking was applied, work is 90% complete. We are not in a position to publish plans until the plans have been completed for all these commonages. Due to delays arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis this is not likely to be achieved by the end of June 2001.</P>
      <P>Under the commonage framework plans each area is individually assessed to establish its ecologically sustainable stocking levels. Since conditions will vary from place to place, it is not possible to give a general statement as to the amount, if any, each farmer will have to de-stock. In the six western counties already subject to 30% de-stocking, the framework plans may justify a restoration of quota in particular areas, while requiring greater de-stocking in others.</P>
      <P>One option for farmers who have to de-stock is to be compensated through REPS. Those who are not in REPS will be compensated through the complementary national compensation scheme to be administered by my Department. Compensation through this scheme will be based on actual losses incurred because of the de-stocking, including the loss of premia and the value of sales.</P>

      <P>Section 5 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, specifies that a court may, in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution, grant a decree of divorce in respect of a marriage where the court is satisfied that at the date of the institution of the proceedings, the spouses have lived apart from one another for a period of, or periods amounting to, at least four years during the previous five years; there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses, and such provision as the court considers proper having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the <Col N="1396" /> spouses and any dependant members of the family.</P>
      <P>An EC regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses, which came into force in Ireland on 1 March of this year, does not affect the conditions outlined above, which must exist if a court in this jurisdiction is to grant a divorce decree. The EC regulation relates to the issue of the recognition and enforcement in one EU member state of divorces granted in other EU states.</P>
      <P>The prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas was obtained in June 1999 in order that Ireland could participate in the adoption and application of the proposal for the EC regulation. The subsequent decision of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Council to adopt the regulation was taken on the basis of unanimity, not qualified majority voting as seems to be implied in the newspaper article to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>The provision of specific specialist services for conditions such as ADD-ADHD continues to be reviewed in the context of similar services being available in the general community and the relative need for such services for prisoners.</P>
      <P>A recent survey of the health status of prisoners, which was conducted by the Department of Health Promotion at NUI Galway, found that only 4% of the prison population had ever had a diagnosis of ADD or ADHD. These figures indicate that the prevalence of this disease is relatively low compared to other illnesses within this group of people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 and 480 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, responsibility for the provision of legal services, including the location of law centres, is a matter for the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Mount Street premises was the original head office for the Legal Aid Board and that this premises was retained by the board as a law centre when, arising out of an increase in staff numbers, its head office moved to its present location in St. Stephen's Green House in October 1994. I am informed that the board decided to retain the Mount Street premises, on a temporary basis, as a law centre pending the selection of a premises for a city centre law centre which had been approved on 4 March 1994 by my predecessor, former Deputy Taylor, then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, who had responsibility for civil legal aid at that time.</P>
      <P>In relation to arrangements for the present clientele of the Mount Street law centre, the Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, an applicant for legal services may apply to any law centre in the State, regardless of his or her home address. In this regard, law centres serve no particular catchment area and applicants from the greater Dublin area may apply for legal services at any of the Dublin law centres convenient to them.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I can inform the Deputy that the present clientele of the Mount Street law centre come from a variety of areas of both the north and south of Dublin city and county and that only 37 out of 442 people who are current clients actually live in what might be regarded as the Mount Street area. For the Deputy's information, I have included details of the postal districts where those clients live in the following table.</P>
      <P>I should also mention to the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board operates a private practitioner scheme. Under this scheme applicants are given the option of either going to a private solicitor of their choice from the panel of private practitioners or of having their names added to the waiting list at the law centre. I am informed that there are solicitors from the south city and south county area on the panel.</P>
      <P>Finally, I can inform the Deputy that, in view of his interest in this matter, I have requested the board to examine the needs of the Dublin south-east area, as part of its ongoing review of the delivery of legal services.</P>

      <P>The limits currently in place under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, for gaming are 2.5p for stakes and 50p for prizes. The report of the interdepartmental review group on the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, recommended an increase in these limits in conjunction with the implementation of new legislation to replace the 1956 Act. The preparation of this legislation is being considered at present within the context of the overall legislative programme within my Department.</P>
      <P>The limits on stakes and prizes which will apply following the introduction of the euro will be the euro equivalent of 0.03 and 0.63 or 3 and 63 cents respectively. Legislation will not be required in this context.</P>

      <P>On 31 May 2001, the Reception and Integration Agency of my Department, which is responsible for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of direct provision, was engaged in contracts for service with 66 proprietors-operators in respect of the provision of accommodation at 71 centres throughout the State. In addition, in the case of State-owned accommodation facilities, two man<Col N="1408" /> agement and catering companies operate seven facilities under contract on behalf of the Reception and Integration Agency.</P>
      <P>The period of the contracts in question range from five months to 24 months. Some 63 of these contracts were entered into during 2000 and the remainder in 2001.</P>
      <P>On the costs to the State of providing accommodation for asylum seekers, under the system of direct provision the rates payable to the owners/operators of hostels, hotels, guesthouses, convents and other premises in use for full board accommodation is subject primarily to the prevailing commercial market conditions. In recent weeks, the amounts paid to accommodation providers in respect of properties procured by the RIA are in the range of £140 to £175 per adult per week inclusive of VAT. For most of 2000, the amounts paid tended to be in the range of £147 to £189 per adult per week, inclusive of VAT. Within this broad range the amount paid to individual centre owners-operators is contingent on the overall standard of the accommodation and the facilities provided.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1 January to 31 May 2001, a total of £16.6 million was paid to owners-operators in respect of the provision of full board facilities for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>The details in respect of the proprietorsoperators of the accommodation in use are as follows:</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board has sole responsibility for the provision of legal services, including the numbers and grades of staff assigned to each law centre. I can confirm to the Deputy that the full complement of staff <Col N="1412" /> requested by the board has been sanctioned by my Department.</P>
      <P>The number of staff assigned by the board to each law centre during the past five years is set out in tabular form at Table A.</P>
      <P>The criteria used to determine financial eligibility under the Civil Legal Aid Act, which have been in existence since 1995, are under review in my Department. This review, which is being conducted in consultation with the Legal Aid Board, is nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter shortly. The current limits are set out in tabular form at Table B.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that the number of applicants for legal services, per year, for the five year period ending on 31 December 2000 &ndash; 2000 is the most recent complete year for which figures are available &ndash; is as follows:</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a capital and staffing grant scheme for community based-not for profit groups is part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme, 2000 to 2006. Under the capital grant scheme, works of a capital nature would be eligible for consideration, including, for example, renovations, building work and child care equipment costs. Under the staffing grant scheme, salary costs for child care staff working directly with children would be eligible for consideration.</P>
      <P>To date, no application for funding under the capital grant for the community-based-not for profit groups scheme from the community groups in question has been received by my Department's equal opportunities child care section.</P>
      <P>Applications for funding towards staffing costs were received on 20 November 2000 from the first group in question and on 15 November 2000 from the second group. I understand from my officials that both of these applications were forwarded for technical assessment to Area Development Management Limited in November 2000. To date, this application has not been submitted to me for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for funding are considered by a programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department. The programme appraisal committee makes a recommendation on each application following an initial assessment carried out by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of my Department. The assessment of applications is based on material supplied by the <Col N="1418" /> applicant in the original application or any additional material requested. No single factor determines the outcome of any application. As outlined in the general guidelines for funding measures which are available from my Department, applications are assessed according to the following five criteria: the socio economic profile of the area relating to the application; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant/s to implement the project; the level of integration-co-ordination; and the costings-value for money of the proposal.</P>
    <P>To enable the assessment of an application under these five criteria, information on a wide range of issues is gathered throughout the appraisal process. A number of factors are considered in assessing applications, including the profile of parents accessing the service; whether the provision of the particular service enables parents from disadvantaged circumstances return to education, training or employment; how the location of the applicant group is rated on the Haase Index of Relative Affluence and Deprivation; the fee structure implemented by the group and its implications for the disadvantaged in the community accessing the service; whether or not the facility facilitates children with special needs or those of ethnic diversity; and the mechanisms that the applicant has put in place to target-focus the service to attract disadvantaged families.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries as to the current position and I am informed that, as part of the assessment process, there have been ongoing discussions between ADM Limited and the groups in question regarding the extent to which the projects meet the above criteria. I understand that arising from these discussions the groups are considering the possibility of submitting revised applications and that a further meeting is being arranged in the next few days.</P>
    <P>Once the assessment and appraisal process is complete, I will make a decision shortly thereafter. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on these applications.</P>

      <P>Iwas disturbed to learn of the very unpleasant incidents outlined in the letter written by the person referred to by the Deputy. On the basis of the contents of this letter, I would strongly urge the writer to report these incidents <Col N="1419" /> to the Garda Síochána to determine whether or not a criminal act occured.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that an anti-racist component should be incorporated into the school curriculum, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and I will arrange to have the letter under reference forwarded for his attention.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that last October the Government agreed to my proposal to implement a national anti-racism public awareness programme, with the overall aim of contributing to creating the conditions for building a more inclusive and intercultural society, in which racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity valued. In February, I announced the composition of the high-level steering group to implement this programme, in partnership with the equality division of my Department, and work is proceeding apace.</P>
      <P>The Government has also introduced comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, such as the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, and agencies such as the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations have been set to investigate discrimination, including discrimination on racist grounds, in relation to employment and the provision of goods and services. Other bodies, such as the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the Garda Racial and Intercultural Office and the Reception and Integration Agency, have also been established.</P>
      <P>The NCCRI, in partnership with a range of non-government organisations, has organised a system of reporting racist incidents, and it encourages the victims of such incidents to do so. The purpose of this reporting system is to provide a profile of the number, type and location of incidents that are occurring and to identify emerging patterns.</P>

      <P>There are no provisions in Irish immigration law or procedure, or in EU law, whereby a non-EEA national may obtain permission to reside in the State on the basis of a relationship with an Irish national, except where the person in question is the spouse or an immediate dependent family member of the Irish national in question. However, it is open to any non-national to make an application to be allowed reside in the State and the nature and <Col N="1420" /> duration of that person's relationship with an Irish national, as well as the person's capacity to support himself or herself without recourse to public funds, would be taken into account in determining whether or not permission would be granted.</P>

      <P>Offenders, including life sentenced offenders, go through a process of preparation for release into the community and many remain under the supervision of my Department's probation and welfare service while serving the balance of their sentences on release. The service uses a variety of organisations in providing support and facilities for the long-term prisoner.</P>
      <P>Projects in the local community assist in the resettlement of offenders released from custody in providing training programmes and job opportunities. Ongoing efforts are made to provide more projects, subject to acceptance by the local community. These projects are financially assisted by my Department through the probation and welfare service.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Prison Service is planning to build half-way house type units at Cork and Limerick Prisons for both men and women. It is hoped that these will become operational early in 2002. In the longer term, a similar unit is also planned for Mountjoy Prison as part of the refurbishment of the Mountjoy complex. The Dóchas Centre &ndash; Mountjoy Women's Prison &ndash; already has a pre-release unit which accommodates up to seven prisoners who are generally nearing the end of medium to long-term sentences and are actively engaged in rehabilitative programmes, such as education and work training.</P>
      <P>The national development plan will also, through prison work programmes such as the CONNECT project, make a significant contribution towards preparing offenders for employment and, in addition, the linkage programme in the community will advance the position of employment placement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past four years, the Government has introduced comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation and other measures to combat racism and discrimination.</P>
      <P>It was a matter of regret that the significant progress already made by this Government was not acknowledged in the recent ill-judged publicity campaign by Amnesty International.</P>
      <P>Ireland has one of the most advanced anti-discrimination codes in Europe. Both the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, contain a broad definition of race which covers race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins. Indeed, Ireland was one of the leading EU partners in the preparation of the EU Race Directive which was adopted last June and in framing its directive, the European Commission modelled aspects of it on the Irish legislation.</P>
      <P>This Government enacted the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, which provided for the establishment of agencies such as the Equality Authority and an Office of the Director of Equality Investigations to provide redress for victims of racism and discrimination. Other bodies, such as the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the Garda Racial and Intercultural Office, and the Reception and Integration Agency, have also been established. The Government has funded several Traveller initiatives for a number of years, including the Citizen Traveller Campaign, and has also funded the NCCRI since 1998.</P>
      <P>In its campaign, Amnesty International calls for the review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989. As I stated at our National Conference Against Racism last autumn, many months before the Amnesty International campaign commenced, the 1989 Act is currently being reviewed in my Department with a view to improving its effectiveness. At this stage, I cannot predict a timescale for the completion of the review. However, I hope to conclude the review as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The NCCRI in partnership with a range of non-government organisations has organised a system of reporting racist incidents. Victims of racist incidents are encouraged to report such incidents. The purpose of the reporting system is to provide a profile of the number, type and location of incidents that are occurring and to identify emerging patterns. The NCCRI will issue reports on the information that is received.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has been to the forefront in devising strategies to deal with issues arising in policing a multicultural society, one measure of which is the establishment of the Garda Racial and Intercultural Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October the Government agreed to my proposal to implement a national anti-racism <Col N="1423" /> public awareness programme with the overall aim of contributing to creating the conditions for building a more inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland where racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued. In February I announced the composition of the high level steering group to implement the programme in partnership with the equality division of my Department. The steering group has begun its work.</P>
    <P>Its immediate task is to review existing research to ascertain the information already available on attitudes and opinions among the general public on racism and minority ethnic groups. The results of the review will determine what further information is needed as baseline research for the awareness programme. In May the steering group launched a grant scheme to assist community groups, including minority ethnic groups and non-government organisations working to combat racism. The group is currently making preparations for a formal launch of the awareness programme to take place in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The factual position is that this Government has been and continues to be active in dealing with the problem of racism and it would appear that Amnesty International failed to acquaint itself with the relevant facts before launching its publicity campaign.</P>

      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999, and the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Act, 2000, was commenced in full on 20 November 2000. Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted.</P>
      <P>These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>
      <P>A decision on the application in question will be made upon receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as appropriate.</P>

    <P>It is understood that the persons concerned made their application on 15 June 2000. The Deputy may wish to note that the persons in question have also applied for permission to remain on the basis of their parentage of an Irish <Col N="1424" /> born child. Applications of this nature are dealt with in chronological order and on this basis it is likely to be several months before their case is finalised.</P>

Typically, such evidence is in the form of a statement from a financial institution. Grants awarded under the programme are provisional until such time as the beneficiary complies with the conditions of the programme, which are outlined in the guidelines, <Col N="1461" /> terms and conditions of the sports capital programme and payments, which are made to the beneficiary's bank account, are made on foot of engineer or architects certificates of payment or invoices from contractors in respect of approved works.</P>

      <P>Each task force has a chairperson and a co-ordinator as well as members from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors and elected representatives. Together and individually they can play a significant part in winning support in the local communities for the strategies being pursued by the task forces, overcoming misapprehensions and fears around the provision of drug programmes and services in their areas. Representatives who are nominated to the task forces are expected to liaise with and encourage other elected representatives in their areas to support the work of the task forces.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte was the implementing body for tourism product development under the Tourism Operational Programme, 1994-99, with decisions on grant approval being made by an independent product management board. A similar arrangement will be in place, for the period of the current national development plan, under which I was able to obtain a commitment of £100 million &ndash; to be co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund &ndash; for tourism product development.</P>
      <P>The new tourism product investment scheme will be administered via the tourism measures of the Regional Operational Programmes. The overall objective of the scheme is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way which widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue. Funding for tourist accommodation developments is not a priority under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Detailed guidelines, for project promoters, on the new tourism product investment scheme have been drafted by Bord Fáilte, in consultation with my Department. Meanwhile the scheme is still being examined under the State aids rules by DG Competition of the European Commission, to whom the scheme has been formally notified as required by the relevant legislation.</P>

      <P>Dialogue Ireland has sought my views on the efficacy of current curriculum provision at primary and second levels to address issues such as young people coming under the influence of undesirable or extremist groups, cults, sects and new religious movements.</P>
      <P>The issues to which the group refers are addressed in a number of curriculum areas: in the social, personal and health education programme at primary level and in the civic, social and political education, social, personal and health education, and religious education syllabi at second level.</P>
      <P>Social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; is a new subject within the recently revised primary school curriculum. Among the aims of SPHE are: (1) to promote the personal development and well-being of the child; and (2) to enable the child to make informed decisions and choices about the social, personal and health dimensions of life, both now and in the future. Pupils are taught to be aware of and to respect the various cultural, religious, ethnic or other groups that exist in their communities. They are also taught self-protection, and safety skills, such as identifying and avoiding situations and people who make them feel threatened, and accepting an increasing degree of responsibility for their own safety and well-being as they get older. They are encouraged to be assertive, to know when to seek help and to confide in people whom they consider to be trustworthy. The SPHE curriculum is designed to be delivered in three ways: through the attitudes, values and practices conveyed through a positive school climate and atmosphere; through integration with other subject areas in a cross-curricular approach; and through dedicated time on the timetable. The content of the second level SPHE curriculum builds on the primary curriculum and develops these themes and skills at an appropriate level.</P>
      <P>Civic, social and political education &ndash; CSPE &ndash; prepares students for active participatory citizenship. The syllabus is based on a number of central concepts, which collectively inform and clarify the concept of citizenship. These include democracy, rights and responsibilities, human dignity and law. The syllabus helps students to develop their ability to explore, analyse and evaluate. It enables students to become skilled and practised in moral and critical appraisal and capable of making decisions and judgments, based on human rights and social responsibilities. In its methodology and assessment procedures, there is a significant bias towards the application of practical skills required for participatory citizenship. Thus, students are equipped to confront such issues as the work of groups, who might seek to impose their beliefs on others by illegal means or through the use of undue pressure or duress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> A religious education syllabus at junior certificate level is being introduced into second level schools on a phased basis and will be examined for the first time in 2003. This syllabus deals with the foundations of religious belief through a study of major world religions and among the stated aims of this subject are the following: to foster an awareness that the human search for meaning is common to peoples of all ages and at all times; to explore how this search for meaning has found and continues to find expression in religion; to appreciate the richness of religious traditions; and to acknowledge the non-religious interpretation of life.</P>
    <P>While the syllabus in religious education does not conflict in any way with established religions, it is not concerned primarily with faith formation or with catechetics. It will enable pupils to learn about a broad range of religious traditions and about the non-religious interpretation of life.</P>
    <P>A religious education syllabus for leaving certificate is under preparation at the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. This syllabus will provide for a more detailed study of world religions, including new religious movements. This aspect of the syllabus will focus on the definition of a cult, and on common characteristics and new religious movements. The treatment of this topic will take place in the context of the educational rationale for the inclusion of religious education in the curriculum as outlined in the syllabus.</P>

      <P>The pupil in question is currently receiving five hours per week resource teaching support and 18 hours per week special needs assistant support.</P>
      <P>My Department has not received an application for additional resource teaching support for the pupil in question. However, if the school authorities wish to submit an application for increased support for this child, the matter will certainly be considered.</P>
      <P>Applications for funding for the purchase of special equipment, including computer equipment, are considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the individual child or children involved. An application for computer equipment in respect of the pupil in question and a number of other special needs pupils attending the same school was considered by my Department's inspectorate in April 2000. A grant of £1,500 for computer equipment was allocated by my Department on that occasion in respect of two of the pupils involved in the application. It was considered that the needs of the remaining pupils, including the pupil referred to by the Deputy, did not warrant the allocation of funding for computer equipment at that time.</P>
      <P>However, I have asked my Department's inspectorate to review the needs of the child in question. As soon as the inspectorate's report is received, my Department will be in touch with the school authorities on the matter.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulty for secondary voluntary schools in recruiting part-time teachers - EPT - due to the restriction on hours worked, which does not apply in other areas of secondary education; and the rationale of the 11 hour restriction applied.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of certain difficulties being encountered by schools in the recruitment of teachers in specific subject areas. The level of difficulty varies by location, subject combinations and the tenure of the post available. While principals have reported difficulties in recruitment in certain areas, my Department is not aware of any second level school which has not filled its approved teacher allocation for the current year.</P>
      <P>The eligible part-time teachers &ndash; EPT &ndash; scheme, as agreed by representatives of teachers, school management and my Department, was introduced to enhance the conditions of part-time teachers at second level. The award of an EPT contract is subject to the condition that the hours in question can be accommodated within the approved teacher allocation for the individual voluntary secondary, community or comprehensive school or vocational education committee concerned.</P>
      <P>It is a requirement of the EPT scheme that, in order to qualify for the award of an eligible part-time teacher contract, a teacher in a second level school must be time-tabled for a minimum of 11 hours per week class contact for the school year. The maximum number of hours per week class contact for which an EPT can be time-tabled is 22.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 524 and 571 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Steering Group on the Funding of Second Level Schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post-primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
      <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
      <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the School Services Support Fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to per capita grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
      <P>In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard per capita grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
      <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>No provision has been made in the 2001 Estimates for the establishment of the national and local co-ordination structures recommended in the White Paper. However, other developments are already under way, such as the National Adult Literacy Strategy, improvements in the arrangements for self-funded part-time courses, a <Col N="1473" /> review of the administrative, technical and organisational structures for PLC courses, the development of an adult guidance service, and the implementation of an education equality initiative. The Back to Education Initiative is expected to come on stream in September/October. The National Qualifications Authority was established on a statutory footing at the end of February 2001, and the new awards councils for further and higher education have just been set up.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Adult Learning Council, resources for this will be examined in the context of the 2002 Estimates. The priority is to establish the national council to enable a range of development and advisory tasks to be carried out first, as a preparatory step before implementing the local structures.</P>

In parallel, the schools, with the support of the national school development planning service, have engaged in a process of needs identification and planning. In the light of the inspectors' findings and of the plans drawn up by the schools, I am providing a package of supports to help the schools to address the issues identified. The package includes the allocation of additional teaching staff and special needs assistants to both schools; the creation of a post of administrative principal at St Joseph's National Schools with the consequential appointment of a classroom teacher; augmentation of the current funding to the schools in respect of caretaking and secretarial services; the funding of a comprehensive in-career development programme in both schools; and refurbishment and other works at both schools.

      <Col N="1476" /> In addition, support will be provided to the two schools under the school development planning initiative until the end of 2001.

An officer of this service will be in contact with the principals of both schools to discuss the arrangements for this service.</P>

    <P>The intensive work being done by the management and teachers of St. Anne's and St. Joseph's schools in co-operation with parents' representatives, visiting teachers for Travellers, school development planning facilitators, psychologists and inspectors will build upon existing good practice and ensure that education of an excellent standard is provided for all the pupils. It is my intention to keep developments at these schools under review to ensure that this continues to be the case.</P>

      <P>A circular letter outlining my Department's policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils in primary schools issued to the boards of management of all schools recently. This policy was already outlined in Rule 64 of the Rules for National Schools and in a previous Department Circular 10/67. The circular (Primary Circular 11/01) reaffirms the policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils.</P>
      <P>In recent years my Department has allocated considerable support to schools for pupils with learning difficulties. Learning support teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants and a wide range of resources under the various schemes for schools in areas designated as disadvantaged are among the forms of additional support allocated to schools for these pupils. The level of provision now available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school, in keeping with their peers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there may be individual cases where a principal teacher, following consultation with the learning support teacher and class teacher and parents of the pupil, concludes that a pupil would benefit educationally by being allowed to repeat a school year. In such cases my Department would allow the retention provided there is an educational basis for it, and there is a clear programme for the pupil to follow.</P>
      <P>Children should repeat a year for particular educational reasons only and an additional grade level should not be created through the retention in a grade level of all or a substantial number of pupils for a second year.</P>

      <P>At primary level, 350 new teaching posts are being allocated for the 2001-02 school year. These posts were agreed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In addition, a further 45 posts which arose from the retention of the demographic dividend are also allocated for the 2001-02 school year. The allocation of these posts, some of which facilitated improvements in the staffing schedule for the 2001-02 school year will help to further reduce class sizes in primary schools.</P>

      <P>A provision of £2.460 million has been made available to my Department in the financial year 2001 to support child care for participants on VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller training programmes operated by the Vocational Education Committees (VECs). The funds can be used for: direct provision of crèche facilities, including staffing, overheads and refurbishment, where appropriate; purchase of places in existing crèches, subject to a maximum of £50 per week per child for full sessions; and payment to childminders to a maximum of £50 per week per child, subject to appropriate invoicing arrangements, compliance with registration requirements under the Childcare Act and satisfactory implementation of tax clearance arrangements.</P>
      <P>Figures available for the academic year 2000-01 show that 1,050 students on VTOS, Youthreach and Traveller programmes are benefiting from the measure, catering for 1,308 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, £344 million, comprising EU and Exchequer funding, has been allocated to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. It is open to all schools to apply for this funding. Under the programme, capital grants are available to both community based/not-for-profit groups and self-employed/private providers of child care facili<Col N="1479" /> ties. Staffing grants are also available for community based/not-for-profit groups who have a particular focus on disadvantage.

      <P>The additional funding provided in 2001 for the implementation of measures in the White Paper reflects an increase of £23.7 million over the 2000 outturn. This includes continuing increases in adult literacy funds as part of a national adult literacy strategy, allied with improved funding in community education services, from £12.092 million to £15.416 million; phase 2 of the development of an adult educational guidance service; increases to provide for the establishment of the National Qualifications Authority, and the further and higher education and training awards councils; improvements in the structures in schools for self funded adult education programmes in second level schools and colleges; a review of the organisational, administrative and management structures for PLC courses; implementation of the Back to Edu<Col N="1480" /> cation initiative, providing for a major expansion of part-time options across Youthreach, VTOS, Traveller and PLC programmes in the further education sector; and development of a management information system for further education.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides funding for a range of measures set out in the White Paper over the period 2000-06, including over £1 billion in the period 2000-06 for the Back to Education initiative, £35 million for further education support and an adult guidance service, £3.68 million for computerisation and development of a management system, £73.8 million for adult literacy, and £3.5 million for the educational disadvantage measure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers may retire voluntarily on reaching age 55, provided they have 35 years service, or at any time after reaching age 60.

      <P>The National Council for Vocational Awards provides certification at level 2 for the <Col N="1486" /> majority of courses in my Department's post leaving certificate programme. The NCVA established the higher education links scheme in 1995 to facilitate progression from NCVA level 2 certificates to higher education. This scheme operates in conjunction with the National Council for Educational Awards, the institutes of technology and the Central Applications Office.</P>
      <P>Under the higher education links scheme, places on selected courses in the institutes of technology are allocated on the basis of attainment achieved in the NCVA level 2 awards by candidates on linked PLC courses. Details are available on the web at www.ncva.ie and are circulated annually to school principals and guidance counsellors. Candidates submit their third level applications to the CAO in the normal way. The scheme is organised on a national rather than constituency basis and approximately 2000 third level places are available in 2001 on 250 courses. Each NCVA level 2 module covered by the scheme is credited, with three points allocated for a distinction, two points for a merit and one point for a pass. Places are offered in ranked order until the quota is complete for each course.</P>
      <P>PLC courses are delivered by a network of over 230 schools and colleges throughout the country in the vocational, secondary and community and comprehensive school sector, but the bulk of provision is in vocational colleges. In all, there are over 1,400 courses to choose from in over 60 disciplines. All second level schools are invited each year to apply for inclusion in the PLC programme. Overall, a survey of the destinations of PLC leavers shows that 21.6% of participants progress to third level education, while a further 8.56% go to some other form of vocational education or training. 64.5% enter employment.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency has so far assigned one psychologist to County Clare. This psychologist currently provides a service to 26 primary schools in the county. Most of these are located in the areas around Ennis and Shannon. Almost 100 primary schools in the county do not yet have access to the NEPS service.</P>
      <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of the school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>The pace of recruitment of psychologists to work in the mid-western region has been slower than that in some other areas. NEPS has therefore identified the region as a high priority for assigning psychologists from the next competition, which will take place later this year. It is envisaged that there will ultimately be five NEPS psychologists in County Clare.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that children who attend schools not yet served by NEPS should not have to wait until the psychological service is fully developed before having access to psychological assessments. I have therefore made £1.25 million available to NEPS for a scheme to fund assessments carried out by private practitioners. NEPS will be writing to all schools before the end of the month with details of how to apply for the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched, initially in 58 schools. This marked a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. In May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
      <P>It is expected that further invitations will issue to schools to participate in the future. The selection of schools for invitation to participate has been based on overall enrolment figures and the number of pupils failing to remain in school up to the completion of the senior cycle. For some time my Department has been involved in detailed analysis of data from individual schools which has allowed a more complete picture of early school leaving to be developed than has been the case in the past. This has allowed resources under the stay in school Initiative to be targeted at schools through which they should reach the greatest possible number of young people at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> The current method used to select schools for invitation into the Initiative will be reviewed prior to issuing invitations to any further schools to participate in the initiative. The selection process will continue to target resources to where they benefit locations with the highest concentrations of young people at risk.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, 200 teaching posts will be allocated to second level schools in the 2001-02 school year. No decision has been taken on the actual allocation of the additional posts.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced that 50 additional guidance posts are to be allocated to schools for use by them in developing innovative ways of enhancing their guidance provision, especially in promoting links between schools and business. Schools will shortly be invited to propose innovative actions they would undertake in order to enhance their guidance provision. Posts will be allocated on the basis of an objective assessment of these proposals.</P>
    <P>An expert group is currently reviewing the current procedures for the allocation of teachers at second level. I expect to receive the report of the expert group shortly.</P>

However, I am informed that these difficulties are close to resolution and that it is proposed that the two special classes will become fully operational in September 2001.</P>
    <P>Each of the classes in question will cater for a maximum of six pupils with autism. Two permanent teaching posts and four permanent special needs assistant posts have already been sanctioned by my Department for these classes.</P>
    <P>The provision of therapeutic support services for the classes in question is a matter for the relevant health authority. I have asked my officials to contact the relevant health authority to ensure that the necessary support services are made available.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that some schools are experiencing trying to obtain insurance cover for the school premises; if his attention has further been drawn to the financial burden placed on schools due to insurance conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have not been made aware that some schools are experiencing difficulties in obtaining insurance cover for their premises.</P>
      <P>At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools, including insurance costs. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since this Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £75.50 per pupil in this school year. In addition, a rate of £80 per pupil will apply in the 2001-02 school year. This constitutes an increase of some 77% over that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, the funding arrangements for our schools, including insurance, have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner that reflects the traditional sectoral division of our second level system. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid to voluntary secondary school funding costs is provided by my Department by way of per capita grants, which <Col N="1492" /> may be used for this purpose. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, the relevant vocational education committee arranges insurance cover. With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements, including insurance, for the different school types at second level. I am committed to bringing greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the reported incidence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the difficulties which this condition can present for parents and teachers of such children. I can assure the Deputy that I am most anxious to ensure that all necessary support services are made available to the children in question.</P>
      <P>Some such children can be capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. In October 1998 the Government decided that all children with special needs in primary schools, including children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As a result of this decision the number of resource teachers supporting special needs children in primary schools has been increased from 104 to more than 950. The number of special needs assistants supporting such children has been increased from less than 300 to more than 2000 over the same period. My Department is continuing to allocate these resources in response to identified needs.</P>
      <P>Where the level of the disorder is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue to build on these developments so as to ensure that all children, including children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, receive the support they require.</P>

      <P>Phase I of the extension project for Scoil Uí Mhuiri was completed in the mid 1990s in such a way as to facilitate the later addition of a second phase, if this became necessary as a result of demographic changes. County Louth Vocational Education Committee applied to my Department for funding towards the purchase of a site for phase II of the extension to the school in November 1995. The site purchase was completed by the VEC in 1999. My Department funded the VEC to make this purchase. The architectural planning process for phase II of the extension commenced prior to the completion of the site purchase, but only limited progress could be made with this as long as there continued to be uncertainty as to availability of the site.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a stage 3 (developed sketch scheme) has now been submitted to my Department and is being examined at present. The next stage of the architectural planning process will include obtaining planning permission for the phase II extension. Assuming that planning permission is obtained I do not anticipate any significant delay in completing the architectural planning process. At this early stage it is not possible to estimate the cost of the project. It is too early to predict when it will be possible to seek tenders for the construction of the extension, but every effort will be made to do this as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>At present my Department is liaising with the VEC regarding the provision of temporary accommodation for use by the school until the new permanent accommodation can be provided.</P>

This policy was already outlined in rule 64 of the Rules for National Schools and in a previous Department Circular 10/67. The Circular (Primary Circular 11/01) reaffirms the policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils.</P>
      <P>In recent years, my Department has allocated considerable support to schools for pupils with learning difficulties. Learning support teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants and a wide range of resources under the various schemes for schools in areas designated as disadvantaged are among the forms of additional support allocated to schools for these pupils. The level of provision now available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school, in keeping with their peers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there may be individual cases where a principal teacher, following consultation with the learning support teacher and class teacher and parents of the pupil, concludes that a pupil would benefit educationally by being allowed repeat a school year. In such cases, as outlined in the Circular Letter 11/01, my Department would allow the retention provided there is an educational basis for it, and there is a clear programme for the pupil to follow.</P>

      <P>In October 1998 the Government decided that all children with special needs in primary schools, including children in the categories to which the Deputy refers, should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs irrespective of their level of need or location.</P>
      <P>Early in 1999 my Department issued a circular to all primary schools informing them of the above development. The circular advised schools of the levels of support available in respect of children in each disability category and the procedures to be followed by schools wishing to access such support.</P>
      <P>Arising from this development, the number of resource teachers allocated to primary schools to support special needs children in integrated settings has grown from 104 to more than 950. The number of special needs assistants deployed across the primary system has grown from less than 300 to more than 2000 over the same period. These developments have provided a significant body of data on the nature and level of special needs in primary schools. Further resource teacher and special needs assistant support is being deployed on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs.</P>
      <P>My Department has also commenced work on the development of the primary pupil data base. One of the objectives of this work will be to facilitate a more effective system of identification of children with special needs, including children in the categories to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <Quest>the minimum number of students in primary schools for which the services of a full-time caretaker will be provided.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and PRSI. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional per-capita grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per capita grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme by its nature is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>Since the commencement of the school year 1999-2000, the remedial teacher service has been available to all first and second level schools. A total of 1,480 remedial teachers are now in place in first level schools and a further 560 whole-time remedial teacher equivalents are in place at second level.</P>
      <P>Many children with special needs are capable of attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teachers and/or special needs assistants. Since October 1998 the number of resource teachers supporting such children in primary schools has been increased from 104 to more than 950. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from less than 300 to more than 2,000 over the same period.</P>
      <P>Children with more serious special needs can be catered for in special schools dedicated to particular disability groups or in special classes attached to mainstream schools. The special schools can cater for children in the age range four to 18 years. All special schools and special classes operate at reduced pupil teacher ratios and pupils attending such facilities attract special increased rates of capitation funding. There are more than 100 special schools and more than 400 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools.</P>
      <P>At second level, pupils with special needs are generally catered for in integrated settings. Such pupils are currently supported by a total 240 resource teacher posts and 135 special needs assistant posts. In addition, the equivalent of approximately 142 whole-time teacher equivalents in concessionary teaching hours have been allocated to ordinary second level schools to cater for pupils with special needs.</P>

      <P>The revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training is currently funded by the Department of Health and Children. I understand there are some 1,500 training places currently available on the programme. The Commission on Nursing has recommended that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses should be based on a four year degree programme which will encompass clinical placements, including 12 months continuous clinical placement as a paid <Col N="1508" /> employee of the health service. The commission envisaged that the start of the 2002-03 academic year would be specified as the commencement date of the proposed new degree programme.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the Commission on Nursing, the Nursing Education Forum was established by the Minister for Health and Children to agree a strategy for the implementation of degree level pre-registration nursing education and training. The forum reported in October 2000 and the Government has agreed in principle to the introduction of the proposed four year pre-registration nursing degree programme in 2002-03 subject to the satisfactory resolution of certain outstanding issues. These relate to the additional capital and revenue funding required to support the programme and the basis on which nurse teachers will transfer to the higher education sector. As recommended by the forum, the Minister for Health and Children has established an interdepartmental steering group to deal with the funding and policy issues associated with the proposed transition and the integration of the nursing students into higher education. Both my Department and the Higher Education Authority are participating in the work of the group.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to medical education is that the current intake to undergraduate medical courses is the subject of a quota, which was introduced in 1980-81 following a report of the Higher Education Authority. The question of reviewing the current quota arrangements is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health and Children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff recruitment and retention of staff is a challenge facing all employers in the public and private sectors in the current economic situation. I am aware of reports that in the case of some schools it is more difficult than heretofore to fill available posts in the education sector.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. A range of measures has been introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the difficulty.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A post-graduate course commenced early in 2001 with an intake of 280 students. The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years. Discussions are taking place with the colleges of education to commence a further post-graduate course in early 2002.</P>
      <P>The projected requirements for primary teachers are considered by my Department on an ongoing basis taking account of changes in the demand and supply for teachers. Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the survey undertaken recently by the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, which indicated that some second level schools had experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. However, my Department is not aware of any second level school that has not filled its approved teacher allocation for the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teacher supply and demand issue at second level is very complex. Analyses undertaken by my Department in 1997 indicated that there are <Col N="1510" /> regional and subject variations. Schools in certain locations have more difficulties in recruitment while specific subjects may pose particular difficulties. A further complicating factor is that vacancies in second level schools usually require specific subject combinations.</P>
    <P>The number of places on the Higher Diploma in Education course has increased by 25% since 1997-98. My Department is continuing to review the supply and demand of second level teachers on an ongoing basis. Over the past number of years a range of measures has been implemented which has a positive impact on the supply and retention of teachers. These include increased number and proportion of permanent teaching posts; retention of supernumerary posts in the teaching service; improvement of access to teacher pension schemes; new management structure for schools with a significant increase in promotion posts for teachers; increased allowances for posts of responsibility; new management structure for schools which deliver adult education programmes; employee assistance service for teachers in certain areas; new career break and job sharing arrangements; in-career development for teachers; third level course fee refund scheme; qualifications allowances for all recognised teachers; recognition of qualifications for permanent appointment in vocational preparation and training courses; easing of Irish requirement for the generality of teachers; and extension and improvement of incremental credit arrangements including full credit for reckonable teaching service given in the EU.</P>
    <P>In relation to the third level sector, I understand that the Higher Education Authority has not been formally advised by any university of serious difficulties in staff recruitment or retention. However, the authority has advised that in common with other sectors of the economy it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit and retain clerical staff and personnel for posts in IT areas. I understand also that institutes of technology are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting and retaining clerical staff and staff for certain posts in areas such as information technology, electrical and electronic engineering. My Department is keeping the situation under review in conjunction with the management authorities of the institutes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 614 and 615 together.</P>
      <P>There were some 116,000 students in third level institutions aided by my Department in 1999-2000, the last year for which statistics are available and my Department is projecting an increase on this figure to some 119,000 in the current year. Within the figure of 116,000 there were some 46,000 students in the institute of technology sector.</P>
      <P>The first review of the 1995 Report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education was carried out by a study group under the chairmanship of Dr. Donal de Buitléir which reported in March 1999. The review group concluded that the appropriate strategic objective for Ireland should be to first achieve and then maintain a position well within the top quarter of OECD countries in terms of the participation of the population in post second level education and training, and in the quality of that education and training. The review group noted that existing and planned investment in third level places would result in capacity of 114,000 full-time places by 2001 and it considered that this increased capacity would allow Ireland to meet its strategic objective in relation to undergraduate provision for traditional school leavers. The review group also noted that provision should be kept under review in the light of factors such as unanticipated skills demand, postgraduate needs and developments in competitor countries. In recommending that an additional stock of up to 10,000 places for mature students be built up over a number of years, the review group considered that the demand should first be validated by appropriate market research on the target population.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority was requested to benchmark our performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the top quarter of OECD countries, to monitor developments in other countries and to recommend any necessary adjustments to the level of third level provision. The authority is finalising its first benchmarking exercise which will be available shortly. On the question of provision for mature students, the authority has commissioned market research on the demand for mature student provision, as recommended by the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has taken a number of initiatives to ensure a sufficient supply of skilled personnel in emerging labour market needs areas. The First Report of the Expert Group on Future <Col N="1512" /> Skills Needs was published in December 1998 and addressed the need of the information technology sector. In response to the needs identified in the report, £75 million was allocated for the provision of 5,400 IT related third level places, £6 million was provided to facilitate the continuation of 1,500 places on postgraduate conversion courses in IT related areas and the accelerated technician programmes were expanded to include IT.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of the second report, published in March 2000, included the provision of an extra 1,150 degree level places to be introduced on a phased basis in the chemical and biological sciences, an increase in the numbers on accelerated technician programmes and increased provision of off-the-job component of apprenticeship programmes. In response to these recommendations, the first wave of additional intake to degree programmes in the chemical and biological sciences commenced in the 2000-01 academic year. My Department in conjunction with the institutes of technology, has increased educational provision in a number of identified skills needs areas. Since the beginning of 1998, 2,411 places have been created under the ATP programme in various skills areas. The provision of apprenticeship training places in the education sector has also been increased from 4,000 places in the 1997-98 academic year to 8,896 training places in the current academic year. Some 700 extra places were provided in a special summer course in June 2000. It is expected that over 1,100 additional training places will be provided in the academic year 2001-02. Plans are also being finalised with regard to conducting a summer course again this year which will provide training for a further 1,000 apprentices.</P>
    <P>In 1998, my Department introduced an 11 week summer computing course in a number of institutes of technology. These courses have to date provided training for over 800 participants.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the institutes of technology, launched a new technician programme in May 2001. The proposed Institute trainee programme will aim to further develop national skill programmes in areas of identified and emerging key skill shortages. The programme will involve close partnership with industry/employers and my Department will provide funding for up to 1,000 institute trainees in 2001.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides for £550 million funding for research activity in the third level sector over the period 2000-06 to support the development of a world class research environment in higher education in Ireland. Funding is targeted at a range of sub-measures including support for postgraduate and post-doctoral researchers.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate from the range of measures and initiatives I have outlined, the <Col N="1513" /> needs of the third level sector are constantly kept under review.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for a national educational psychological service recommended in September 1998 that the Minister for Education and Science should establish a national educational psychological service agency, as an executive agency of the Department. The report also recommended that the agency would have an overall target number of 200 psychologists. This will allow for an educational psychological service to be provided to all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>However, I recognise that there is a current need for some schools and parents to be able to gain access to psychological assessments pending the full development of the NEPS service. I recently announced the allocation of £1.25 million to NEPS for the purchase of assessments from private practitioners. The management of NEPS has developed an action plan for the implementation of this scheme. Guidelines on how to avail of the scheme will be issued to schools before the end of this month.</P>

    <P>Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs in primary schools, including children in County Kildare, now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The response in question may take the form of resource teacher support or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the particular needs involved. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting children with special needs in primary schools has been increased from 104 to more than 950. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from less than 300 to more than 2,000 over the same period. My Department is continuing to allocate such resources on an ongoing basis in response to assessed need and will respond to any such needs arising in County Kildare.</P>
