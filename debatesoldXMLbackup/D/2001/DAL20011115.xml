      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with three different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I call on Deputy McGinley to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I give notice of my intention to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to consider an urgent and important matter of public concern, namely, the proposal by the Minister for Health and Children to increase the cost of a private bed by 15%, thereby pushing up voluntary health insurance premia for the third time this year, this time by as much as 4%, bringing the increase by one company to almost 20%, and to seek an urgent statement from the Minister on this important issue.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be No. 23a, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Financial Resolution; No. 24, motion re Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (Eligible Customer) Order, 2001, returned from committee; No. 50, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 51, Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) and No. 51a, Statements on Afghanistan, to be taken not later than 2 p.m. and the Order shall not resume thereafter. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 23a and 24, shall be decided without debate and the Report and Final Stages of No. 50 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 12 noon by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources; the proceedings on No. 51a, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes; and Members may share time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. The first is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 23a and 24 without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not agreed to. I oppose this because the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (Eligible Customer) Order, 2001, is to be taken. Before that is done we should hear from the Ministers for Public Enterprise and the Environment and Local Government about their cloak <Col N="263" /> and dagger move to exempt mobile telephone masts from planning regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 23a and 24 without debate, agreed to? Agreed. The second proposal is the proposal for dealing with No. 50, Report and Final Stages of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>]. Is it agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 51a, statements on Afghanistan, agreed to? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to wish every success to the Irish soccer team in Tehran this afternoon. They have been unlucky on a number of previous occasions and I hope they are successful this time. While speaking about sporting matters, will the Taoiseach comment on the assertion by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation that the Sports Campus Ireland project will go ahead as planned despite the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, cannot provide money for 365 primary schools any more, that there are no sports halls in 65% of primary schools and 50% of secondary schools and that the Minister for Finance announced last Sunday that projects in the national development plan would not go ahead? Is Sports Campus Ireland going ahead as planned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach illuminate the position of the Government following the replies given yesterday by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, and in particular his reply of 4 October, which said the report of the so-called independent consultants on the viability and acceptability of the project would be published before any decision is made? A decision has been made in advance of the publication of the report. Can he ensure the report will be published in conjunction with the Estimates later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Noonan in wishing our national team well. It is a pity we do not have a stadium that would hold half the number of supporters the stadium in Tehran holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have had a stadium if the Government had not withdrawn the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the capacity will have been reduced to 22,000, 100,000 less than the number of people supporting our opposition later, before anything is built. I still wish the team well. I have nothing to add to what the Minister <Col N="264" /> for Tourism, Sport and Recreation said yesterday during Question Time. As the House will be aware, Stadium Campus Ireland must go through the planning process and so on and it will probably be 2004 before any significant expenditure is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime the Minister for Education and Science has spent four times that which the previous Government spent on schools while the Minister for Health and Children has doubled expenditure and, I hope that will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>How much money will the Government have to spend next year? The Taoiseach should ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, because he wants everyone to leave the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, while we are not bound to significant investment for a number of years, in general in regard to sport we have moved from a position where we spent less than £13 million annually to acceptable levels of funding for sport and community organisations. We still have a good deal to do in this area and I hope that continues throughout this decade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the phasing of the project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the project is finally approved by the Government, the expert report will have to be taken into account. They are seeking an analysis of a number of things that we should wisely do. The Government will have to do those things. The phasing of the project is based on whether there is a campus and other facilities. There is plenty of room for manoeuvre in phasing it. It is sad that it will take some years to provide these facilities. It is an awful pity that we do not have them. Even in an enlarged EU Ireland will still be the country at the end of the decade with probably the worst sporting facilities, which is an indictment of all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The report states:</P>
      <P>Adults go hungry to feed their children out of a welfare allowance of £15 a week. Different dietary needs of people of different nationalities are largely ignored in hostels. Hostels are chronically overcrowded with entire families living in one room. Teenage boys and girls have no privacy and usually have to share rooms with their parents. Children lose respect for parents who are allowed little influence over their own or their children's day to day lives and needless repression and intimidation by staff is a feature of some life in our hostels.</P>
      <P>This is the direct result of a Government policy which the Taoiseach admired when he was in Australia. Will the Government continue with this shameful system of treating human beings? If not, what course of action will be taken in its stead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="266" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the rights provided to all citizens under the Constitution also apply to everybody who is resident in Ireland, including asylum seekers? What steps will he take to vindicate these rights on behalf of this much set upon minority in our community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we should be very mindful of people's constitutional rights and human rights, if they are not citizens. This country arguably has the most liberal immigration and asylum regime. I heard about the report overnight and I asked the relevant sections for their views this morning. They refute claims made by the Irish Refugee Council in the latest document, &ldquo;Beyond the Pale&rdquo;, regarding asylum seeking children and social exclusion in the State. I am informed that the sample that forms the basis for the report is 43 families in Limerick, Cork and Ennis, of which 30% were living under direct provision. Therefore, it was a very small sample.</P>
      <P>However, accommodation providers and other companies engaged by the State are required to ensure that all accommodation centres comply with and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and other agencies in regard to planning, building by-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general safety. All the planning requirements and statutory regulations are observed and in circumstances where asylum seeking parents and children are accommodated in centres operated by the agency, RIA, particular emphasis is placed on meeting their needs.</P>
      <P>When I contacted the relevant section earlier I was told the costs are provided in each reception and accommodation centre where infants are accommodated and toilet and bathroom facilities are provided in accordance with whatever are the relevant statutory requirements. The memorandum agreement stipulates that as a minimum cots, which were mentioned in the report, infant formula, infant food, access to fresh water for the preparation of infant formula, sterilisers sufficient for a number of infant children, water boiling facilities, refrigerators, microwaves and bottle warmers must be provided.</P>
      <P>The inspectorate unit within the RIA conducts regular detailed inspections of each location where asylum seekers are accommodated. Any diminution in standards which comes to light as a result of such inspections is treated very seriously and can lead to termination of contracts where that is deemed to be warranted. There are also safety nets in place where for medical or social reasons asylum seekers have been taken out of direct provision by community welfare officers. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs pays benefits when that happens.</P>
      <P>One can always take samples and come up with figures but the State spends in excess of £150 million on these provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is trying to improve and acquire better accommodation all the time. There are difficulties sometimes. Many Members know what happens. People in their constituencies take legal action to prevent accommodation centres being established and many cases are before the courts currently. However, that view is not taken in other constituencies. That is a difficulty but accommodation is available and significant moneys are being invested in this area and in controls. The view of the people who are doing their best in this area is that the report is entirely unfair and unjustifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very fair report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it the Taoiseach's view is that the independent report compiled by three academics, Dr. Brian Fanning, Dr. Angela Veale and Ms Dawn O'Connor, has been rejected by Government sources and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as being biased and unscientific? Does he feel ashamed that a respected, independent journalist could begin a report in the following way: &ldquo;If a parent did to any other child what the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does to the children of asylum seekers, the social workers would be called in&ldquo;?</P>
      <P>All if not most of the problems identified in this report could be solved if asylum seekers were allowed to work in this country. This is the view of the Catholic bishops, it is the view of my own party, it is the view of the Taoiseach's partners in Government and I suspect it is the view of many of the Taoiseach's backbenchers. It is vigorously opposed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by the particular Minister who heads up that Department. Surely the Taoiseach with his wide itinerary which enables him to visit anywhere in the country could visit some of these asylum seekers and verify for himself whether his version or this version of the truth is the correct one? Will the Taoiseach at last recognise that the fundamental human right of any person is the right to work? Many of the problems identified would be resolved if asylum seekers were given the right to work and the consequent dignity that comes with that. They would then have the independent resources to feed their own children &ndash; children who are identified as being malnourished under the provision of the State in the year 2001.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could recite a litany of statistics of the numbers of staff who are working&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach could answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will. I could give details of the numbers of staff who have been assigned under the Refugee Act to process the applications for asylum in order to bring the work down to manageable proportions. I believe that by the end of this year they will be down to a six month period and they have been struggling to achieve that over the last few years. There are now over 610 staff if I recall correctly compared to the 20 who were there four years ago. When asylum seekers have gone through the internationally recognised process they can then be treated. We have the most liberal immigration policy in the entire world and that is something to be proud of. No other country allows that a child born in the country to somebody who arrived that day is regarded as a citizen. Nowhere else has even thought of that.</P>
      <P>I have visited the hotels in my constituency that have been purchased by the State to accommodate asylum seekers. I believe there is more accommodation provided in my constituency than elsewhere because my constituency does not take the attitude of people in other constituencies who run to seek a judicial review and legal action in order to stop them because they think there is something wrong with them. Sin ceist eile.</P>
      <P>If there are problems and difficulties then, as Deputy Noonan said, we should ensure their constitutional and legal rights. We are spending £150 million and we will spend more next year. We will continue to provide resources for asylum seekers. We should be proud of the liberal attitude taken by this country rather&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, and that is why we gave it much more time. Over twice the average time, even for a complex Second Stage debate, has been given to the Bill. It is correct that this time was given to it and we promised that would be done, but it will conclude next Tuesday night. In relation to how Committee Stage is dealt with, as Members are aware, this issue has been around for the past four and a half years in one form or another. I stated that I wanted the Bill concluded by Christmas and I will speak to the Whip about how it will be taken. However, I want the Bill completed in the Oireachtas by Christmas.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been the subject of a special Dáil committee and plenary hearings with interested parties. The Bill contains a unique provision whereby the primary legislation will be locked into the Constitution. Once it is enacted, and if it is ratified by the citizens of the Republic, it can never come back to the House. For those reasons, this is not ordinary legislation. It is appropriate in legal and legislative terms that this matter, which is unique in terms of the way it proposes to provide for legislation as distinct from amending the Constitution, is taken in the Chamber. This would enable every Deputy to participate in the debate and also ensure that the media give it the correct level of attention which, due to a lack of resources, it cannot give to the committees.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is reneging on a fundamental commitment given to all Deputies and parties in the House that there would be an opportunity to tease out and debate the detail of the legislation, as distinct from the proposed amendment of the Constitution, on Committee Stage. I ask the Taoiseach to rethink his reply. My party will sit late if necessary to facilitate the rest of the Government's legislative programme. If time is a factor, we should order extra time to facilitate the type of debate in the Chamber that is required because the matter will never come back to the House.</P>

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to consider that point. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Constitution. The House rarely deals with such Bills and if the legislation is sent to a select committee, all Members will not have an opportunity to attend the proceedings, table amendments and debate the Bill in the same way as they would if Committee Stage was taken in the Chamber. In addition, the media do not have <Col N="274" /> the ability to cover all the committees of the House. I ask the Taoiseach to comply with the undertaking that was given and to ensure that the Committee Stage is taken in the Chamber.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Deputies' points, but they heard what I said. I want the Bill through before Christmas. Some 35 amendments have been tabled already by the Fine Gael Party and they will take a considerable amount of time to process. The possibility of referring the Bill to a committee is being considered to ensure sufficient time is available for it. Our view is that approximately eight full days could be provided for the Bill if it was dealt with by a committee. I do not see how the same amount of time could be worked into the House's schedule.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, line 6, after &ldquo;1997,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;TO CONFIRM FEES PAYABLE TO THE MINISTER FOR THE MARINE AND NATU<Col N="277" /> RAL RESOURCES IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN FISH CULTURE AND AQUACULTURE LICENCES&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are intended to safeguard licence fees imposed administratively. I record my appreciation to the Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine which dealt with the Bill and the major amendments thereto on 24 October. The House is now completing its consideration of the Bill. Amendment No. 1 extends the long title of the Bill which conveniently describes the Bill's scope. This amendment is necessary to accommodate the addition of a substantive new section 14 to the Bill through amendment No. 2 to safeguard certain licence fees.</P>
    <P>The office of the Attorney General has advised that express statutory provision, as proposed, is the only way to remove doubt about the validity of licence fees imposed administratively, that is, otherwise than by way of regulations provided for in section 15 of the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1959 for fish culture licences or section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980 for aquaculture licences. Both sections 15 and 54 have been repealed by sections 5 and 4, respectively, of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. In accordance with the licence fee rates determined administratively in 1987, more than £1.5 million in fees has been collected in respect of the licences concerned with a further £600,000 due for payment during the remainder of the currency of the licences concerned.</P>
    <P>Licence fees at the rates determined administratively in 1987 were agreed to by the licensees and, therefore, where the licences in question have some time to run before they expire, those rates will apply for the remainder of the licence period. The proposed statutory provision copperfastens that fees position. There is no doubt about the validity of any of the fees imposed under the Foreshore Acts in respect of foreshore licences granted for aquaculture purposes on State-owned foreshore. Those Acts do not require making regulations to impose licence fees.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 made comprehensive new provision for aquaculture licensing and replaced all previous aquaculture licensing legislation. It also expressly provided for the imposition of licence fees by ministerial regulation and such regulations were made in 1998. Those regulations provided for increased rates of licence fees in respect of the licences granted under that Act or earlier licences renewed under that Act. The regulations also provided for a new fee to be charged for applications to renew licences granted, in addition to a new fee to be charged for applications for licences or reviews of licences to take account of increased administrative costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what this proposal involves. My understanding is that fees for aquaculture licences were determined adminis<Col N="278" /> tratively and had nothing to do with ministerial orders. Obviously, the Minister's legal people felt the constitutionality of this approach could be questioned and tested in the court. This was clearly not identified prior to the introduction of the wide-ranging 1997 Act. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that this Bill will not result in current licence holders paying less or more in licence fees or not paying any licence fees at all.</P>

      <P>Before we conclude, I would like to raise a further matter. The Bill started as a relatively small Bill, but it has been added to as needs have arisen. There is nothing wrong with that, but I would like the Minister to state that one of the primary elements of the Bill is that it is retrospective. I would like the Minister to say, as the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, has done on a number of occasions during this Bill's passage through the House, that unsuccessful applicants will be told the reasons their applications for licences were rejected.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Claimants to the redress board will be people who allege abuse while they were resident in an institution in respect of which State bodies had regulatory or supervisory functions. The institutions concerned are mainly reformatory and industrial schools and orphanages. The compensation scheme will remain open to receive claims for a period of three years from the establishment date, to give sufficient time to ensure that as many potential claimants as possible are made aware of the scheme before it closes. The redress board, which will be the compensation awarding body, will be chaired by a senior retired or serving member of the legal profession or a judge. It will have enough ordinary members as will ensure the efficient discharge of its functions.</P>
      <P>The role of the board is specified in Section 4 of the Bill. It will make awards, in accordance with the Act, that are fair and reasonable, having regard to the unique circumstances of each applicant. All reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that former residents of institutions shall be aware of its capacity to make awards. The board will deal first with applicants who are elderly or in poor health and will have a general duty to ensure that its hearings are conducted as informally as possible. Validation of claims is to be conducted in a non-adversarial way, with inquiries to be confined to establishing essential facts from written records and further inquiry to be confined to oral examination of the claimant, combined with medical or psychiatric assessment.</P>
      <P>Compensation will be paid for current and continuing damage caused by abuse and past damage, from which the claimant has now recovered, where objectively it can be established that such damage exists or existed. Detailed criteria for awards, including a schedule of awards for different kinds of abuse and its effects, will be set down by ministerial regulation and laid before the Houses. This approach ensures objectivity in determining the amount of compensation and greater consistency of awards. It will also provide greater transparency in the award making system and allow claimants a better opportunity to know in advance the likely scale of an award. On 30 August, I appointed a committee of experts to advise on compensation amounts for abuse in childhood. I expect the committee to report to me next month and I will arrange for the publication of the report as soon as practicable thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the proposal that the Bill should not be allowed to proceed pending the publication of the committee's report. My objective has always been to ensure that the Bill is published and enacted <Col N="281" /> in the shortest time possible, in order to allow adequate time for consultation. Uncertainty can cause considerable stress for victims of abuse, whose lives have already been marked by serious grief. The age of many potential claimants means that the passage of time will rob some people of the opportunity to come before the redress board. My objective of speedy enactment was shared by Opposition Deputies and that belief was fortified by parliamentary questions on 1 February, 7 March, 2 May and 12 June, each of which sought a timetable for setting up a compensation scheme and sought reasons for what was described as a delay in publishing the Bill. The questions came from Deputies Jim O'Keeffe, Seamus Healy and Michael D. Higgins, the latter at the nomination of Deputy Shortall. I am surprised, therefore, to be asked to slow the passage of the Bill. I do not consider that the work of the committee and the completion of its report should delay consideration of this Bill, as to do so would unreasonably delay the setting up of the redress scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To delay the enactment of this Bill would unreasonably delay the setting up of the redress scheme and the commencement of the task of making awards to those who suffer the effects of abuse. I remind those who feel they will not be able to influence the regulations that both Houses will, in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, have an opportunity to debate the report and any regulations made arising from it and may annul any regulations. This strikes a good balance between the need to move forward speedily and accountability to this House. It is a normal balance in such circumstances. The Bill provides for an appeal to a review committee by a claimant against an award. The appeal will be a full re-examination of the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some have argued that claimants should have the right of appeal to the High Court. Given the nature of this compensation scheme, I do not agree. Involvement of the court in this scheme would blur the distinction between formal court proceedings and the compensation scheme and significantly dilute one of the main benefits of a compensation scheme &ndash; expeditious resolution of claims. In establishing this compensation scheme, the State is providing survivors of abuse, <Col N="282" /> who would experience very significant delays and uncertainties in civil litigation, with a quick and effective alternative to civil litigation. Essentially, a claimant will, through the compensation scheme, be offered a quick and accessible route to reasonable compensation for abuse and its resulting damage. This route will have none of the formal panoply of the court. Further, the level of inquiry made by this route into the facts of the claimant's history will be considerably less onerous, as will his or her own cross-examination. In the circumstances it is proposed that this scheme will stand alone outside the normal litigation process.</P>
    <P>I stress that the proposed scheme in no way interferes with a potential claimant's right to bring his or her claim to court. A potential claimant need not access this scheme at all. If he or she does, then once an award is made it will be a matter for the claimant to either accept or reject it. If he or she rejects it, then he or she may pursue his or her civil claim in the normal way through the courts. Where a claimant accepts an award, he or she will be required to enter into an agreement whereby he or she waives any right of action which the claimant might otherwise have had, arising out of the same circumstances, against the State or any party who has contributed to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill before this House today is unprecedented, not just in this jurisdiction. The measures taken by the Irish Government in respect of past abuse are more advanced than in any other jurisdiction of which we are aware. There are concerns as to past abuse in other countries such as Canada, United Kingdom and Australia. These all have significant and ongoing measures and proposed measures to address the problems experienced by people who suffered abuse in childhood. It is important that we recognise that today this Government is going beyond the current models of best practice, to take a new initiative to address the needs of affected people.</P>
    <P>We have examined and dealt with the legal issues arising, and we have committed ourselves to meet the financial burden which this Bill will impose. I hope that all sides of the House will appreciate the spirit in which the Government has taken these actions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like, through this House, to speak to people who as children suffered abuse while they were in institutional care. I know that anyone, who has not shared the experience of child abuse cannot fully appreciate the pain it causes. I know, as we all do, that we cannot turn back the clock and make right what was wrong. What we can do is to acknowledge that wrong and provide material supports so that people who still suffer the ravages of an abused childhood can be helped to continue with their lives. With this Bill the Government is providing another building block for people who need to rebuild their lives.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the comments of Deputies and to the debate on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>During my time as a public representative and in my short time with the Education portfolio I have never come across an issue that is more difficult, emotionally raw and as upsetting as this. The Taoiseach's apology on 11 May 1999 was a brave start in the attempt to right a wrong inflicted on innocent victims who have suffered throughout their lives. I have met and consulted extensively with victims and on each occasion I have come away extremely upset by the stories of wrongs done to them. No legislation, however well intentioned, can right the wrong. It is essential therefore that we proceed on a basis of honest endeavour and that we ensure that legislation passed will go as far as possible to right those wrongs. I do not expect however that financial compensation will ever be enough.</P>
      <P>It is important to try to come to terms with the numbers involved. The Minister estimated in the region of 3,000 victims from residential institutions. Since the 1940s around 34,000 people have passed through these institutions and we must make every effort to ensure that the content and availability of compensation are brought to the attention of the widest number possible. We cannot right the wrong inflicted on these people through financial compensation alone.</P>
      <P>I support the principle of the Bill which I believe has many flaws. Fine Gael will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but it will bring forward substantial amendments on Committee Stage and I hope the Government will approach Committee Stage in a spirit of co-operation and endeavour to ensure that the legislation is the best possible.</P>
      <P>While the Taoiseach's apology was a good start, the bona fides of the Government are questionable in many respects on the content of the Bill as presented and I will deal with those shortcomings later. It is important to highlight the types of abuse we are talking about. Horrid physical abuse ranged from beatings to starvation and humiliation. The psychological and emotional trauma of these has lasted all through the lives of the victims and continues to today. Sexual abuse of the most degrading, humiliating and upsetting nature we can imagine took place. This Bill will attempt to right all of those wrongs but no amount of words or money can adequately comfort these people. However, it is important that we make the best attempt we can to do so.</P>
      <P>There are substantial flaws in the Bill. The title highlights the importance of language in this debate. This Bill is a significant shift in terms of the tribunal originally promised. There is no explanation in the Minister's address as to why we have now rowed back from the commitment in the Taoiseach's apology to a tribunal of compensation. I can accept the argument that the less formal fora where a case can be presented makes things easier for the victims but we need checks and balances on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outright refusal of the Minister to contemplate the provision of a right of appeal to the courts for victims who feel their grievances have <Col N="284" /> not been adequately addressed in the initial informal process exposes the Bill and calls into question the commitment of the Minister and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The concept of victims as residents causes offence to many. They were incarcerated, and for reasons which are difficult to believe in the Ireland of the twenty first century. Many were incarcerated for very minor offences. Nor did the residences resemble Jury's Hotel. They were, in many respects, prisons and we should recognise this fact.</P>
    <P>The lasting stigma of a criminal record is not removed by the Bill. It is time this wrong was righted. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 6 November asking him &ldquo;if in the context of the Government's proposals to compensate victims of abuse in institutional settings his Department has given any consideration to the revocation of the criminal status of the residents in these institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;. Suffice to say the Minister's reply was disappointing. He refers to the Children Act, 2001, but there is no proposal to wipe the slate clean. I ask the Minister to consult again with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue. Many were incarcerated for crimes which today do not merit a criminal record and many for no crime at all. That wrong needs to be righted.</P>
    <P>In an effort to divert substantial numbers of victims of abuse away from this mechanism and into the courts, the Minister has failed to extend the statute of limitations so that when the Bill has finally passed and the victims have an opportunity to see the colour of the Government's money and assess the commitment behind its fine words, they will be able to decide whether to avail of the scheme or to go to court. When the Bill has passed all Stages and victims are in a position to adjudicate on whether its provisions are adequate for their individual needs, they should then have the right to pursue their cases through the courts, if they find the legislation inadequate. The manner in which the Government acted is at least unfair and at worst calculated to minimise the amount of compensation paid. I ask the Government to reconsider extending the statute of limitations which is a safety net for victims.</P>
    <P>We debate this Bill under duress. The Minister has referred to the compensation advisory committee which has been established and to parliamentary questions which have been tabled in an attempt to bring the legislation forward in the House as quickly as possible. The Opposition has done what the Minister says. The Taoiseach made his apology in May 1999, two and a half years ago. This represents an undue delay. The Government has given no indication of the amount of money it is prepared to put up-front to compensate the victims. The Government has decided to follow the example of compensation mechanisms in Canada, where the matrix approach further dehumanises victims. Sufficient <Col N="285" /> previous experience is available in the courts at present to adjudicate on appropriate compensation levels on an individual basis rather than using a slide rule mechanism to assess the number of times a victim was physically assaulted, raped or buggered and to calculate appropriate compensation. The Minister's failure to show the House the extent of the Government's financial commitment is an insult to the victims.</P>
    <P>There is considerable difference of opinion about whether day pupils should be included in the compensation mechanism. Some of that division is fuelled by fear that the compensation cake is of a certain size and if the compensation mechanism is opened to all victims there will be less money for each one. That is why Fine Gael was not in favour of debating Second Stage and why we will oppose the taking of Committee stage until the Government nails its colours to the mast. The Minister has said the House will have adequate opportunity by way of regulation to examine the compensation mechanism. We all know that regulation is a device for hoodwinking the Oireachtas and the public about critically important detail.</P>

      <P>Regulations are laid before the House but how many times have they been rescinded? Even if these regulations were debated the Government majority would ensure they were not rescinded. Why does the Minister not allow compensation to be dealt with on an individual basis, as is done in the courts? We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. It is no wonder there is concern among victims who fear that the extension of compensation to day pupils would diminish the entitlement of individual victims. The compensatory advisory committee is still conducting hearings among victims' representative groups and this is very useful work. However, it would be unfair to the House and to the victims to pursue Committee Stage until the advisory committee's report is available to us. I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue.</P>
      <P>In recent days various organisations have asked Members to speed up the passage of this legislation. My reply to them has been that we are anxious to ensure that the system is up and running as soon as possible but when the committee reports and the regulations are finalised, I do not want to see victims receiving awards which are not compatible with High Court awards, as they should be. I do not want to countenance a situation where when the committee reports and the regulations are finalised, victims will find that, ultimately, they will not get their just rewards, which should be compatible with the levels of awards pertaining in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will give the Bill proper parliamentary scrutiny and not delay it unduly. Some of the groups I met are anxious that at least some preliminary payments will be made to victims before Christmas. With the best will in the world that is <Col N="286" /> unlikely to happen. However, while I understand their anxiety, victims would not thank us for buying a pig in a poke when we do not see the colour of the Government's money.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have raised the issue of funding for the organisations concerned with the Minister and his colleague, the Minster for Health and Children. They represent to the best of their ability the needs and concerns of individual victims who are proposed to be compensated in the legislation. Some are in receipt of funding, which is welcome. However, others are involved in travelling throughout the country and the United Kingdom and are in contact with victims in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. They have received no money from the State.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the reason some representative groups have been excluded from funding? I have received correspondence from numerous groups in the United Kingdom, such as the Federation of Irish Societies in London and the London Irish Women Survivors' Support Group, which are anxious about the content of the legislation and wish to contribute to the Committee Stage debate. However, they work on a shoestring and there is a danger they will be unable to reach the maximum possible number of victims who will be entitled to benefit under the legislation, except in so far as they receive some funding. Similar considerations apply to organisations based in this country.</P>
    <P>The cynics might argue it is the Government's intention to pass the legislation, implement its provisions on a shoestring and terminate the arrangements envisaged after three years because the maximum possible numbers affected will not have been contacted. The Minister should allay this fear. A small amount of money would fund these organisations and enhance their capacity to reach the victims. It would also defuse one of many arguments concerning the shortcomings of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Most of my contact has been with male victims, but a UK organisation which has contacted me represents London Irish women survivors. There must be substantial numbers abroad, including those forced to emigrate and those who felt they could no longer stay here. They must be reached in a proactive manner. Organisations are struggling with their obligations in this area because of the lack of funding. The Minister must consider this issue and deal with previous representations I have made to him.</P>
    <P>With regard to the institutions to be covered under the legislation, it should be possible to expect from the Department a list of all the institutions where residents were incarcerated and where it is intended that they would be entitled to compensation if they can prove their case. It should be appended to the legislation. Questions arise regarding the women in the Magdalen laundries. Some of the stories we were told were horrendous. The women in the laundries should be entitled to compensation. Some were unaware of the fact that, in theory, they were free to leave, <Col N="287" /> but were under lock and key. The Minister should clarify this aspect. Horrendous stories have also circulated concerning people with disabilities in orthopaedic hospitals involving their use almost as guinea pigs in drug trials. The Minister should clarify their entitlement to compensation. The State also failed in its supervisory duty to those in foster care. This aspect must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>The most contentious aspect of this issue is the exclusion of day pupils from the provisions of the legislation. I tend to agree with the argument that these were victims of abuse also and that it is invidious to differentiate. The Minister has offered no cogent legal argument for their exclusion other than whisperings about the opening of the floodgates. That is insufficient reason to exclude these victims of abuse. I have given this matter careful consideration and I am aware that the Church shares my view. For understandable reasons the Church is, in many respects, not held in the highest regard by representatives of the victims, but there is a need to consider this matter in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of legal rulings in the United Kingdom, especially the House of Lords case, Lister and Others <i>v. </i>Hesley Hall Limited of 3 May 2001, where the concept of vicarious liability was raised. This matter must be considered in greater detail and the Minister must advise the House of the coherent legal basis on which the Government is closing the door on victims of abuse in day schools. The State had a significant role in terms of compulsion to attend day schools. For example, it obliged children who were abused in day schools to attend them, had a responsibility to supervise staff and in many cases paid the staff. In view of this, the Minister should deal with the issue of vicarious liability, as dealt with in the United Kingdom by the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>We should also take account of the Ireland of today and the Ireland of the 1940s, 1950, 1960s and 1970s, especially in the area of corporal punishment. Regrettably, schoolchildren returning home from school in that era were probably clattered again if they told of a clatter they received for alleged misbehaviour. Fortunately, that era has changed significantly. Corporal punishment was abolished in the early 1980s and while schools may have struggled with discipline since, that is no argument for its reintroduction. It was a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>While it is invidious to exclude any victim from a proper scheme of compensation, it should be possible to provide a reasoned basis for including, as exceptional cases, pupils who attended State schools and were sexually abused. Given the different values pertaining in earlier decades on the question of corporal punishment, it will be more difficult to argue that abuse then established an entitlement, but we should be prepared to consider the issue of compensation for victims of sexual abuse in day schools as a once-off issue. <Col N="288" /> On a once-off basis we should be looking at compensating victims of sexual abuse in day schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science in announcing this measure identified why conventional court proceedings are not in the interests of survivors of childhood abuse having regard to a number of factors including delay, uncertainty, publicity and cost. Surely the measure could be expanded to cover that limited class of persons, i.e., those whose abuse was sexual and who by virtue of the amended statute of limitations have commenced court proceedings prior to the date of the enactment of the legislation. From the perspective of the Department of Finance this would necessarily be a limited class, and as the State is a defendant in the proceedings in any event, the speedy &ndash; I use the Minister's words and arguments &ndash; and more informal procedures of the redress board would represent a saving to public finances.</P>
    <P>There is also an argument about <i>in loco parentis</i>. The rationale in the case of residential places is that children were in the care of the State rather than their parents. The logic appears to be that had they been in the care of their parents and been abused, the parents would have intervened. The reality, as the Minister is aware, is that until relatively recently a child making an allegation of sexual misconduct against a teacher was more likely to be punished for making the allegation than to have the allegation investigated. Regrettably, this was the culture of the time and it is unfair to assume in hindsight that the fact children were in their parents' care amounted to any protection in the climate of dominance of the educational establishment over and above parents. It is also a clearly accepted fact that victims of sexual abuse do not report it at the time it occurs, partly because of the domination exercised over them by their abusers. This was the precise rationale for extending the statute of limitations. This is a solid argument, some of which is based on the Minister's argument, in terms of the informal redress proceedings and why we should again think about this area. It will not open the floodgates and there is a case to include at least sexual as opposed to physical abuse which occurred in day schools. There was a different approach to corporal punishment prior to its abolition, but we could at least make a case for victims of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Many of the institutions involved have expressed concern about the level of proof. If an individual is alleged to have been an abuser before the redress board, and a finding is made in fact that the victim is entitled to compensation, will the accused be contacted and know of the allegation? There is an understandable fear that people could well be maligned in the wrong and in terms of natural justice they should be entitled to defend themselves. There is also a very serious issue in terms of section 22. Where the redress board reaches a conclusion on the basis of information presented that a person is entitled to com<Col N="289" /> pensation on the basis of the allegations made, section 22 provides that the information used to reach that decision will in some way be isolated from the public domain and cannot be used in any other forum. What will happen if the perpetrator of abuse is still in the employment of the State or an institution and is involved in the supervision or teaching of children? Will the State have its hands tied by virtue of this Bill whereby it cannot take action against a person it has found to be a perpetrator of abuse? This issue needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>There is a provision under section 20 that persons or institutions may contribute to the fund. What developments have there been in the context of this provision and who is providing funding? We do not know the colour of the Government's money or if anybody else is providing funding. CORI, for example, is in negotiation with the State according to a reply I received to a parliamentary question. Have those negotiations been concluded or are we expected to buy into this Bill without knowing the Minister's commitment or the commitment by others who have indicated a willingness to contribute?</P>
    <P>The provision that where a victim accepts an award he is obliged to sign an agreement of some sort saying he will not take a civil case against the perpetrator is quite incredible. Religious institutions will get a hard press as a result of this, but there are bad apples in every barrel &ndash; one can find them in this House and in religious institutions &ndash; and it would be wrong to malign all of them with a broad brush approach. We are dealing with the actions of an undetermined number in terms of the overall percentage, but why is the victim obliged to allow the perpetrator off scot free? The victim will get compensation but there will be no prosecution of the person who perpetrated the abuse. This is an extraordinary concession to perpetrators of physical and sexual abuse. What negotiations took place between the Department of Education and Science and representatives of various religious institutions in this regard? This is a sweeping measure which allows perpetrators go scot free from the grasp and clutches of the legal system.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Until such time as the Minister for Education and Science publishes a draft of the regulations proposed to be made by him under section 15 specifying the amount to be awarded in respect of various categories of abuse and injury suffered by children in residential institutions, Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with one of the darkest periods in the history of the State. The intention of the Bill is to finally address the widespread physical and sexual abuse that was inflicted on many children in residential institutions in the State over many years. For decades the victims of this abuse have endured a silent and enduring nightmare. The crimes committed against them were ignored and excused. The State, on whose behalf these institutions operated, failed in its duty to uphold the most basic rights of children detained in these institutions. For many years the effective situation was that the rule of law stopped at the gates of these institutions. Appalling abuse was committed behind these gates and no action was taken.</P>
      <P>A strange double think operated in society about the operation of industrial schools and reformatories. It would be wrong to think people did not know that at the very least appalling physical treatment was meted out to very many residents. This knowledge existed but was never detailed or investigated. For decades the human and legal rights of children sent to these institutions were officially ignored on a number of levels. The culture of the time, which automatically conferred unquestioning respect on religious orders and other authority figures in society, compounded the hurt and alienation of those victims. Not only did they have no one to whom to turn when suffering abuse in reformatories and industrial schools, but the legacy of this abuse was ignored by society in general when they left those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children sent to residential institutions never had a chance. The State, religious bodies and wider society have a serious responsibility to face in this regard. In recent years some of the truth about what happened in those institutions has emerged. Paddy Doyle's book <i>The God Squad</i> broke the official silence around this issue for many decades. More information has come out in recent years and it is correct to say that the documentary shown on RTE &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; has played a significant role in bringing the reality of the horror inflicted on children in the past to the <Col N="291" /> attention of the House, the Government and wider Irish society. The Laffoy commission is charged with reviewing and reporting on the dark history of childhood abuse. Its report is eagerly awaited.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is another part of the package of measures to address the State's failings to protect its most vulnerable citizens in the past. It establishes two bodies, a residential institutions board to make awards and a residential institutions redress committee to function as an appeals body to review rewards. The Government and, in particular, its senior civil servants and legal advisers faced a very difficult task in establishing a mechanism to recognise and compensate victims of past abuse in State institutions. It was correct to separate the more investigative work being undertaken by the Laffoy commission from the most individual cases addressed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have a number of criticisms and questions about the Bill. I will preface my remarks with an acknowledgment of the task that faced the Government in establishing a fair mechanism to deal with the abuses of the past. I appreciate that there is little international precedence for the process we have initiated and there is no easy blueprint available from other jurisdictions. The issues addressed by the Bill are deeply personal for hundreds of citizens throughout the State. I will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage and will also be asking the Minister to respond to a number of points at the conclusion of Second Stage. I hope he will give serious consideration to contributions of all speakers in the debate. While we all recognise the difficulties involved in dealing with the issue and, given the regard and acknowledgment for the Opposition in addressing it, I hope there will be the same reciprocal approach on behalf of the Minister in terms of issues and questions raised by Opposition Deputies because no one has a monopoly of wisdom in this most complex matter.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Second Stage amendment I have just outlined. Sections 14 and 15 refer to the setting down by regulation of guidelines for awards. These sections are a crucial aspect of the Bill. The mechanism outlined is fundamentally flawed and the House is being asked to pass legislation related to the compensation of victims of physical and sexual abuse in residential institutions without any knowledge of what the general guidelines for compensation will be. I do not object to the process for establishing these guidelines. The Bill outlines that a body of experts will be appointed who will report to the Minister on the amount of awards to be paid in different circumstances. My objection is that when the expert group reports the Minister will then make regulations regarding the level of award. These regulations will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but will not be debated by the House unless a motion specifically negating them is passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> For a Bill specifically dealing with the compensation scheme to be passed by the House without any knowledge of the levels of compensation payable is wrong. The level of compensation is a crucial aspect of the Bill. Limiting the democratic scrutiny of the levels of compensation by introducing the scheme through ministerial regulation is not right. The amendment in my name seeks to delay Second Stage until the levels of compensation submitted by the expert group and proposed by the Minister are laid before the House and debated. This will not cause a long delay in the passage of the legislation through the House. However, it is a necessary and important step and I urge the Minister not to force a division on the matter and to accept the logic and rationale behind the amendment.</P>
    <P>I now refer to a crucial aspect of the Bill, that is, the exclusion of day pupils. There is no basis for this decision in law. It has been motivated more by an attempt to limit the exposure of the State to the costs involved. In doing so the Minister has overlooked the genuine needs of those who suffered serious abuse in institutions which happened to be day schools but for which his Department had at least regulatory authority. The Taoiseach's apology applied to all those who suffered abuse. The Minister has already accepted that the Laffoy commission includes all who suffered abuse, regardless of whether the institution was residential or a day school. We know abuse took place in day schools which were under the authority of the Department of Education and Science. That Department paid teachers' salaries and was responsible for inspection. The State, therefore, has a clear liability for the serious abuse which took place in day schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply to several parliamentary questions on this matter does not stand up. He tries to suggest that because children in day schools went home to their parents in the evening they automatically had the protection of their parents. This line completely misreads the circumstances of the times about which we are talking. Does he not accept that in the Ireland of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s it would have been unthinkable for anyone to suggest that any authority figure, particularly a religious authority figure, had abused him or her? Any child would have been too frightened to even suggest such an occurrence. This line also denies the effect of child abuse on the victim which is, as we know, that it leads to deep fear and shame. Such an allegation, in the context of the culture of the period, would have been more likely to lead to more severe punishment rather than any investigation of the allegations made.</P>
    <P>There are several well documented cases of serious abuse inflicted on children in day schools. We know that in primary schools 11 teachers have been convicted of sexual abuse while in secondary schools, five teachers have been convicted. Many of these abusers had multiple victims. The victims have already had to relive their appalling abuse by giving evidence in court in <Col N="293" /> these cases. There can be no basis whatsoever for excluding such victims from a compensation scheme. I defy the Minister to come up with an acceptable basis for that decision. What possible justification can he give for forcing these victims to go through the trauma, expense and heartache of a further court case in a civil suit? The overriding principle in any approach to redress must be to ensure no further harm is done to victims but it seems this principle has been dispensed with in the case of pupils of day schools. It is clearly wrong that people who suffered serious abuse while in schools funded by the Minister's Department should be excluded like this.</P>
    <P>In announcing this Bill the Minister has already identified why conventional court proceedings are not in the interests of survivors of childhood abuse, including factors such as delay, uncertainty, publicity and costs. It should be possible, as a minimum, to include these survivors where abuse has already been proven in the courts and those who, by virtue of the amended statute of limitations, have commenced legal proceedings prior to the enactment of this Bill. Moreover, the conduct in question, child sexual abuse, was at all times a criminal offence and it follows, in natural justice, that the victims of such crimes should not be at any loss whatsoever.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the abusers were paid from public funds, there is a clear moral obligation on the State to provide compensation for their victims. The excuse that schools were, overwhelmingly, privately owned, as the Minister has said in reply to parliamentary questions, is a complete distortion of the basis for this compensation scheme. The term &ldquo;privately owned&rdquo; means owned by the hierarchy, in the vast majority of cases the Catholic hierarchy. The redress scheme, as presented in this Bill, is a joint attempt on the part of church and State to provide redress to those people who suffered abuse while in their care and it is very disingenuous on the part of the Minister to attempt to pass the buck in this manner. I strongly urge the Minister to rethink this aspect of the Bill before he compounds the grievous wrongs done to many survivors of sexual abuse in day schools. I will table amendments on this aspect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the context of the exclusion of day pupils from this compensation scheme, the Minister is aware that many of the victims have already made it clear they will not participate in the Laffoy Commission until such time as they are included under this redress scheme. The intention of the Laffoy Commission is to carry out a thorough inquiry into our dark past in this regard and to come up with an account of what happened at the time. That is central to coming to terms, on behalf of the State and on behalf of the many survivors of the institutions concerned, so that we have a clear account of the facts of what actually happened in that period. If we do not have the participation of the pupils of day schools in the Laffoy Commission, it will be an incomplete <Col N="294" /> account. For that reason also, I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>I also seek assurances from the Minister that some other categories of survivors will be included under the terms of this Bill. There are many persons who, due to disability, were placed in orthopaedic hospitals and who, if they had not been disabled, would have been resident in industrial schools and reformatories. These hospitals were run by religious congregations in the main and funded by the State. I ask the Minister to confirm that these people will be included and, similarly, those people who were placed in foster care by the State or religious organisations and whose foster parents were paid by the Department of Health. Survivors in this category sometimes endured sustained abuse by foster parents when they were still the responsibility of the State. Will the Minister now confirm that these people will be included?</P>
    <P>The survivors who transferred from other institutions or were placed by the State or other bodies, sometimes religious organisations, in the Magdalen laundries, should also be included. We need clarification that those people will be included under the terms of this Bill. Many of the girls taken into the Magdalen laundries remained there after the age of 18 and many into old age. Although these women may have had the legal right to leave the laundries, they were certainly not aware of this right. They were not allowed to leave without the consent of the nuns in charge and there are many examples of women escaping and being brought back under police escort. While the Bill deals with childhood abuse <i>per se</i>, there is a clear onus on the State to make reparation to these women for the abuse inflicted on them in those laundries.</P>
    <P>I now turn to other ways in which the State should seek to provide compensation to survivors, other than through the proposed redress board. First, the level of counselling is wholly inadequate to meet the needs of survivors. While counselling was promised, the reality has been that survivors' groups have had to fight for this all the way. Far greater financial provision needs to be made for these essential services. The motivating principle which should be followed by the Minister is that these people, who have already suffered horrendous trauma, should not have to suffer any further. The fact that survivors' groups have had such a battle to secure any level of funding for counselling services is an indication that that principle is just not being followed. Given the scale of the problems which the survivors' groups have had to deal with and the huge practical and logistical problems they have had to overcome, the Minister should, as a matter of urgency, look at the funding he has provided for these groups. There does not seem to be any logic to the manner in which that funding has been provided and some groups have lost out very badly through decisions made in the Department.</P>
    <P>There is also a great need for practical help and support. This is particularly true in relation to vic<Col N="295" /> tims who fled Ireland in an attempt to put behind them the abuses they had suffered. Many survivors ended up living in the UK, trying to cope with the devastating long-term effects of the abuse. Many of these people require assistance in accessing the commission of inquiry and the proposed redress board and many now wish to return home in their old age. That practical assistance should be made readily available to them.</P>
    <P>The issue of educational deprivation is a major factor for many survivors. The devastating effects of childhood abuse, combined with the widespread use of child labour in industrial schools, often meant that the quality of the child's education was one of the main casualties of institutional life. The neglect of these rights to education resulted in many survivors being unable to take up good quality employment and had an extremely negative effect on many aspects of their lives. I urge the Minister to consider establishing an education trust to facilitate survivors to participate in second chance education as a means of compensating them for the many missed educational opportunities of their childhood.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the legal basis for this Bill, in relation to which a number of concerns have been raised. It is incumbent on the Minister to respond to those concerns and to clarify the position in that regard. It is the job of the Opposition to scrutinise proposed legislation and to ensure that it is constitutionally sound. I wish to raise a number of concerns in that regard. We all want to see redress being made as quickly as possible, we want to get this Bill passed and to have the redress board up and running. However, it is not in anybody's interests, particularly the interests of survivors, if we rush the Bill through the House and set up the board but then run into a constitutional challenge to the board some months down the road resulting in the board being delayed, possibly indefinitely. It is essential that we have absolute clarity on Second Stage on the legal basis for this Bill. We will deal with some of the legal aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage, but it would be helpful for the Minister to clarify a number of points now.</P>
    <P>The approach that has been taken in this Bill is similar to the hepatitis C tribunal, it is an attempt at a no-fault compensation scheme. I wonder if that is the right approach. It was easy enough to establish such a scheme for those who had contracted hepatitis C. All the claimants had to do was to prove the presence of antibodies in their blood and the fact that they had once received a blood transfusion, both of which are capable of objective verification.</P>
    <P>However, that bears no comparison to these circumstances. In this case, the idea of compensation being paid to victims of criminal abuse alleged to have been committed by what will in many cases be identified individuals without any notice to those individuals or requirement to repeat the allegations in front of those individuals and without any opportunity for those individuals <Col N="296" /> to rebut the charges made against them, raises fundamental constitutional issues. Because we all want to see this compensation board operational as quickly as possible, the Minister must clarify those constitutional issues at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The difference between the hepatitis tribunal and this one is that this is not a no-fault proposal. Fault is at the heart of it. If there was no fault, in the sense of culpability, there would be no cause for compensation and no need for a tribunal. However, what this tribunal proposes to deal with is fault as alleged and subsequently presumed and accepted rather than fault found as fact. The act is presumed and accepted to have been committed possibly by somebody who will be named who is not there and has no opportunity to contest the assertion. Essentially the Government seems to envisage a system whereby the name and reputation of an individual could be, and more than likely will be, defenceless against attack in a forum provided by the State because the allegedly guilty individual will not be there and will not be told what is being said against him or her.</P>
    <P>I accept that constitutional rights are not absolute and sometimes balancing exercises are required. The net question is whether the vindication of the rights of those abused as children in institutions, inadequately supervised by the State, requires, in lieu of claims against the State litigated in the courts, the payment to them of <i>ex gratia</i> awards consequent on their having first made uncontested allegations, which would of their nature be likely to be controverted by those against whom they are made, to a tribunal that is not charged with rigorously and impartially investigating the truth of those claims and which does not afford any standing to those with an interest in disputing them. These are fundamental constitutional issues and the Minister must clarify them before we move to the next stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed from a number of sources that the Government has drifted into error in the details of the scheme as drawn up and that it is not possible to improve it by mere tweaking. It is also claimed that this proposal is fundamentally flawed from both a constitutional and a public policy point of view. If there is a basis for those claims, we need the Minister to give clarification on those as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We are told that under the provisions of the Bill confidentiality will be assured. What are the obligations of the members of the board and the members of the appeals committee in the event of them hearing of allegations of abuse carried out by persons who are currently involved in the provision of services to children where they may be posing an ongoing danger to those children. In other cases, people in State employment have a clear obligation to report. Surely we cannot allow those employed by the State as members of the redress board, who, in possession of information of individuals having abused in the past and knowing that those individuals may still pose a serious danger to children on an ongoing basis, <Col N="297" /> not to have a legal and certainly a moral obligation to report that.</P>
    <P>One of the main aspects in terms of dealing with institutional abuse is to ensure that we learn lessons from the past. That implies that we establish a level of accountability for those who have been the perpetrators of that abuse. I have serious concerns that the approach proposed by the Minister does not seek to establish accountability. What is proposed is a compensation tribunal. However it can be seen as an amnesty for those who were involved in abuse in State institutions. Putting it baldly, religious orders, by making a contribution to a compensation scheme, will ensure, through the provisions of the Bill, that those who suffered abuse will not take civil actions against their abusers. In my view that is an amnesty. It is not the right way to deal with past abuse.</P>
    <P>Those who have carried out the abuse will not be made accountable and will not be required to be brought to justice. That is a serious flaw in the approach being taken by the Government. It will not add to our general knowledge about this era. If this process is to mean anything, it must bring to account those who inflicted such appalling abuse on the victims, establish a clear mechanism of accountability and provide assurances that such abuse will not happen in the future. It does not offer that assurance.</P>
    <P>There are many questions raised by this proposal and there is an urgent need for clarification by the Minister on some fundamental aspects of it. I look forward to his summing up and I will be tabling amendments to cover the issues raised on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>It is clearly very difficult to address in a meaningful way the appalling abuse inflicted on children in various institutions over the period in question. The Minister and his officials have gone a considerable way towards addressing those fundamental problems. It is clear that an element of financial recompense is important in that it is an acknowledgement that very serious wrong was done to these people. It also may be of some help in setting them up for the remainder of their lives. For many of them, that acknowledgement is the most important element. It is important, also, to remember that many of these people need dedicated counselling, a support mechanism and considerable help towards recovery from the appalling experiences which some of them endured. The aims and the outlook of the legislation should be to set them up in a way that they have not been heretofore, to acknowledge that they were wronged, and to go some way towards restoring their self-worth which has been undermined considerably. In that regard, I commend Deputies Creed and Shortall <Col N="298" /> for their balanced approach to the subject. I suspect they have both formally met some of the groups which work on behalf of those who need this legislation. I have not met them formally but, like other Deputies, I received written submissions, and I met individuals. Something that strikes me is that their approaches are dissimilar as are their individual experiences. The fundamental point is that they need an acknowledgement that they were badly treated and they need recompense for that.</P>
      <P>A worry, that this debate inevitably throws up, is whether we are currently taking care to ensure that similar abuses do not happen. There is much evidence that the family home is not a safe place for many children. Is there more that the State can do? An upshot of what we are doing, and attempting to do, may be to make it more difficult for voluntary bodies to continue to make constructive input in this area while the State is not prepared to pick up the slack.</P>
      <P>A most important development, for the people whom I know, was the acknowledgement in May 1999 by the Taoiseach of their treatment and his expression of regret on behalf of society. I was surprised at the impact of that. We must remember that public authorities of one kind or another, but mainly Departments, had the ultimate responsibility for these children's welfare. They were responsible for some going into the institutions and in all cases had the ultimate responsibility for taking reasonable measures to ensure that they were safe and secure. It is clear that the children were not, although the Kennedy committee's work in 1970, which is forgotten by many, was important and constructive and made significant progress.</P>
      <P>The points made by Deputies Creed and Shortall about abuse in day schools and other institutions must be addressed, but the Minister may be correct in not doing so in this legislation as it is extremely difficult. However, some day it must be addressed and, in the short-term, must be addressed in the cases of those who can prove that they were abused. We cannot say the State has no responsibility because it had a fundamental involvement.</P>
      <P>We can learn valuable lessons from other jurisdictions, such as a similar case in Nova Scotia, from which we could learn about redress for the people who were mistreated, and the manner in which the State tried to make recompense. We must also take account of the concerns of the religious orders, take on board what they say, and facilitate their involvement in providing compensation. Politicians know better than most that the sins of the few are visited on all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as tribunals were set up to establish the truth, so the work of the Laffoy commission must be facilitated and nothing must prevent people from having their cases and experiences examined with the facts placed on the public record. Then the dark days of our history will be formally addressed. The experience of the relatively small number whom I know that will be affected by this <Col N="299" /> legislation suggests that some of those among the religious responsible for them treated them well, and made up to some degree for the appalling damage inflicted by others. That distinction must be drawn when this dark age is finally exposed to the light of the modern world.</P>
    <P>Further clarity would be helpful in some areas, such as the confidentiality of information that emerges, and, as Deputy Shortall stated, on the constitutional rights to due process of individuals against whom allegations are made. The Minister, on the last occasion, explained the validation process, which is to establish that the person suffered, or suffers, physical or psychological damage which is consistent with the abuse alleged. I understand why that has been chosen and I accept the Minister's point that if one were to await the publication of the findings of the Laffoy commission, it would be too late for some. It would also be detrimental if anything arising from this legislation were to undermine the commission's work, through which the truth in all its ugliness must come out.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the schedule will set out the amount of awards and other criteria. The board has a difficult job in dealing with levels of compensation and in acknowledging the damage done. I hope it will have the right to ensure that there will be further counselling and support, separate from any financial provisions, for the many individuals who need them. The kind of professional help and support that they need is not being made available as quickly as it should be in the required specialities. If that is not addressed, the attempt to restore these persons' dignity will not succeed, and it is as important as financial compensation. The State was responsible for putting some children in this position and was responsible for ensuring that they were all properly treated as citizens.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that the board has responsibility for disbursing public funds in a fair, transparent manner, as with any public funds, and must also preserve confidentiality. There is also a responsibility to ensure that those who visited damage upon children are accountable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on bringing forward this legislation. As other speakers have said, it has been difficult work for them to put the legislation together. It is very difficult legislation to discuss and refers to the darkest days in Irish society. There are implications for people who have left the country and found themselves in a lot of difficulties, particularly Irish people in Great Britain, who have written to Deputies outlining the circumstances they face. Organisations on their behalf have been very active in making those points. The Minister will need the wisdom of Solomon in dealing with this. We have had a lot of correspondence from people who wish to have the legislation enacted as quickly as possible, but there are probably more people who ask that we take <Col N="300" /> time to discuss it and consider the various issues and implications. People feel there is a need to clarify many issues. I hope the Minister will do his best to satisfy all those demands. As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, I have had many representations from Deputies Creed and Shortall to have people and organisations attend our meetings. I hope we can start doing that next week.</P>
      <P>For the first time the Minister is bringing legislation forward to address a comprehensive package of measures for survivors of abuse in various institutions. I welcome that he has talked not only about the need to provide financial recompense and acknowledge the damage done to people, but also about assisting the recovery of people who were resident in these institutions as children. He also talks of the process of rebuilding their lives, that is very important and people from my constituency have talked about the need to go forward. With the redress board to make awards and the redress committee as an appeals body, the Minister is going about his work in the right way. He has said that society owes those who, as vulnerable young children, were committed to care and suffered abuse. The debt that is owed to them is great and the Minister and the Department will deal with that. I refer the Minister to correspondence I received from Right of Place. They referred to amendments which they have put forward. The Minister may give an indication of his view of these amendments in his reply. Right of Place also raised concerns in their submission about day pupils.</P>
      <P>In the correspondence I have received from Right of Place and the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain, I have been struck by the needs and practical help that people are looking for. Many people, particularly older people, wish to return to Ireland. We have very few schemes to help these older people who want to return. Most of the schemes, run by either the local authorities or health boards, are to repair houses and provide accommodation. We have to consider the people who do not have a house or perhaps have no relatives here; there is no priority for people like that. I know of a scheme in Dunmore in County Galway called Homes for the Elderly, and that is the only one I can think of in the county. People who have no family members to return to but who still regard Ireland as their home should get assistance and be given priority. Even though it is the responsibility of the Department for the Environment and Local Government, the Minister might take it up with them to establish if we can have a housing policy that would give priority to older people who suffered abuse as children. The need to provide social workers for those returning has also been raised by these groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 58 industrial schools by the time most of them closed in 1975. There was a terrible legacy for the young people in those schools and the damage done to them will take a long time to heal. Correspondence from the Irish Survivors of Child Abuse points out the religious orders have <Col N="301" /> not given a full answer about the amount of money they are willing to contribute under this Bill. I know the Department has been in negotiations about this. I hope the religious will be generous in their contribution. They made the point in correspondence they sent to Deputies that there are issues other than compensation involved. For example, the need to provide resources for further education of former residents of the institutions. Their presentation also says that former residents should participate in the disbursement mechanisms. That is laudable. As the Minister has said, the religious have been active in providing education over the years and have made a big contribution to society in that area. It would be positive if they were to contribute by looking at the question of further education.</P>
    <P>I was struck by correspondence from the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain. They talked about issues which have particular relevance for victims of child abuse living in Britain. They referred particularly to the Magdalen laundries. I hope that this issue can be looked at on Committee Stage or in the Minister's reply. This difficult issue has been the subject of television and radio programmes. It was raised by Councillor Sally Mulready in correspondence and we should respond to it.</P>
    <P>I thank and congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill forward. There are a lot of issues to be teased out on Committee Stage and many groups are seeking clarification on some of the issues we have discussed. In providing a board and an independent review committee, the Minister has gone about the issue in the right way. I hope his reply will include more information about how the legislation will proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of the most difficult Bills to come before the House in the lifetime of this Government. We hope the Bill will, in some way, redress the wrongs of previous decades.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted James Baldwin who said: &ldquo;Not everything that is faced can be changed but nothing can be changed unless it is faced.&rdquo;  Can we change the lives of those who suffered because of the tyranny they experienced in many of these institutions in the past? While it is acknowledged that redress can be made through compensation in some way, we will not, regardless of how much counselling, financial assistance or other compensation is provided to those who come forward, replace what they have lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people lost their childhood and their dignity and the majority of the 3,000 victims to whom the Minister referred have hidden in society since the 1940s. Only the bravest have come forward and, were it not for their bravery and determination, we would not be responding to their claims with this legislation today. The Minister stated that the legislation is unprecedented. Why did the State down through the years abandon <Col N="302" /> these people and ignore their abuse claims? It is an indictment of all of us that we have ignored the abuse until now and allowed that group to grow from child to adult while enduring these traumas and difficulties when they were young. No matter how the Minister quantifies a particular abuse we can never compensate them and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach apologised for the wrongs that were committed, which was welcome, but apologising in 2001 in no way redresses the ills of the past. My first realisation of the suffering of young people in institutions was when I was a student in Galway city. Every morning I saw them being sent out to milk cows in the fields surrounding the city. I would not have realised anything was happening were it not for the people in charge shouting loudly at these young people, for all the public to hear. One wonders what happened behind the closed doors of that institution in Salthill, Galway. It has only been in recent years that I have become aware of the suffering of so many young people who were abused in similar institutions.</P>
    <P>My greatest fear in regard to the Bill is that the Minister has failed to indicate, except through vague references, what will comprise compensation. I am fearful the Minister, his officials and the review committee will conjure price tags for various forms and degrees of abuse. That would be totally unfair because we do not know what happened. Perhaps the Minister, because of his previous experience in the Jamie Sinnott case, is afraid to outline how much money will be offered if the compensation route is taken. Is he under strict orders from the Minister for Finance because of what happened in regard to Army deafness and other claims? He should be obliged to come back to the House and outline, as a matter of urgency, what he has in mind because there is no way we can agree to him introducing a compensation scheme by regulation, about which we can do nothing. It is unfortunate that this is the tactic he is using to introduce change.</P>
    <P>Many of the Bill's provisions are vague and we will have to wait until Committee Stage to tease them out. The Bill's purpose is &ldquo;to make awards in accordance with the Act in a fair and reasonable way&rdquo;. To whom are we responding and to whom are we being fair and reasonable? The legislation states: &ldquo;The board will not address the issues of fault and negligence.&rdquo;  How can an assessment be made of what is reasonable and fair in a case if fault and negligence cannot be addressed? I do not understand what the Minister and his officials have in mind and this provision is a major drawback in the legislation. I hope we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to address this difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Bill portrays a lack of acceptance by the Minister that the State was to blame in the past. The blame is being put on the institutions which were ruled by tyranny. The victims of these institutions were dispatched by the courts and put away and the State withdrew at that point. There <Col N="303" /> is nothing in the Bill to indicate that the Minister acknowledges the failure of the State to adequately supervise and investigate those institutions. The alarm was not raised by those who suffered but it was raised on numerous occasions by fair-minded people in these institutions who witnessed what was happening. Their claims were ignored by the State. It has taken until the past five years to recognise the abuse that took place, yet claims were made time and again over the years. Were it not for the bravery of those who came forward, we would probably not be doing anything about it during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the chairperson of the proposed board will probably be a former senior member of the Judiciary. The members should ideally be people who are actively involved in the caring professions but we do not know yet how they will be chosen. The composition of this board is crucial to the question of redress. The Minister should indicate at an early stage the composition and membership of the board. The members of the board should be aware of the needs of the applicants for redress. A former senior member of the Judiciary might have experience of dealing with some of those who as young children were committed to those institutions. That could present a difficulty. We must be very careful about the membership of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides that an application may be brought on behalf of any person who would have qualified as an applicant but who died since 11 May 1999. This means that the children or spouse of deceased applicants will have the opportunity to come forward and seek redress and compensation. The children may have experienced the sufferings of their deceased parent. I wonder how they will be able to adequately present a case on behalf of a deceased parent? How can the degree of abuse and suffering be assessed by the board? What evidence would be acceptable to the board for assessment of the compensation involved? Perhaps the Minister will explain why the claim has to be lodged within three years of the establishment date of the board. The applicants have waited and suffered for many years and now it seems unfair that they are given only three years in which to come forward to make their case even though some exceptions are allowed.</P>
    <P>It will take enormous courage on the part of many to come forward. We cannot tell what the mental state is of many of the applicants who are now in middle to old age. They must find the courage and the strength to come forward. Many of them may be in deteriorating health. I suspect that many of them have suffered so much that their health cannot be sufficiently robust to allow them to present their claims. The three-year rule is miserly when compared with the length of time that elapsed before action was taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> Section 9 states that the board will make a preliminary decision that an applicant is entitled to an award and the applicant will then be referred to medical advisers to assess the injuries suffered. This is another layer of bureaucracy which the applicants must endure. Is it fair that the applicant must go through a hearing which is similar to court proceedings? That will be traumatic for them. A medical advisory board will assess the applicant and report to the board. They will say what they believe the injuries are. How can they assess the injuries that manifest themselves today but are a result of what has happened throughout their lifetime? Will the Minister say who will pay the costs in each case?</P>
    <P>When a final assessment is made the applicant has one month in which to accept or reject the ruling. A person who has been through all the trauma of a lifetime of difficulties has only one month in which to make up his or her mind. That is unfair. More time should be allowed for the applicants to assess for themselves whether they are satisfied.</P>
    <P>If this is a first step towards addressing this huge problem, the Minister must be open and transparent in everything he does, not only for the Members of this House but also for the people who have suffered and are living the hell of the past 20 or 30 years. The Minister is on shifting sands if he does not indicate as a matter of urgency what compensation will be available to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Members received correspondence from the Irish Survivors of Child Abuse seeking a delay in the debate on and passage of the Bill. However, I disagree with that suggestion. It is most important that the process of debate on the various Stages of the Bill begins. Members will have an opportunity to tease out the detail of the legislation with the Minister and his officials. Several of the earlier speakers highlighted some of those details and their concerns. However, if we proceed cautiously, bear in mind all the abuse that took place and the experiences that have been outlined to us and remember all the representations that have been made to us, we will end up with a Bill that meets our intentions and deals with the issues that have been raised.</P>
      <P>However, some of the matters raised during the passage of the Bill will have to remain open ended because the sands will shift. During the debate, we will encounter examples of physical and sexual abuse that may cause us to change our approach to certain aspects of the Bill. I appeal to the Minister to have an open mind and to show flexibility during the processing of the Bill to ensure that whatever issues crop up during the debate can be addressed. I ask the Minister to consider these matters with an open mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has shocked everybody in the State. When I first heard about the abuse that occurred in institutions over the years I was amazed that, although it was so widespread and horrific, it had <Col N="305" /> not come to the fore earlier. Having spoken to a number of people who were physically and sexually abused while in institutional care or at day schools, I was struck by the fact that they seemed to shoulder this abuse every day of their lives; it was part of their everyday experiences. They grew up with the abuse and they became prisoners of it. In later years, they hid their past from their partners and children. This discussion will in some way bring about some form of public reconciliation in relation to everything that happened in the past. It will allow the people who were abused to deal with their past and to successfully move on with the next stages of their lives, regardless of their age.</P>
    <P>Having heard such horrific stories, it is difficult to get one's head around the fact that these incidents took place in this country. I am very pleased the Bill has been introduced by the Minister. I was also pleased that, in 1999, the Taoiseach, in response to the public outcry about all the stories of individuals on television and in the print media, apologised on behalf of Irish society. This was a fitting start and having made it, we must accept that it is an unfolding story. We should prepare ourselves in terms of compensation that may have to be paid and support mechanisms that may need to be put in place not only for the individuals concerned but for the families who must deal with issues that arise in the hearings that will take place as a result of the legislation. The Taoiseach's apology and the introduction of the legislation are in marked contrast to the culture that existed from the 1930s on. We are beginning to deal with this issue and we can see the difference in society now.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for financial awards but they are not the answer on their own. Financial awards will be the least of the worries of the people who come forward at the hearings. We will be asked to set compensation levels but there is an underlying need for us to understand that other measures will be necessary to cope with the issues that arise. There may be a need for specialist assistance and that will have to be included in the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, it is important to understand that while this issue relates to various institutions and orphanages and religious orders, the people who were involved do not necessarily represent the general work of religious orders. They were a minority within those orders and many of us who attended schools run by religious orders understand that a small number of people were involved. They did a huge amount of damage but it must be recognised that the general work of religious orders here and abroad was positive. There is a need for balance. We must recognise that although we are dealing with negative aspects, there is a positive side and there were good people.</P>
    <P>I understand the religious orders are currently in discussions with the Government regarding the level of contribution they might make in the area of compensation. I hope this matter will be <Col N="306" /> resolved in the short-term because it was raised by the Irish Survivors of Child Abuse group in the context of the commencement of the debate on the Bill. The Federation of Irish Societies also wrote to Members asking that certain aspects be considered during the debate. One issue relates to disabled survivors who were placed in orthopaedic hospitals. The federation has asked Members to support its recommendation in that regard. Its view is that the hearings must have a wide scope in terms of people having an opportunity to come forward and make claims.</P>
    <P>The federation also wants the issue of the Magdalen laundries to be raised in the context of the Bill. It wants the three main categories of girls and women who were placed in the laundries to be considered. It outlined in its correspondence the need for Members to understand that these women and girls were placed in the Magdalen laundries following transfers from other institutions, such as reformatories or industrial schools and former orphanages. Girls and women between the ages of 16 and 18 years who were transferred having been discharged from institutions into society to work, were picked up and brought to the laundries, often under police escort. A third category was those who remained in the laundries beyond the age of 18 years. Some of them remained there until they died.</P>
    <P>A whole range of people were affected by this type of institutionalisation and abuse in these institutions during those years. They took it on board as part and parcel of their normal lives and the circumstances under which they had to live. We must take those cases into consideration. The federation also refers in its correspondence to the return and repatriation of survivors and victims to Ireland. This aspect should also be considered in the context of the Bill. Many people, who left Ireland for England or further afield during those years, find themselves cut off by virtue of their experience in these institutions and they, too, should be considered in the context of this Bill. The Bill's scope should be widened to encompass all of the people identified by the representative organisations as being entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not consider day pupils in these institutions as they are not considered to have been in the care of the State. This issue must be re-examined. A large number of people are affected by the fact that they were physically and sexually abused while attending school &ndash; I have discussed their cases with many of them. While these students may have lived at home, their parents would have considered them to have been in the State's care. Many of these students suffered horrific abuse in the State's care and the prevailing culture meant that they were afraid &ndash; the fear instilled in them by their abusers &ndash; to tell their parents what happened. The effects of this abuse on these children are the same as on those who were institutionalised. They bear the same psychological scars and have had to live with what happened to them while they were in the care of those representing the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> Having apologised to the victims of institutional abuse and introduced this legislation, it is not acceptable to exclude a body of people, namely day pupils, who suffered similar abuse. They, too, must confront the past on a daily basis and must now revisit it in the context of the debate on this Bill, a Bill which excludes them. I appeal to the Minister to extend the Bill's scope to deal with these people, even if this entails establishing a different compensation procedure to deal with them. Most people are not focusing on the compensation to be awarded; they primarily want the State to acknowledge the abuse they suffered while in institutional care. Day pupils are simply seeking the same treatment. If the State is big enough to apologise, it should be big enough to include everyone who was abused while in care.</P>
    <P>I know equal numbers of people in my constituency who were abused while in institutional care and while attending school as day pupils. They all tell the same horrific stories. All of them want to escape the past and get on with their lives. We, as legislators, owe it to them to provide some manner of compensation or escape from their current imprisonment and allow them to move on with their lives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the legislation provides for the establishment of a compensation tribunal. I note, in a report issued on 18 October, the lack of progress made on the issue of legal costs. A preliminary offer of £650 per case was refused, as was a second offer of £2,500 to £3,800. It is estimated that the compensation process will cost some £4 million. Whatever its cost, society must bear that cost with an understanding of the torture and torment inflicted on these people. However, we must ensure that legal costs do not get out of hand, as has happened with other tribunals. This is an issue to which all of society must contribute. Members of the legal profession should be willing to agree a fixed sum to handle these cases in order that the best possible legal representation can be afforded to everyone while keeping legal costs to a minimum. I would like the greater part of any costs in this area to be provided as compensation to those who were abused rather than to members of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The issue of medical assessment in support of individual cases is referred to in the Bill. Who will bear the costs in this area and how confidential will be the medical opinions offered? Anyone coming before the tribunal should be offered the best possible legal representation and the best means of obtaining medical assessment. Too often, tribunals or similar bodies, become overly bureaucratic. We are asking people to bare their experiences to the tribunal and some will discuss them for the first time. It is important that we offer people appropriate protection without dragging them unnecessarily through their painful pasts.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to revisit the issue of day pupils during the debate on the Bill. I have <Col N="308" /> correspondence concerning the Dunne case and others. Perhaps the Minister would meet the group representing these people or suggest other measures to deal with their cases if they cannot be addressed under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I thank various survivor groups which have fully informed and updated Members of the Oireachtas. I record my thanks to the Right to Peace organisation in south Tipperary, which has kept me up to date on the matter. Such organisations have supported individuals who suffered appalling abuse in residential institutions and their spouses and families. While the abuse suffered by individuals was appalling and traumatic, it has continued effects on spouses and children. Many victims were afforded little education and found it difficult to gain employment when they went out into the world. The impact of the abuse can be seen throughout the lives of the victims and those close to them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill and support its general intent. There are, however, various shortcomings which were fully outlined by Deputies Creed and Shortall and which the Minister, Deputy Woods, should address during the Committee Stage debate on the Bill. The eventual passage of the Bill should help those who suffered from one of the most dark and dismal episodes in the history of this country, involving the abuse of children in institutional and residential care. The Bill should help all concerned and ensure it will never be repeated.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses the fact that 30,000 people born since 1930 were committed to industrial and reform schools, some of them through the courts and some of them because they were orphaned or their families were destitute. Various statistics show us that about 3,000 residents of these institutions suffered appalling and traumatic physical, emotional and sexual abuse. About 10% of cases before the courts refer to the 1930s and 1940s and another 25% refer to the 1950s. We can take it, therefore, that many victims are over the age of 60 years. The State, including the Oireachtas, has taken a long time to address the situation that emerged from the institutions. Some of the needs of the victims have to be encountered to be believed. Those involved want to know the reason they were abused and who abused them. They need financial redress arising from the abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my abhorrence and strong objection to the low journalistic standards of the magazine <i>Magill</i>. There has been an attempt in recent issues to smear and tarnish as criminals individuals who have had appalling experiences. The vast majority of residents of the institutions were <Col N="309" /> orphans or there as a result of destitution. The low journalism employed by <i>Magill</i> has added insult to the injuries suffered in residential institutions.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we closed our eyes to the abuse for years. The fact that we denied its existence is a huge indictment of us all. The courageous individual accounts of those who indicated the extent and nature of the abuse that took place should be admired. Many of them were not believed in years gone by, as people did not think it was possible that such events could have taken place in institutions supported by the State and run by religious orders. The makers of the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; documentary should be thanked for helping to bring this sorry episode into the public domain. The Taoiseach's apology in 1999 was welcome, as was the establishment of the Laffoy commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a package of measures which should address the fact that many individuals were abused. The section of the Bill which deals with awards needs to be amended, however, if it is to be accepted by survivors of abuse, which is essential. It is unacceptable that we are expected to debate the Bill without compensation guidelines being in place. The Minister should ensure such guidelines are introduced before the Bill goes any further.</P>
    <P>Many organisations supporting survivors have indicated the guidelines they would like to see included by the compensation advisory committee. Recommendations include that all awards made to survivors of abuse should be in line with High Court awards. The many years of trauma endured by survivors, which will continue for the rest of their lives, should be taken into account when awards are decided. Importantly, organisations have suggested that all survivors have the right to appeal awards to the High Court. They have also indicated that they are not happy with suggestions that the Canadian matrix be used as a model. The awards should not interfere with survivors' social welfare payments and should take account of loss of earnings. I hope the necessary clarifications and amendments will be introduced by the Minister in the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Bill, I am not satisfied that it goes far enough because it does not provide for compensation for the victims of sexual abuse in national schools. It is essential that these victims be included. It is also essential that victims would have the right to have their case heard in court. Will the Government allow Committee Stage of the Bill be taken in the House rather than in a committee room? Many Members are anxious to have a close examination of the Bill and if it goes to a committee, it will not get the attention it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 May 1999 the Taoiseach, on behalf of the State and all its citizens, apologised to victims of child abuse for our collective failure to intervene. The State's failure in the Donal Dunne case was well documented at the time of the apology. <Col N="310" /> In October 1998 the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, described the Department failures as &ldquo;seriously lacking, even by the standards of the time.&rdquo; Earlier on a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme the same Minister criticised his own Department and termed its inaction as &ldquo;mind-boggling.&rdquo; He was referring to the Donal Dunne case at the time.</P>
    <P>In the Donal Dunne case the State admits that the Department knew that the abuse was taking place. The Noel Conway and Jack Kelly cases are similar in that the abuse took place in primary day schools and the Department knew of it. Parents reported the abuse, but were ordinary poor people with little influence at the time. The response was to transfer the offending teacher to other schools where abuse continued. It is wrong for the State to state it was not aware of what was happening. It was aware and the abuse was just transferred from one place to another. The State knowingly and actively allowed a situation of abuse to continue.</P>
    <P>There was serious physical and sexual abuse involved and the Minister must ensure victims from day schools are compensated fully. It was statutorily imperative for children to attend school. Training, supervision and payment were within the control of the State. In private, the State admits that those children should be included, but is afraid that if they are, the floodgates will open. We should remember that the State was aware of abuse at the time and allowed it to continue. It cannot stand aside now. If a child failed to attend school, he or she was sent to an industrial school which often made matters worse. I urge the Minister to make an exception to ensure children in day schools who were sexually abused can obtain redress. I do not condone the physical abuse of children, but the trauma to sex abuse victims has been so great that there should be compensation. The redress board is expressed to be an alternative to court proceedings and the Minister should allow abuse victims from day schools to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The State has stated that it was not <i>in loco parentis </i>because the children concerned lived at home. Its rationale is that children involved in residential cases were in the care of the State rather than that of their parents. Deputy Healy made a valid point that if a child made an allegation of sexual misconduct against a teacher, he or she would often not be believed and would likely be punished at home or by teachers for making such an allegation. Parents were responsible for their children, but we should bear in mind the dominance of the Department and the whole educational establishment at the time. The abuse that took place was a criminal offence and the victims should be paid compensation. The abuser was employed with public funds and abused a position of trust to perpetrate criminal acts. The State failed in its duty to protect the victimised children. We must examine the issue carefully and ensure victims are compensated and <Col N="311" /> that the State goes out of its way to provide redress.</P>
    <P>We must also be careful to ensure no person is convicted in the wrong and that innocent people, against whom allegations are made, are given the opportunity to protect their good name. There was a miscarriage of justice in the case of Nora Wall. I remember the headlines in the newspapers vilifying her. She was later found to be innocent. Some of the other accused are also innocent. We should also remember that many of those who were in religious orders were trapped. I remember a boy of my own age who went away to be a religious brother at 13 years of age. He never came back for summer or Christmas holidays and his letters home were censored. The only time I saw him again was the day of his mother's funeral when he came to his home accompanied by two brothers. They had dinner in the house and then returned to the institution. He, too, was trapped. We must have compassion for all sides and should also try to have some sympathy and understanding for some of the people who committed such vicious crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of the House, I would like to make a statement on Afghanistan. We meet today as events in Afghanistan are unfolding by the hour. The international community is presented with an enormous challenge. With military success comes great political and humanitarian responsibility. There have been too many atrocities in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, too much bloodshed and too little respect for human life and dignity. The international community needs to act decisively to ensure a new beginning for the people of Afghanistan which will ensure political stability, economic prosperity and the vindication of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the long-suffering people of Afghanistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will know that I have just returned from New York. At the UN, I attended special meetings of the Security Council on Afghanistan and on terrorism. Against the background of the rapidly evolving situation, the Security Council last night adopted a new resolution on Afghanistan. This affirms the central role of the UN and expresses support for the process initiated by Ambassador Brahimi, the UN special representative to Afghanistan. It also supports the efforts to form a transitional administration leading to the formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and <Col N="312" /> fully representative Government. It stresses the need for emergency humanitarian assistance and for long-term reconstruction and rehabilitation. All parties are called on to refrain from acts of reprisal, and to adhere to international law and human rights obligations.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, I represented Ireland at the ministerial meeting on Afghanistan. I emphasised our hope that the military campaign against the Al Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban regime that shelters it will achieve its objectives in as short a timeframe as possible and that every effort will continue to be made to spare civilian casualties. That meeting was attended by the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, Ambassador Brahimi, myself and other Ministers. The Secretary General called for all necessary action to meet the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people and for urgent action so as to avoid a security and political vacuum. He also expressed the view that with full support from all the Afghan parties, the neighbouring countries and the international community, there was now a real opportunity to create the sort of broad-based, fully representative Government which the UN has long been trying to help the Afghan people achieve.</P>
    <P>Ambassador Brahimi, who returned recently from the region, briefed us on his efforts and addressed the next steps. On his contacts with Afghan representatives and the Governments of Pakistan and Iran, he reported that all condemned the use of Afghan territory to support terrorism. He highlighted the need for co-operation between the neighbouring states. He stressed that the international community would have to make a massive commitment, politically and financially, to the long-term stability of Afghanistan. Meetings will now follow to widen the circle of countries. The UN deputy special representative for Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, is on his way to Kabul. Ambassador Brahimi outlined the next steps in the process, political, security and humanitarian. I will set these out in detail as the balance of elements underline the international commitment towards a fully representative Afghan administration.</P>
    <P>On the political transition, the solution must come from the Afghans themselves. Discussions between the various Afghan groups will be brought together quickly under the UN to decide upon the means to establish a transitional administration. This could include: a meeting convened by the UN to agree a framework &ndash; efforts are currently under way to bring together the Afghan parties, excluding the Taliban, at a venue outside the country; concrete steps to convene a fully representative and multi-ethnic provisional council chaired by an individual, who is accepted as a focus for national unity, and several deputy chairmen; within two years the provisional council would propose the composition of a transitional administration and a programme of action, including security arrangements; an emergency traditional assembly &ndash; Loya Jirgha &ndash; to approve the transitional administration, the programme of <Col N="313" /> action and security proposals and to authorise the preparation of a constitution &ndash; this would be followed by a fully-fledged Loya Jirgha at the end of the transitional phase to approve the constitution and create a Government.</P>
    <P>Other elements which are to be elaborated on include the establishment of an international security presence pending an all-Afghan force. The UN is directing a detailed and co-ordinated humanitarian exercise to enable the delivery and distribution of aid. It is expected that Ambassador Brahimi will call together a meeting of Afghan groups in the near future.</P>
    <P>At the meeting, I underlined our ongoing commitment to the efforts of the Secretary General and Ambassador Brahimi to achieve an equitable and balanced solution to the crisis. I stated that a strong message should go out that all parties must respect international law and human rights. I conveyed the support of the Irish Government for Ambassador Brahimi's plan and that we would seek an adequate mandate for his efforts. The UN would have to co-ordinate efforts to secure a broad-based Government with full participation of all ethnic groups. We would examine carefully the various options for security arrangements and the recommendations of the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>I emphasised that a visible and effective humanitarian strategy was necessary, as was prompt donor disbursements. I paid particular tribute to the bravery of the UN and NGOs and condemned the Taliban's harassment of humanitarian officers. Human rights abuses, especially of women and girls, have to be reversed and the new administration held to international standards. I committed us to continue to provide all possible support, nationally at the UN and with our EU partners.</P>
    <P>On the security situation, the UN and the international community will have a role to play in ensuring a stable future for Afghanistan. Ambassador Brahimi made it clear that his preferred option was for an all-Afghan force, supported in the interim by a multinational element. I understand that a number of UN member states have been asked to send troops to Afghanistan to assist in such an operation. It is too early at this stage to anticipate how exactly the UN's role in Afghanistan will develop. If Ireland was to be asked in the future to participate in a peacekeeping or observer mission in Afghanistan, mandated by the UN, such a request would of course be given careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan remains of major and immediate concern to the Government. Our concern is shared throughout the international community where every effort is being made to meet the humanitarian needs of the vulnerable Afghan population. So far this year, £4 million has been provided in bilateral emergency assistance to that country by Ireland. Our priority is to take effective humanitarian action which will have an immediate impact before the winter season fully takes hold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> In his meeting with President Bush last Thursday, the Taoiseach highlighted the humanitarian dimension of this crisis. I have been pursuing these aspects also, notably in my meetings with other Foreign Ministers and senior UN representatives at the current session of the UN General Assembly in New York. In these latest contacts, I have emphasised that there must be a visible and effective strategy for meeting the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the coming period. This will provide a basis upon which the move from providing international emergency relief to supporting national reconstruction can take place. This will be an ongoing process, not a once-off project. As the initial step in this process, we cannot afford to waver in our delivery of humanitarian assistance. It will be an important building-block in creating the conditions for a new national dispensation for the people of Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>The latest developments in Afghanistan are opening up new areas of the country to outside access. This in turn is allowing the delivery of humanitarian assistance to a much greater number of those who are immediately at risk. They now face the hardships of a bleak winter having struggled to survive a summer of drought in the midst of ongoing conflict. The world food programme is making important strides forward in the rate of delivery of aid. Since the beginning of October it has delivered 49,000 metric tonnes of food. This includes more than 23,000 tonnes delivered since the start of November. Regionally, it has 71,000 tonnes in food stocks which can help to support more than eight million people. Of an estimated 250,000 people in Mazar-i-Sharif, 120,000 have been provided with one-month food rations by the WFP with the International Committee of the Red Cross and Crescent working to deliver similar relief packages to the remaining vulnerable population in the city.</P>
    <P>The UN agencies, with the International Red Crescent and the NGO community, are developing a 30-day plan to address urgent humanitarian needs by region. New distribution networks are being put in place. Nearly one third of essential medical supplies have been shipped into Afghanistan. Food convoys are also under way to Herat and Kabul and it is planned to regularise them as the situation improves. Humanitarian needs and security conditions are being monitored by the hour and it is anticipated that more international aid staff will now be able to return and resume their work in assisting the aid effort. Locally employed Afghan staff have continued to work courageously in extremely dangerous conditions to sustain the delivery of aid during the withdrawal of foreign aid workers. I take this opportunity to commend their action and commitment to others in such adversity.</P>
    <P>Recent improvements in aid delivery have resulted from concerted international action. Ireland has been strongly supportive of a number of special missions which were carried out to countries on Afghanistan's borders and which <Col N="315" /> arose from the consultation process which we spearheaded during our Presidency of the UN Security Council. Visits were paid to the region by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers; the UN Secretary General's Special Representative to Afghanistan, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi and by UN Under Secretary General, Kenzo Oshima, who is responsible for the co-ordination of humanitarian aid within Afghanistan. These special missions have led to improved aid delivery and humanitarian access to Afghanistan through neighbouring countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgystan. Along with our bilateral efforts on behalf of Irish NGOs, they have also led to an easing of the visa restrictions which had been inhibiting the work of international aid staff.</P>
    <P>An estimated 52,000 tonnes of food aid are needed each month to meet the requirements of the vulnerable people of Afghanistan. We commend the untiring efforts of the UN agencies, the International Red Crescent and Irish and international NGOs to overcome the obstacles they face to the delivery of this aid in the field. We must give them the strong support they need, at all levels, in this major humanitarian endeavour at the outset of this century. Above all, we must consolidate each step taken so that what we do now will have a lasting, positive effect and be of lasting benefit to the Afghan people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we also face major challenges at this time. Incidents of looting and human rights violations, including extra judicial killings, are being reported daily. I categorically condemn these actions. Not only are they undermining the current humanitarian effort but they are creating a dangerous legacy of ethnic violence and hatred which has the potential to imprison Afghanistan in its past at the expense of its future. The Government calls on all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan to fully observe and uphold the principles and requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law. The looting of aid stocks and seizure of aid vehicles and equipment are utterly unacceptable and must stop. This is essential so that we can continue to provide humanitarian aid regardless of race, age, sex, ethnicity or political affiliation.</P>
    <P>In recent days, we have seen some refugees in Iran return to Afghanistan in response to the new situation. Latterly, the number of refugees choosing to exercise this option has risen to an average of 800 per day. Should the situation in western Afghanistan stabilise further, the UN High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, anticipates that there will be an increase in this trend. The High Commission is also exploring how it may assist those refugees who might similarly wish to return from Pakistan in light of latest developments.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, in a camp in south-western Afghanistan, 6,000 Afghan civilians find themselves trapped in an impasse between armed Taliban who have infiltrated the camp and the Northern Alliance forces which surround them. UNHCR is <Col N="316" /> working flat out to resolve this volatile situation and is examining possible options, such as the moving of the refugees concerned across the border into Iran. It has also been reported that several thousand Afghan refugees have fled into north-west Pakistan and the UNHCR is endeavouring to assess and provide for their immediate needs.</P>
    <P>These developments illustrate the state of flux which continues to challenge the international community in protecting those at risk, determining their precise needs and making the appropriate responses. There is no room for complacency in relation to the refugee situation. It clearly has the potential to worsen, particularly as the military fronts converge in the south of Afghanistan. I call once again, therefore, on neighbouring countries to reopen their borders so as to allow the relevant agencies to deal effectively with the refugee situation. In any event, the reopening of borders continues to be necessary to protect existing refugees and to prevent their exploitation for military or other advantage. The provision of humanitarian assistance must receive top priority from the international community. In setting out to create a new future for Afghanistan, we must help to alleviate the suffering of its people and help them to overcome the legacy of conflict, repression and drought which they have been carrying for decades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing this debate. I also thank the Minister for his attendance and for providing a comprehensive description and understanding of what is happening on the ground. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak first on behalf of my party on what has been a tragic and difficult two month period since the atrocities of 11 September. I will begin by setting the scene as to why things have happened and will then proceed with a brief description of a visit I made to Pakistan and the Afghan border region and some of the people I met there. I will conclude by outlining what we as a country should do in this so-called war on terrorism that is a global challenge and will continue long after the military campaign finishes in Afghanistan, I hope sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>On 11 September an act of war &ndash; I do not use the term lightly &ndash; and extreme terrorism was committed on the USA. The world was shocked as the centre of commercial life in the western world and the symbol of prosperity that has made America the super power it is, was attacked with a massive loss of innocent life. Six thousand people from over 70 different countries died a terrifying death. As the investigation was put together it became clear that the overwhelming evidence pointed to the involvement of Osama bin Laden as the person responsible for the atrocity, as he had been previously responsible for atrocities at the US embassy in Kenya and earlier bombings at the World Trade Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US immediately took the lead in aggressively putting together a worldwide alliance <Col N="317" /> against terrorism. On 7 October the inevitable US-led military campaign in Afghanistan began, supported under the UN Charter and based on the right of any nation to use reasonable means to defend itself having been attacked. As I understand it, the objectives were outlined at the time. The first is to destroy the Al-Qaeda network of terrorist training camps within Afghanistan. Others were to find and, if possible, capture Osama bin Laden and to remove the extremist Taliban regime, which for some time has supported and harboured terrorist activity under the name of Al-Qaeda.</P>
    <P>The result in Afghanistan was a war on three fronts, the military campaign, the humanitarian campaign and the political and diplomatic challenges we face. Ireland has joined the global alliance on terrorism and is an ally of the US in its efforts. As the country's representatives in this House we must ask what we can and should do to actively assist in the war on terrorism and, perhaps most importantly, to ensure that the tactics adopted are fair and humane, even in the extreme circumstances that exist.</P>
    <P>During the week the Dáil was in recess I spent five days in Pakistan. I considered it important that in view of the fact that the country had joined the global alliance on terrorism, we should be as informed as possible, both on the Opposition and Government benches, on what is happening there. In that five days I learned more about international politics than I had the rest of my life. I also learnt about the massive humanitarian challenge we face in that part of the world.</P>
    <P>I flew from Islamabad to Quetta, a city near the southern border of Afghanistan. We travelled with a Concern aid agency under military escort across the Kojak mountains to a town called Chaman, with which the Minister will be familiar. It is right on the border with Afghanistan and is a place where the majority of refugees who have fled from Kandahar have been crossing, despite the fact the Pakistan border is officially closed to all but refugees who are severely ill or injured. Many refugees are streaming across to a staging camp which has been set up by a Cork man working for UNHCR. I interviewed many of those refugees and asked why they were fleeing, whether it was the fear of being bombed, because they needed to find food, or because of the Taliban regime. At the time to a man &ndash; I was not allowed speak to the women &ndash; they said they were fleeing because of fear of the bombing.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that when the bombing began in Afghanistan on 7 October the majority of Afghans probably celebrated, and I have facts to back up that statement. They felt this was the beginning of the end of a very unpopular regime. The Taliban has less than 10% political support which lies in only one community of many. There were celebrations in many parts of the country, but as the bombing continued and as the number of innocent civilian casualties mounted, that feeling changed quite dramatically. What was most worrying politically was the intense hatred among <Col N="318" /> so many people crossing the border for the west and in particular for the US because they knew people who had been killed and because they had been driven from their homes. That is the tragedy of warfare and it has to be accepted by realists.</P>
    <P>I spoke to politicians in Pakistan, including Imran Khan, a former cricket player, and Illahi bus Soomro, a former Speaker of the House in Pakistan. They had slightly differing views but both agreed that Pakistan was in danger of becoming quite unstable politically if the military campaign continued at length. They will be very relieved that an end to the military campaign is perhaps in sight.</P>
    <P>It is important to say the amount of work being done in Afghanistan by Irish aid agencies and people to relieve the suffering of innocent people is phenomenal. Aid agencies such as Concern, GOAL and Trócaire, and people such as the man I already referred to who works for UNHCR and set up a refugee camp, Nora Hyland, a UN adviser on humanitarian issues &ndash; the list of Irish people there is very long &ndash; are doing our country proud and are contributing to dealing with the consequences of the war on terrorism.</P>
    <P>I went from Pakistan to New York as I felt it was important to get balance on the issue. I spoke to some politicians there and our Ambassador to the UN, Richard Ryan. I visited ground zero, an experience which hit me like a tonne of bricks. Any doubt I had that what happened on 11 September was not an act of war was put to bed. There are 16 acres of desolation in the centre of downtown Manhattan, the financial centre of the world, and it is still smoking and smouldering. Dust still gets caught in one's throat, nose and eyes, and I will not forget it for some time. I was really struck by the relatives of people who died, whom I met and who are still there praying and keeping updated photographs of their loved ones on walls.</P>
    <P>At this stage we must look at Ireland's specific role in the war on terrorism which has rapidly moved through its first stage. We should not waste our time and effort in being overly critical of the US military campaign. We have far more credibility in other areas and aspects of the war on which we should concentrate. I congratulate the Minister who has done a very good job for Ireland during our chairmanship of the Security Council, who continues to do a good job and is extremely informed on what is happening. As a result we are focusing on the areas where we have credibility. We are constantly highlighting humanitarian issues in the UN and we are being listened to. It is perhaps fair to say the humanitarian effort would have been far less significant had it not been for the role Ireland played on the Security Council during October. The consultation process which took place in the Security Council would not have been as comprehensive if Ireland had not shown leadership in how it chaired the Security Council. I congratulate Richard Ryan in particular, and the Minister. We must also play a role in finding political answers to <Col N="319" /> what is a very complex situation in Afghanistan which is constantly developing and changing. I will read an e-mail I received from a friend I made in UNHCR, who had spent much time working in Afghanistan preceding the bombing. Two weeks ago he outlined for me a road map for settlement. He said:</P>
    <P>Legitimacy is the key to the transition. The former King and the UN both command legitimacy and their leading role will massively strengthen any political process. The Security Council is under an obligation to restore international security which has clearly been breached, and the US will continue to exercise self-defence until the Security Council fulfils its obligation. The basic formula is well known. The Security Council should mandate the Secretary General to convene an Afghan transitional Government [I am glad that while that exact process is not happening, something very similar is taking place]. The Secretary General should request the King to preside over the transitional Government, including its compact leadership council, with the appropriate ethnic mix [Something very similar to that is also happening, which I welcome]. Finally, when it is able to establish itself in Afghanistan the transitional Government can proceed with establishing a national army, co-ordinating the reconstruction programme and drafting a new constitution. It will then hold a <i>Loya Jirgha</i> to adopt the constitution, followed by free and open elections.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased and relieved to see that what people have spent a large portion of their lives trying to do in Afghanistan and what they are promoting as the right solutions seem to be coming about far sooner then I expected. The international community was incredibly taken aback by how quickly things have changed militarily in Afghanistan, and it has been caught somewhat unawares by this from a political perspective. As we have been caught unawares we need to respond quickly, which requires leadership from the UN.</P>
    <P>I welcome the UN motion which was adopted last night. In the meantime, while transitional talks take place, it is essential that we use our influence to insist that an international peacekeeping force, primarily representative of Muslim countries, goes into Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and other towns such as Herat which need stability during this key period while there is a political vacuum. The Northern Alliance asked for UN assistance and we should provide it immediately while the political process is being put in place. I appeal to the Minister to continue to use his influence to drive the humanitarian and political agendas where Ireland has credibility. We should not waste time being critical of a military campaign which is trying to achieve objectives and a success that can be sold to the American people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Afghanistan and its future. I believe there is a consensus in this House and internationally that the delivery of aid in the most efficient and humane manner possible is probably the greatest task facing us. I would like to use the time available to me to review a number of matters. The Minister will be aware that the difference between us is in the interpretation of one resolution, even though there are other matters on which we agree.</P>
      <P>I will use my time to introduce headings. What should we learn from the appalling events that have taken place? I have on many occasions condemned the appalling atrocity where 6,000 people lost their lives within one hour and which left 100,000 children without parents. I have been unconditional and unequivocal in my condemnation of that atrocity. The Irish public and I learned something from what took place following the response to these atrocities in New York. One was the way in which the international media covers acts of war but does not cover acts of human suffering. There are just under 21.5 million people in Afghanistan. There are two million refugees in Pakistan, two million in Iran, perhaps 2.5 million people internally displaced, plus several thousand in Tajikistan. Prior to the events of 11 September, an incredible human disaster was unfolding in Afghanistan, which precedes the Taliban. I welcome the end of a regime which brutalised women in particular, was intolerant and represented the very worst possible distortion of Islam. After the long war against the occupation of the Soviet Union and the later civil wars appalling human rights atrocities took place in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether we will ever see Sky television covering circumstances where 10% of children under five years of age suffer from acute malnutrition, 24% of children under five die from measles and another 22%, one child in five, die from diarrhoea. The two latter diseases are preventable. I will not go into the matter now because I do not have time but in the middle of the 1990s the world spent $12 billion on preventable diseases such as those I mentioned and $846 billion on armaments. Sky television and other sections of the media have an obsession with the coverage of war and a singular ignorant incapacity to deal with the regular structural sources of death affecting children and populations who are malnourished. That matter is for another day but it raises the question, following the recent events, of whether interest will wane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now is the time for people whose morality is challenged by these events to continue the difficult exercises in diplomacy to put together a post-Taliban situation and, even more urgently, to continue to be conscious of the degree of aid required. Approximately 40% of the aid pledged has arrived. The figure of 52,000 tonnes has been <Col N="321" /> upgraded to approximately 70,000, which will probably be needed. However, these figures will change as some refugees return home and people begin to assess the numbers of displaced people within the country.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong to suggest that the events that have taken place amount to a victory for bombing over diplomacy. It remains my conviction that the strengthening of the United Nations is still one of the major aims of foreign policy, and must be so. Deputy Coveney referred to the legitimacy that might be sourced in the former King Shah and in the United Nations. While the United Nations has suffered from previous experiences, it has often suffered also from being weakened. I agree that Resolution 1333 of November 2000 which called on the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden was ignored and neglected. I agree with Resolution 1373 which calls for a campaign against terrorism to be internationally supported. It has my support given the threat of international terrorism. I have a question in regard to Resolution 1368 because I believe Article 51 of chapter VII of the United Nations Charter is invoked <i>ex post facto</i> rather than anything else. Article 51 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely urgent to put the Security Council at the centre of things. I believe the role for Ireland in the Security Council, in particular in terms of its influence in the General Assembly, enjoying support such as 130 votes out of a membership of 189, is to revitalise the role of the United Nations at this stage.</P>
    <P>It would be very appropriate for Ireland to convene an international conference to face the issue of debating Islam and the west. There are few more dangerous notions than those reflected in Professor Huntingdon's articles of approximately 1996 on the clash of civilisations. This is a dangerous nonsense. It assumes that one is able to profile easily what constitutes the west. When I say it is rather ignorantly informed, the west itself draws much of its inspiration from the Mesopotamian Valley and from different sources, including Judaic and Christian cultures and which, in turn, are influenced by other thousands of years old cultures. Equally, militant fundamentalist <Col N="322" /> Islam, and the different factions of it, is a quite recent creation, and Islam goes further back. The west has been very slow to acknowledge the existence of other world civilisations and to abandon notions of the supremacy of one over the other. There is an urgent need now to try to understand the reasons that behind this is a deep distrust among Muslim communities of the culture of Islam. It is little less than tragic that there are those who propagate a view that is an encouragement of hate when the very tenets of the text of the faith which they profess are ones of co-existence. Ireland would earn huge credibility by taking an initiative in this regard. It has to be taken by a country perceived as being able to lift itself out of the theory of interest.</P>
    <P>My fourth point relates to the theory of interest. International policy conducted on the basis of friends and enemies, friends of today and former enemies of yesterday, is not only short-term, but incapable of generating a long-term foreign policy. If one is exercising sanctions against a body in one year and, less than one year later, regarding it as a most essential friend, even as a matter of expediency in response to an act of terror, that is not a stable basis for a relationship within international policy. Foreign policy has to be informed by the prosecution of aims that transcend particular relationships, even ones structured around interest.</P>
    <P>We are now entering on an incredible task. There is an opportunity, within the next two weeks before the heavy snows come, to flood Afghanistan with relief aid. In addition, we must commit ourselves to the technical reconstruction of the country, in terms of water and sanitation. The diseases to which I referred, causing tragic loss of life of children under five years, are preventable, such as those related to measles and diarrhoea. It is important to address the issues thrown up by this conflict &ndash; the obscenity of the recruitment of child soldiers, the recruitment into factions, on all sides, of young people under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>We are all edified by the role of our NGOs, such as Concern, Trocaire, GOAL and the international agencies to which we make contributions, including the Red Cross and UNICEF, which produces the very best figures and profiles of the need in Afghanistan. It would be even more edifying if there could be as much interest internationally, in a media sense, in the work of these organisations as in preparing for war.</P>
    <P>We are at a crossroads. It must be recognised now that it is not the bombing which will have brought a result. What is important is to restore the relationship between diplomacy and military action. Those countries with the greatest military capacity do not have the right to supplant diplomacy. It is only by operating under the aegis of international law, in multilateral institutions to which people sign up as equals in the charter, that <Col N="323" /> we can have a world that will give us a humane kind of governance. In making that point, one is not anti anybody, but simply stating that it is the role of small countries to vindicate international law. We must insist that, when actions take place, the public has a right to hear and see &ndash; there must not be censorship on actions. We have seen too little of the civilian dimensions of what is taking place in Afghanistan. We need to see the civilian dimensions of the aid need and have it covered accurately. In saying this, I make no criticism of the Minister &ndash; this matter is not his function &ndash; but I suspect he agrees with much of what I have said in relation to the coverage of the civilian side of the situation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's comments as to how outrageous and unacceptable it is that there are arbitrary executions and that people are tried without due process. Perhaps it is too much to hope there would not be instincts for retribution and revenge, but they have to be addressed. Some of those who now temporarily hold power, ahead of any transitional arrangements, have themselves been indicted for human rights crimes. This is a horrific situation and there is no easy solution. The approach during the coming weeks and months must be through the support of the United Nations and on a regional and structured basis.</P>
    <P>Pakistan has certainly not come out of this in exactly the same state as before the conflict began. It is changed utterly. There have been most extensive demonstrations within it. Its head of Government is non-elected. There is a whole series of redefinitions of what should happen on the border. There is a case for the opening of the borders, to which the Minister referred. This is essential to enable genuine refugees to flee to camps where they can be appropriately and safely provided for. Pakistan needs to be assured of wherewithal to run and sustain these camps. That support needs to be delivered now.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be continuing public interest in the tasks of reconstruction and the avoidance of death through malnutrition. I suggest there should be another opportunity to review, in greater depth than time allows today, the overall circumstance in which Resolution 1368 came to be accepted and prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I was greatly impressed by the Minister's analysis and critique in his statement, which was in keeping with the keen interest he has taken in the evolving situation in Afghanistan. I also compliment Deputy Coveney on his contribution to the debate and his media interviews which I heard on RTE and elsewhere. A cross-party approach is important in this evolving situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> The Minister said that, with military success, there also comes great political and humanitarian responsibility. Ireland has made its contribution through the UN Security Council. In view of the strong support with which Ireland was elected to the presidency of the Security Council, we have a moral authority which we should not underestimate. In our presidency in October the Minister exercised that moral authority in a manner which enhanced Ireland's contribution at that level.</P>
    <P>The evolving situation has two aspects. On the military aspect, I agree with those who said it is not a matter of bombing Afghanistan into the ground. The strategy should be measured and deliberate. That point of view is now coming to the fore. We must also focus on the humanitarian aspect, which Ireland has promoted from the very outset. The Afghan people need a new beginning, with the right support. Ambassador Richard Ryan has been very anxious to emphasise the need to develop a post-Taliban regime in Afghanistan while recognising that this will not be an easy task. The advent of the winter snows very shortly will bring complicating factors, both militarily and in relation to humanitarian interventions. I welcome the news this morning of the safe return to Islamabad of the humanitarian aid workers and take this opportunity to compliment the various NGOs, other agencies and aid workers for the work they are doing and continue to do in Afghanistan. The challenge for them will be great and the distribution of food programme is vital.</P>
    <P>I note the overnight news that the Security Council has endorsed a resolution on proposals for a broad based post-Taliban Afghan government. That is a positive step towards a transitional government. With the various tribes and warlords who have been fighting in Afghanistan for many years it will pose an enormous challenge to the international community. However this is a challenge we must take up and now is the time for the UN to assert its moral authority and I am impressed that the Security Council is taking a lead role in the post-Taliban developments. Clearly Ambassador Brahimi and Kofi Annan along with the members of the Security Council are acutely aware of the opportunities that now exist.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that that area, including Pakistan, may be destabilised further and this will particularly affect the Pashtun tribe which has been partitioned over generations. With the Taliban being forced into a corner there is a danger that those tribes may in turn cause destabilisation in Pakistan. We must recognise the risks the Pakistani government took in supporting the alliance against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact that bin Laden and Mullah Mohammed Omar are still at large. Whether they are captured or killed is somewhat irrelevant, but they need to be brought to justice. <Col N="325" /> There is a danger that we may create martyrs and we need to avoid that.</P>
    <P>The need for humanitarian aid is critical and the programme to distribute food is continuing. However after a summer of drought and years of destitution and cruelty under a variety of regimes, we now need to ensure the Afghan people have at least the basics of human living. They need to have shelter, food and a decent level of health support, otherwise there will be a very disillusioned and angry people in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>The need to bring together the disparate groups in Afghanistan is laudable. However it will not happen quickly. The Minister knows the challenges that face the Security Council and Ambassador Brahimi in trying to broker a new regime. It is easy to concentrate on the present crisis but we tend to forget that Afghanistan has been a melting pot of war and ethnic cleansing for generations. We should not think that a new government can be put in place easily.</P>
    <P>The Muslim community has a distinct culture and we need to be careful about trying to impose models of governance on Afghanistan which might replicate what we would regard as stable government. In the past some governments, which have been erroneously imposed sometimes on subservient peoples, have unravelled very shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>Whether the United Nations sends a peacekeeping contingent there is something which ought to be decided. The Minister has said that if Ireland were called upon to make a peacekeeping contribution, that would be looked at. Whatever UN peacekeeping groups go in, they will need to have a cultural understanding of the region. That may influence our contribution.</P>
    <P>Humanitarian assistance is critical. Like others, I pay tribute to organisations like Trócaire, UNICEF, GOAL, the Red Cross and the many aid workers already there. It is extremely important to reopen borders as adverted to by Deputy Michael Higgins. If the flood of refugees either out of or into Afghanistan is impeded by political decisions by governments on whatever side of Afghanistan, then there is a danger of precipitating a very great humanitarian crisis. That needs to be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>We all condemn unreservedly reports that there have been atrocities against innocent people in Afghanistan of whatever tribe or ethnic background. There are no excuses for that kind of attempt at exerting authority or inflicting particular viewpoints on innocent people. It was heartening to see there is some move in the direction of a more liberal regime even by what must be loosely called an interim post-Taliban government.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there will be a difficult time ahead. The Minister and his colleagues on the Security Council know the magnitude of the chal<Col N="326" /> lenge. I thank him for coming here and for the work they continue to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this crucial debate. As members of any democratic parliament, we should continue to be involved in what now happens in Afghanistan. Ireland has a fine record of involvement at a humanitarian and political level in many of the horrendous atrocities and areas of conflict throughout the world. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Coveney, that Ireland must offer to do what it is best at doing. We should not involve ourselves in areas in which we do not have expertise. We are not a military nation. We are a neutral nation. We have no experience of participation in war.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his staff at the UN for what they have done. There has been a steady hand at UN level and that should continue. The Minister has been committed to recognising the humanitarian aspects of this conflict that are now foremost in our minds.</P>
      <P>I also pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Coveney, who was the only Member of this House to go out there. He has prepared many fine reports for the media, giving us a first hand account of what it was like to see the refugees flooding into Pakistan. Despite the fact that the borders were closed, people were doing anything they could to get out of Afghanistan. Now the reverse is happening and the Deputy has done us all proud by being there to give us a first-hand, eye witness account. I know how much I gained from being in Rwanda after the atrocities there and seeing the suffering. Deputy Coveney, I know from speaking to him, is personally changed by what he witnessed, and I thank him for sharing his views with us.</P>
      <P>I remind the House what our ambassador, Richard Ryan, said at the Security Council meeting on 12 September in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of 11 September:</P>
      <P>Respect for the human rights of each and every person, for the right of every nation and every human being to live in freedom and dignity. These are the fundamental principles of the United Nations. It is these values that the perpetrators of yesterday's crimes seek to destroy. In our sorrow and loss, it is also right today to clearly assert that from evil can only come evil, that no cause can ever succeed that is based on mass murder and carnage, that those who perpetrate such deeds are the enemies of all people everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These words echoed our own feelings after the atrocities perpetrated on the people of the United States on 11 September. We must also remember the rights spoken of by Richard Ryan at this difficult time when the Northern Alliance has taken over Kabul and the United Nations has publicly <Col N="327" /> called for serious consideration of who will now govern Afghanistan. I welcome the fact that the United Nations passed a motion calling for a meeting in the United Arab Emirates to discuss Afghanistan's future.</P>
    <P>The people, who were for the time being the friends of those who wanted to attack the perpetrators of 11 September, have themselves, as Mary Robinson said, a bad human rights record. I hope that this is a turning point in how the United States views its role in international affairs. They will have to consider more who are their friends and what help they give to whom at times when it seems appropriate to their interests. We must remember that once Osama bin Laden and his cohorts were considered the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo;, to use such parlance, whom America wanted to assist.</P>
    <P>I hope that the United Nations will intervene in Afghanistan to create the necessary &ndash; and I hate this expression &ndash; window of opportunity for those who respect the human rights and dignity of their own people to govern Afghanistan. Resolutions 1368 and 1373 remind us, by mentioning other conventions and regulations which the UN expects member countries to implement, of the lassitude of its members which have acted only when forced to take action against the financing of terrorism and the countries that support it. The UN has many fine and aspirational conventions and regulations which we are slow to put into force. Hence, Resolution 1368 refers to Resolution 1269 of 19 October 1999 which has not been implemented.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian crisis which existed in Afghanistan for years before 11 September, and will continue to exist despite the actions of the American and British forces, is only receiving attention now because of recent events. We should learn from this that something, which is in the news and we want to discuss, should not be forgotten when the heat dies down. The Minister stated that 52,000 tonnes of food is required each month in Afghanistan which represents a monumental logistics problem. I hope that in the coming weeks we will see more safe corridors being created in addition to the opening of the Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan borders. The food must go to the people who need it and if the refugees in Pakistan return home, the food and aid must follow them. I support what Deputy Michael Higgins said about supporting the neighbouring countries that find themselves, willingly or otherwise, playing host to thousands of people.</P>
    <P>It happened to the countries bordering Rwanda and Burundi. Tanzanians who visited me recently informed me that there are still border refugee camps in remote areas of Tanzania where the Government has not the resources to assist them. We know, as a wealthy country, the extra resources that Departments have to find to give succour to refugees, such as those from the Bal<Col N="328" /> kan war. It is much more difficult for these countries receiving refugees.</P>
    <P>Many of those in the camps want to go home. I know from my own sources that the work of Irish agencies, Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Christian Aid, and others is important. Whatever it takes to loosen the purse strings and regulations in this emergency must be done. I pay tribute to those agency workers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister already heard at the Committee on Foreign Affairs, combining aid drops with bombing should never happen again because it fudges the lines between a humanitarian and a military exercise and gives a wrong impression. I recognise it was an emergency but we do not know if the food reached the people who most needed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended a meeting in Limerick last week with Senator Jackman at which I was asked what would happen next. I predicted that the Northern Alliance would take Mazar-i-Sharif and then rapidly go on to Kabul, but I was not able to predict what would happen after that. I said that a situation could emerge which would make Beirut look like a picnic. We will have an unstable situation on our hands. Our so-called friends the Northern Alliance, whom the allies assisted, are a disreputable bunch of cut-throats who have replaced another bunch of cut-throats. The statistics on the Northern Alliance do not make pleasant reading. In 1996, when they left Kabul, they left behind 50,000 dead. They were responsible for 80% of the drugs trade. Stopping the movement of heroin was one of the reasons given by Tony Blair for going into Afghanistan. For all the atrocities that the Taliban committed, it was not responsible for the drugs trade. These were the people who were told not to enter Kabul, but that was a vain hope and they went in. Now we hear they are rejecting the offer of UN troops. Matters are very unstable, particularly in Pakistan where a very dim view of the Northern Alliance has always been taken.</P>
      <P>This is going to be very difficult to sort out in the short-term. We have been told that US and UK troops will be sent in. I am not quite sure if this will be done under a UN mandate or by way of resolution. What role, if any, is Ireland going to play? Are our troops going to be sent to this unstable area? I have grave reservations about that prospect at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now seems that I cannot be given information in response to parliamentary questions on grounds of national security. That is regrettable. What does the Minister mean by this? Does it mean that if the information is given to me that Ireland will suddenly become a target? Why would we be a target? Clearly, it is because we are now part of the American war effort. We have gone beyond what we should have done. Giving our airports and airspace has compro<Col N="329" /> mised Irish neutrality to such an extent that it can be forgotten about &ndash; at least as far as the Government is concerned.</P>
    <P>I listened to Tony Blair speak while on his recent tour of the region. I was somewhat encouraged when he talked about looking at the root causes. Likewise, we heard noises from the United States recognising, for the first time, that there may now have to be a Palestinian state. That is all very encouraging. I hope this will not be forgotten in the euphoria of this partial victory and that the root causes will be addressed.</P>
    <P>We seem to have forgotten about Mr. Bin Laden. He was the prime target of this exercise, but is still at large with his cohorts. The propaganda issued by Bin Laden referred to Palestine, sanctions in Iraq and the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia. If we forget about these issues and pursue a military rather than multilateral approach, conditions will not improve in the slightest.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bin Laden has secured a propaganda coup and attracted many young people to his cause. One remembers another martyr, Che Guevara, who was murdered in Bolivia as he travelled with a troop of only 14 men. After his death thousands flocked to his cause. Something similar could happen with Bin Laden.</P>
    <P>We should have had a far more proportionate response which could have involved a broad range of interests had we waited a little longer. I fully understand the pressure that the US President was under, people were baying for revenge, but this approach will not yield any great success. We are now seeing geo-political games being played out. The beneficiaries are the Russians, who supply the Northern Alliance, and the United States, which has carried out the bombing.</P>
    <P>We are not in a better situation. Those who suffered under the Taliban will naturally feel this liberation for a period. However, as we have previously seen, the Northern Alliance does not respect human rights either. Perhaps US and UK troops can restore some semblance of order if they go into the country, but this will lead to a new and different set of conditions. We saw British troops hailed as heroes and given cups of tea in the Bogside when they came first, but it turned sour shortly afterwards. Something similar could well happen in Afghanistan and continue for many, many years. I hope it will not turn out like that.</P>
    <P>I hope the United Nations will bring sanity to this, but that is not a great hope. I am extremely disappointed with its lily-livered approach up to now. There was no UN mandate for this action, there was simply the very broad Resolution 1368. The United Nations needs to restore its authority, not let the United States call the shots.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian issue is of the utmost importance. We must help bordering countries in every possible way. The refugee problem is going to get <Col N="330" /> much worse now that winter is looming. We may have opened some passages in order that food can be moved by land, but enormous difficulties remain. I hope the United Nations will play a major role. All we can do is watch as developments unfold, but I still believe we are witnessing a wrong approach that will not yield positive results in the long-term. I hope the Government, using its seat on the Security Council, can persuade people to change, but looking at how we have capitulated to bigger powers so far, I do not hold out much hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>Like all right-thinking people throughout the world, we unreservedly condemned the atrocities of 11 September in the United States. I had hoped the response would have been led by the United Nations and made use of the International Criminal Court. Even at this late stage I appeal to the Government and the United Nations to ensure the International Criminal Court is brought into being as soon as possible. It is only if matters of justice are dealt with by an independent International Criminal Court that the future will be brighter than what we have seen in the past six weeks.</P>
      <P>The response to the events of 11 September should not see the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world waging war on the poorest. We know there were seven million Afghan refugees before the war started with two million each in Pakistan and Iran, 1.5 million displaced in Afghanistan and the rest spread throughout Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and other countries. Hundreds of thousands of children were dying annually from malnutrition and measles, two minor illnesses which could be treated with little funding from and the goodwill of the international community.</P>
      <P>The Northern Alliance has replaced the Taliban in most of Afghanistan and, unfortunately, one regime with an abysmal human rights record has been exchanged for another. The UN has confirmed that the Northern Alliance, which ruled in Kabul until 1996, perpetrated significant human rights atrocities against the people of Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that we focus on the question of aid and the opening of air and road corridors for the Afghan people. In Afghanistan winter will set in within the next ten days or fortnight and if aid cannot get into the country and distribution stations are not set up quickly, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people will die. I thank the various aid workers who have been working along the Afghan border for Irish aid agencies such as Trócaire, Concern and GOAL. I hope they will be allowed into the country to set up distribution and aid centres over the next week to counter malnutrition and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I would like the UN to become directly involved in building a broad-based democratic Government in the country and I support the call for UN peacekeeping forces to be sent there. I would also like the UN and the international community generally to ensure Afghanistan's infrastructure is rebuilt, particularly in terms of water and sewerage schemes and roads, many of which have been destroyed by the aerial bombardment of the past month or six weeks. The international community has a responsibility in this regard and the rebuilding should commence as soon as possible.</P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The war that is being prosecuted in Afghanistan is allegedly a war for freedom and democracy. That demonstrably is a lie. The US and Britain, in their foreign policies, are not principled supporters of freedom and democracy. The contrary is true in instance after instance. The US is still the main sponsor of Saudi Arabia, which is ruled by a monstrous regime. Democratic rights are non-existent, civil rights are openly flouted, medieval barbarism reigns in terms of punishment for minor transgressions and foreign workers are grotesquely exploited, yet the country is armed and supported in every way by the US.</P>
      <P>Since Mr. Blair came to power five years ago he has honoured the contracts to supply armaments to Indonesia which has a brutal regime that was responsible for vicious massacres of the people of East Timor. The infamous example of Chile in 1973 still has resonance today. A left-wing democratic Government was brought down by the machinations of US intelligence with the backing of the US administration. Recently Mr. Blair has been leading a coalition allegedly for the arrest of alleged terrorist, Osama bin Laden, portraying himself as a monumental hypocrite. He had a proven mass murderer, General Pinochet, in his hands only two years ago and instead of putting him on trial he made sure he returned safely to Chile.</P>
      <P>The question for the US and Britain is not whether one is a mass murderer but on whose behalf one carries out mass murder. If mass murder is carried out on behalf of American and British-based multinational corporations that are making profits and keeping a foothold in pursuit of the foreign policies of these countries, then it is all right. However, if it is carried out for different reasons, it is not all right and a war is launched against the perpetrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Northern Alliance, as has been stated by other speakers, has been responsible for killings and lootings. When an army has surrendered or is on the run it is a crime against humanity to arbitrarily shoot and murder people. The new-found champions of democracy sponsored by the US, the Northern Alliance, is engaged in such <Col N="332" /> activity. The Taliban operated an absolutely monstrous regime but it was up to the people of Afghanistan to get rid of the regime, similar to the removal of Milosevic, which was the responsibility of the Serbian people.</P>
    <P>Terrorism is a reactionary and futile force but it feeds off the crimes of western powers and foreign policy. The oppression of the Palestinians and the monstrous suffering imposed on the Iraqis will continue to feed terrorism because the current campaign is not resolving those issues. It is amazing the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not mention these problems in his contribution. The Government, far from taking an independent line, has displayed pitiful helplessness and total subservience to the US on this issue. It is from the cesspit of poverty, suffering and degradation that is the plight of billions of people in the world that monstrous acts of terror emanate.</P>

      <P>When I spoke here in a debate on 3 October, I said I was opposed, as I believed most people were and are, to a war of retaliation in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September atrocities in the US. Since then we have witnessed such a war. We do not yet know how many innocent civilians have been killed in the bombardment of that impoverished country but it must run into thousands, yet the civilians killed in Afghanistan are regarded as of less account than those killed in the US. We hear little or nothing of their families and the devastation left behind by sudden and violent bereavement. Instead, we have this war portrayed in the media in the most jingoistic manner.</P>
      <P>We have witnessed the obscenity of food and cluster bombs being dropped at the same time. One of the most land-mined countries in the world has had vast stretches of its lands rendered even more deadly with the dropping of millions of cluster bombs and other ordnance which leaves a horrific legacy to Afghan children. Now that the war has reached a decisive phase, we must ask again what are the war aims of the US and Britain and their allies in Afghanistan. Are they to capture or kill Osama bin Laden? Is it to put him on trial? Is it to install the Northern Alliance? Is it to occupy the country as the British Empire, the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union tried and failed to do in the past? We do not know.</P>
      <P>We have not been told and it seems the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs have not asked these critical questions. They certainly did not ask them before they gave a <i>carte blanche</i> for the use of our airports when we did not even know the nature of the proposed attacks. Why has the Government not questioned the very shaky premise on which the war has been based? The premise is that by hunting down Osama bin Laden the allies will be able to quell his network of active supporters both in Afghanistan and throughout the world.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> Anyone who knows anything about the history of conflicts knows that this approach is doomed to failure. They cannot hope to suppress violent fundamentalism by military means. Everything reasonable and consistent with human rights should be done to defend people against it but its origins and the conditions which sustain it are far too complex for a quick fix military solution. It is clear that what is needed now in Afghanistan is the immediate intervention of the United Nations, including peacekeeping forces, to ensure that a truly representative interim government can be established and can function. The downtrodden women of Afghanistan should be given their rightful place in that new dispensation. The brutal civil wars which have wrecked Afghanistan throughout the 1980s and 1990s were fought by those forces originally armed and backed by the Western powers when they were trying to drive out the Soviet Union. Peace in Afghanistan cannot be based on foreign arms of whatever origin. There, as elsewhere, peace can only be based on national self-determination, respect for human rights and democratic government. Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One will appreciate that it is with great difficulty I stand here today while Ireland is into the last 20 minutes of the match. Nevertheless, the job must go on.</P>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, this Government has made unprecedented and substantial capital investment in the education sector. The allocation this year of over £370 million across all levels is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> I am committed to continuing the significant programme of investment in school infrastructure commenced by this Government when it took office. I am determined to maintain the rate of progress made by this Government to date in overcoming the historic deficit in relation to school building and in meeting the needs of today. Over 800 major building projects are currently being progressed. The rate at which any particular project moves forward depends on factors such as the acquisition of a suitable site, the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors. Following the publication of the Estimates of expenditure for 2002 and once all budget decisions have been taken by the Government, I will finalise the detailed capital programme for major school building in 2002. The programme will demonstrate to all concerned the scale and substance of the Government's commitment.</P>
    <P>I already indicated my intention to press ahead with a radically new communications strategy for the building unit of my Department that will allow school authorities and other interested parties, including Members of the Oireachtas, access up to date information on any building project. My Department is examining a web-based approach that will be consistent with e-government and in particular the Government' s commitment to put Ireland at the forefront of e-procurement developments.</P>

      <P>Members of this House are fed up to the back teeth with tabling specific and detailed parliamentary questions about the current state of individual school projects and receiving no specific or detailed information about those projects in reply. I consider it to be an abuse by the Minister of parliamentary privilege.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the staff in the schools building unit in Tullamore are overworked and under-resourced. Notwithstanding the recommendations for reorganisation of the building unit, does the Minister find it acceptable to issue a standard response which contains no detail to all individual detailed questions about school building programmes?</P>

The budget has yet to come and when the whole process is completed we will be very clear on how much extra we can take on. We are doing four times what was done before; there is a huge volume of work under way and that work will continue. There is no question of freezing work as the Deputy suggested outside and he upset many people throughout the country. The funds are now provided. The Estimates show that the money to continue is there. I hope the Deputy will desist from this ridiculous&mdash;</P>

How many have been given the go ahead? What is the cost involved? The standard practice is that the estimated outturn is included in the Estimates.

This position has been reiterated in previous responses to parliamentary questions and in communications with the institute.</P>

      <P>The National Foundation for Educational Research submitted its report to my Department at the end of last month. The foundation was commissioned by my Department in May of this year to carry out a detailed review of all current State-funded models of educational response to the needs of children with autism. The review covered provision currently being made for children with autism in special schools, special classes attached to ordinary schools, integrated settings in ordinary schools and by way of home-based programmes.</P>
      <P>The foundation's report is a detailed and complex document which highlights the range of issues involved in the development of educational support services for children with autism. My Department is currently considering the report in detail.</P>
      <P>I intend that the report will be made publicly available as soon as possible in conjunction with the report of the task force on autism, which has been received in my Department in recent days. With this in mind, my Department is arranging to have copies of both reports printed so that they can be made available to interested parties as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a decision regarding the provision of a school bus service to Seamount Convent secondary school, Kinvara, County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have again had the request for the provision of a school transport service for girls from the Gort catchment area to Seamount secondary school, Kinvara, examined in my Department. Having considered the points put forward by the deputation I met during the summer, the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the catchment boundary system, I have decided that the current arrangements should continue for now. If the management authorities of both schools are agreeable, I would introduce a shared catchment area. This would overcome the current transport dilemma. The management of Seamount secondary school is now prepared to participate in a shared catchment area, but the management of Gort community school is opposed to any change.</P>
      <P>In 1998 a small number of girls from the Kinvara catchment area, who would not ordinarily qualify for transport to another catchment area, were allowed to board the bus at the same point as their brothers who had a full transport entitlement to the Gort school provided no extra State cost was involved. This was done in the unusual circumstances where members of the same household were appropriate to separate catchment areas on the basis of their gender.</P>
      <P>A similar situation did not exist in respect of girls from the Gort area who wished to travel to the Kinvara school. In their case, there was no question of members of the same household being appropriate to different catchment areas. In addition, there was no existing service to accommodate such pupils. It would also have been a clear infringement of the catchment boundary system which would have required the agreement of both schools to a single catchment area.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the most that could be offered to these pupils was catchment boundary facilities from the nearest pick-up point in the Kinvara area, provided there was spare accommodation on the bus. If agreement can be reached between the management authorities of both schools on a shared catchment area, I will provide transport to both schools under the normal conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm he met deputations representing the parents and board of management of Kinvara school on 21 June 2000 and indicated to them that he hoped this issue would be resolved? Will he also confirm that one of his Ministers of State violated the Department's rules by making a special arrangement for temporary tickets for children travelling from the Kinvara catchment area to Gort? It is ridiculous to state that such transport can only be provided where space is available on buses. The Minister should not allow one board of management to veto another on the issue of school transport. Neither should his Department discriminate against girls who wish to attend Seamount convent while allowing pupils from Kinvara to travel to the school in Gort. The Minister of State's action concealed this discrimination through the provision of temporary tickets in 1998 which, through human error, are still in operation. The situation is untenable and there is an obligation on the Minister to make a decision. He had the report for three months and still did not make a decision which would provide the students who wish to attend school in Kinvara with their due entitlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In an attempt to be helpful and resolve this dispute, the Minister of State introduced revised terms which meant that in the unusual circumstances where members of the same household are appropriate to separate catchment areas on the basis of their gender, pupils who would not ordinarily qualify for transport to another catchment area may be allowed to board the bus at the same point as those with a full transport entitlement provided no extra State cost is involved. Where girls from the same household as boys travelling to the community school from within the Kinvara catchment area had to go to the boundary of the catchment area to be picked up, they were allowed to board at the same place as their brothers. That was a humanitarian arrangement. This matter could be resolved if the two schools would agree to one catchment area. The area in question is a large one and the two schools &ndash; an all-girls school and a community school &ndash; are quite far apart. It would not seem overly difficult to combine the catchment area. Originally, neither school was prepared to share a catchment area, but the Kinvara school has subsequently agreed to this. I could ask the management of the Gort school to consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>I fully support the RAPID programme targeted at the 25 most concentrated areas of urban disadvantage in the country as there is undoubtedly a strong link between poor educational achievement and socio-economic deprivation. Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, up to £5.35 billion will be provided for education, including social inclusion and lifelong learning measures and education infrastructure. The RAPID programme will prioritise and front-load expenditure to tackle the varying needs and priorities of each area.</P>
      <P>While my Department, as currently structured, is not in a position at present to provide representation on each of the 25 RAPID area implementation teams, it is implementing a programme of structural reform which will in time create the capacity to participate in local and regional developments, such as the RAPID initiative.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I recently nominated seven senior personnel to support the work of the 14 local drugs task forces. These task forces are considered by the Government to be the initial high priority areas in view of the serious drug problems being experienced by these communities.</P>
      <P>My Department has an extensive range of programmes for individual schools serving areas of greatest disadvantage. These include Giving Children an Even Break &ndash; the new programme for primary school pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds which incorporates schools which already have designated disadvantaged status and schools in the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle. The stay in school retention initiative at second level in 117 schools draws on the experience of integrated services from the 8-15 early school leaver initiative. The home school community liaison scheme promotes parental collaboration with teachers in children's learning.</P>

        <b>: </b>I have spoken briefly to the Minister about this case. I know he has many special cases, but he should accept that this is genuinely a special case as Aghamore national school is 100 years old; it celebrated its centenary last August. Three teachers work in three rooms as there is no general purpose room. There are no <Col N="347" /> recreational facilities other than a very small yard. Is the Minister aware that pupil numbers at the school are expanding, which is almost unique for a rural school, and that this is leading to overcrowding? A fourth teacher will probably be employed at the school. In the light of these facts, will the Minister examine the files to enable him to make a root and branch assessment of the merits of the project? The special circumstances I have outlined mean that the project should be sanctioned as soon as possible.</P>

        <b>: </b>In the context of the special difficulties, is the Minister aware that radon levels in the school are considerably above the minimum safety levels for schools? Does he accept that it would be a waste to install radon mitigation measures? I call on the Minister, finally, to view the school as a special case. I have a special affinity with it; my mother, who is 93, attended the school around 1914. I ask the Minister to take all factors into consideration and to be as sympathetic as possible to the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1999, a decision was taken to amalgamate the senior and two junior comprehensive schools in Ballymun as the three existing schools, which were designed to accommodate in excess of 2,000 students, had a combined enrolment of fewer than 800. This development necessitated that serious consideration be given to rationalisation and the more efficient use of all the accommodation for educational purposes.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the schools will amalgamate into the junior schools complex, which can accommodate approximately 1,500 students. To enable the amalgamation to take place, the junior school building must be refurbished. In that regard, a schedule of accommodation based on a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 students has been prepared and accepted by the joint board of management of the three schools. A full design team has been appointed and is engaged in the architectural planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> Officials of the building unit of my Department recently wrote to the schools' management authorities inviting them to a meeting to review progress on the project. I understand a meeting has been arranged for early next week at which all matters concerning this important project will be discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister be more specific on the proposed timescale because the amalgamation was announced over two years ago? Has he satisfied himself that accommodation for 1,000 pupils will be adequate to meet the needs of a regenerated Ballymun area and the target increase in participation rates? The completion rate to leaving certificate in the area stands at just over 30%. In the context of targeting increased participation and retention rates, the figure of 1,000 seems inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the prepared estimates and considered adequate. They take into consideration the views of the local authority and building in the area. Time has been taken to work out what is expected. One issue having an effect is that the number of children per household is much smaller now and areas which formerly would have created a large demand for a school now only create one third of that demand.</P>

A planning and briefing meeting was held in October 2000 at which a design team was asked to prepare a stage 2 outline sketch scheme. It was envisaged that the project might be ready by October 2001, but the team has run into difficulties in the preparation. It is those internal difficulties it wants to discuss next week.</P>

      <P>We left it up to them.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the primary schools sports initiative, which I launched earlier this year. This initiative will help to promote physical education and healthy lifestyles in primary schools. A pilot project is being developed in selected schools early in the new year. The purpose of the pilot project is to prepare the way for the roll-out of the new primary school physical education syllabus.</P>
      <P>I have established a task force chaired by the well-known Dublin footballer, Charlie Redmond. This task force will provide assistance in promoting sport and healthy lifestyles among primary school children. I have also appointed a national sports co-ordinator and two assistant co-ordinators to work with the task force. This initiative, together with the revised primary curriculum, will enhance PE provision in our primary schools.</P>
      <P>I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools last year. Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged and schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000, 1,269.74, per school while all other schools will receive £500, 634.87, per school. Circular 28/00 which issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000 outlines specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. This year's grant, amounting to £1.858 million, 2,359 million, issued to all primary schools in March 2001.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 the Government directed that suitable provision be made for PE facilities when new second level schools are being planned or when existing schools are being extended. This initiative means that all new schools which have an enrolment in excess of 450 students qualify for a PE hall of 608mf7&gt;2. Likewise, when an existing school does not have a PE hall, provision is made for a PE hall of 608mf7&gt;2. This area refers to the floor area of the hall and does not take account of ancillary accommodation, which can add in excess of a further 200mf7&gt;2 to the overall size of the facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools which have an enrolment of between 200 and 449 students qualify for a PE hall of 406mf7&gt;2. Ancillary accommodation can add a further 200mf7&gt;2 of accommodation to this floor area giving a total area in excess of 600mf7&gt;2. The <Col N="352" /> needs of smaller schools for PE facilities are assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>The needs of schools that do not have a PE hall and do not have a capital project in planning will be addressed by the development of generic PE hall templates, which are currently being prepared within the building unit of my Department. The templates will standardise the construction of PE halls at second level schools and will reduce the architectural planning processes considerably. The templates are being piloted in four schools initially and are expected to be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The infrastructural programme is a very significant element of developing PE programmes in our schools and I am committed, within the resources available to my Department, to enhancing this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of congratulations to the Irish soccer team but I hasten to add that few of them benefited from PE at national school level.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that 54% of all national schools do not have a general purposes room? More than three quarters of all primary schools report that because of inadequate space they cannot fully implement the physical education programme and more than two thirds of all schools report that they need either additional or replacement physical education equipment. This indicates our lack of seriousness regarding physical education at primary level and the Minister is presiding over this lack of seriousness.</P>

Many of these were one teacher schools until the Government came to office and decided that every one teacher school should be given a second teacher. That is not to take from the fact that this is an area of great deficit and that all these schools need extra facilities. Today I signed a contract for PE halls in five schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>A final formal offer of £27 per hour for supervision and substitution has been put to the three teacher unions. The Irish National Teachers Organisation executive has recommended acceptance and their members are being balloted at present. A result of the ballot is expected tomorrow, 16 November. The Teachers Union of Ireland put the offer to ballot and it was rejected by a small majority. The Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland Executive Committee voted not to put the offer to a ballot.</P>
      <P>My Department's officials met representatives of the three teacher unions on Friday, 2 November. At the meeting the ASTI, supported by the TUI and the INTO, submitted a number of points for consideration and clarification. These relate to the core issues of pay, hours and pensionability and to operational arrangements. The three teacher unions have indicated that they wish to have further discussions with my Department. These discussions will be facilitated and my officials will continue to meet the teacher unions as necessary to clarify aspects of the offer. It has been made clear that there will be no improvement to the core terms of the offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of the three unions have rejected the offer as it stands and we await the result of the INTO ballot. Either way, will the Minister indicate the next step? Several union representatives have alluded to the concern that the proposed allowance of £27 per hour will not be pensionable. Does the Minister hold out any hope of a change of mind in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues are being discussed in the context of the core requirements of the PPF, which the Deputy will understand must stand. I must say that to avoid any misunderstanding. The teacher's part-time rate is £20.54 per hour and it covers one hour teaching plus preparation and correction time. The supervision and substitution covered in this agreement relates purely to time spent in direct supervision and substitution and the rate of £27 compares very favourably with the highest rates of overtime payable anywhere in the public service. This is especially the case when the maximum delivery is limited to one and a half hours per week and where teachers will not be required to work outside the normal working day or unsocial hours. Overtime of one and a half hours per week would usually attract the lowest rate, usually time plus a quarter. A teacher who volunteers for the scheme will stand to earn a minimum of £1,000 per <Col N="356" /> annum, with an overall limit of £1,323 per annum where the maximum of 49 hours is worked.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the question of pensionability is one of the issues that arises. A difficulty here is that since some of the unions, for example the ASTI, insist that it must be voluntary it affects pensionability, I would be happy if it was built into the system as a normal arrangement, where it could become pensionable. These are some of the issues under discussion to see if a way forward can be found.</P>
      <P>The general rules on pensionability were summarised in the recent report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The report states: &ldquo;The general rule under public service pension schemes is that allowances in the nature of pay are pensionable if they are of a permanent nature or are for extra or inconvenient hours of duty and if a regular and recurring feature of the job and a compulsory condition of service, for example, unsocial hours, duties and shift allowance.&rdquo;  I expect discussion to take place within these parameters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the three unions are in negotiation with the Minister and his Department officials. Is the Minister aware of the frustration within all three unions and among all members of the teaching profession? The detail of an allowance of £27 for supervision is important, but lying behind the claim is frustration with the Department regarding its failure to recognise the need for a substantial pay increase to the teaching profession for the work undertaken by teachers. If disruption starts on this issue arising from the stance of the various unions we will face another year of turmoil where students will be denied proper education facilities.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that his representative in negotiation with the unions will go all the way and not be as dogmatic as he has indicated in terms of the offer on the £27 allowance being the end of the road. If we pursue that course we will be walking a tightrope and it ill behoves the Minister to embark on that for a further year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate we are dealing with public servants who are governed by the rules of the public service, as are Deputies and others involved in the public service. We must, therefore, work within those rules and anyone engaged in negotiations is aware of that. It means that anything applying in one situation must apply in most others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions are ongoing and I am anxious to have the outstanding issues resolved. Earlier in the year it was said to me that if there could be a reasonable approach to supervision and substitution that could lead to a better situation in the autumn. I worked on that basis and got the parties into negotiations. I twice went back to <Col N="357" /> Government to get the rates increased and we succeeded in doing so. The logical rate for supervision was considered to be the rate applying to part-time teachers but we secured an increase on that. In general terms it was considered to be a reasonable offer by those involved in the negotiations but the terms were subsequently rejected. In the case of the ASTI, the 23 person committee accepted the offer but it was rejected by the 180 person committee and it was not put to members.</P>
    <P>There is little more I can do in such circumstances but I want to use the resolution of this issue as a springboard for developing a much better working relationship with the teachers' unions based on goodwill. By next year teachers will have received a 21.6% increase plus a 1% once-off payment. The demand initially was for an increase of 30%. This does not take account of the benchmarking process, which will be considered next June, with a quarter of any payment made retrospectively to next month. I am not sure if people fully realise how much of what they sought in the first instance has been granted through the PPF and the potential for further increases within the benchmarking system. It is good to note that the three unions want to discuss matters further. I will be as supportive as I can in those discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he would be happy to see the allowance of £27 per hour become pensionable if the voluntary nature of the work was removed. On the wider pay issue, there are issues of concern to parents such as lack of progress on home-school evaluation and the holding of staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings and inservice training during the school day. Are these issues on the table for discussion in the context of the benchmarking process? Surely if a substantial pay claim is being considered it should be used as an opportunity to deal with a number of outstanding issues which are principally of concern to parents. I would like the Minister to confirm that these issues are being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the voluntary issue, the difficulty is that especially among ASTI teachers there is a sizeable number who do not want to participate in supervision. There are others who are prepared to do it and would be happy for it to be part of their normal work. The difficulty is that it cannot just be voluntary, which is that a person does it now and then; it has to be built in as a regular part of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say too much as negotiations are under way and I naturally want to see teachers getting something worthwhile from their point of view and to have the matter resolved. There could be ways of meeting their needs, and this is something that will be discussed at the talks. Teachers know I would like to see a resolution and there may not be too big a gap in that <Col N="358" /> context. The view of those involved in the negotiations and of many teachers is that if that was resolved it would help a lot of other things.</P>
    <P>The broad range of issues will be considered in the context of the benchmarking process, which I am attending. There are specific representatives attending that process from all the public service groups, and that process is well under way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 20 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding to primary and second level schools on the basis of <i>per capita</i> grants with additional grants towards ancillary services such as caretaking and secretarial. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951 per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003 as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618 in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and postprimary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, 50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, 126.98, per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum.</P>
    <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the school services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20, 25.40, per pupil to £50, 63.49, per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70, 88.88, per pupil next September and to £78, 99.04 per pupil in January 2003.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. These increases are in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.</P>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000, 5,078.96, to £15,600, 19,807.91, per year while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000, 12,697.38, to £39,000, 49,519.79, over this school year and the next. In the case of second level schools receiving grants of £55, 69.84, per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to a maximum of £19,250, 24,442.46, per school, the annual grant of £78, 99.04, under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250, 73,962.24, per year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that my Department has issued circulars to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. It is intended that payments will issue to schools shortly. However, I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="360" /> ment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools. I am aware that FÁS has issued guidelines to its regional offices that reflect the agreement that I have referred to above.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister for Education and Science is in the House in light of the <Col N="361" /> announcement made today regarding the Book of Estimates and the increased allocation for the Department.</P>
      <P>Some 97 children attend Ardkeeran National School. In November 1999 an application was made for a new school. A report on the school was carried out by the environmental health department of Markievicz House in Sligo. Two classrooms are inadequate in terms of size for the number of students. In order to provide a room for the new remedial teacher the cloakroom area for senior children has been moved into the corridor, which makes the area unsafe. A staff room has not been provided and storage and cleaning facilities are also inadequate. The play area is also inadequate for the number of students attending the school.</P>
      <P>There are many defects in the school structure, including the following. A large number of the timber window frames are rotten and in defective condition and need replacing. The base of the external door located adjacent to the girls' sanitary accommodation is in rotten condition with a large gap underneath the door. This problem requires immediate attention as, at the time of inspection, there was evidence of rodents in the centre of the classroom, and the door should be repaired. Both drinking water fountains were out of order at the time of inspection and should be replaced. The surfaces of some of the storage heaters were in a dirty and rusty condition. Much of the paintwork throughout the school, especially in the girls' accommodation, is defective. Some sections of the concrete surface in the yard are uneven. The sanitary accommodation is totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>The school was built in 1904 and has accommodation for 94 children. Last Sunday evening I visited the school with a number of other local representatives. It is unbelievable, and clearly the case for a new school has been well made by the school management.</P>
      <P>The Bishop of Elphin has offered two sites through the management board. On 15 February the Department's architects inspected the sites, but no final report has been issued to the board of management. On 11 January 2001 the Department stated in a letter that its official had examined the existing school site and had deemed it unsuitable. It is a land locked site and we are extremely fortunate that the Bishop has offered two very extensive sites free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister outlining the level of funding available for new schools. I will expect the Minister to indicate clearly the timescale for the development of a new school for Ardkeeran-Riverstown in light of the catalogue of inefficiencies and deficiencies at the school. I know he is committed to funding primary schools and I appeal to him to send his officials back to that school. The management board has sought clarification on many points. There is a huge lack of <Col N="362" /> co-ordination. Correspondence has been issued by the management board which has not been reacted to by the Department, which disappoints me. Having attended a meeting last Sunday evening, there is great concern that 97 children now attend this school. I was also shocked at that.</P>
    <P>We are now in a new millennium. This school was funded by the British in 1904 and I hope that by 2004, or before that date, a new school will be provided for Riverstown. I am anxiously awaiting the Minister's clarification which will give some indication of the funding and timescale in regard to this new school which is urgently required. Given the Minister's announcement today, the allocation of £97 million in the Estimates by the Minister for Finance, and the increase this year, I have no doubt a new school for Riverstown will be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation for Ardkeeran national school. At present, the school has a staffing level of a principal, three mainstream classroom teachers, a learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher. The enrolment on 30 September 2000 was 91 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of three permanent classrooms and one prefab.</P>
      <P>My Department has received an application from the management authorities of the school for grant assistance towards the provision of a new school. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a major increase in the funds allocated by the Government to the school building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, which is almost four times the allocation made in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects. It is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. The Estimates to which the Deputy referred will enable me to continue that rate of progress.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress of individual cases, including any proposed project for Ardkeeran national school, will be taken as in <Col N="363" /> previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been made by the Government.</P>
    <P>I have noted what the Deputy said about this school. I thank him for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position concerning the accommodation needs of Ardkeeran national school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Acting Chairman, for permitting me to raise this important issue. Absenteeism from school is very high in parts of my constituency. The enforcement of school attendance has been neglected in the county area of Dublin for many years. Local surveys show how serious is the problem. Those children who avoid school at an early age have very poor prospects. Their life chances are dramatically reduced as a result of absenteeism which, in turn, leads to early school drop-out.</P>
      <P>More than two years ago a committee in my constituency, comprising teachers, parents and others in the Killenarden area, found that almost 20% of 2,000 pupils were regularly absent from school. This is an alarming conclusion which requires urgent and effective redress. Those concerned with the initiative at the time believed that the Education Welfare Act, 2000, would make a substantial contribution to tackling the problem since it envisaged the early appointment of school attendance officers, called education welfare officers, at least in the disadvantaged areas. It must be remembered that schools in my area of County Dublin have not had school attendance officers and it was not a function appropriate to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, has failed to implement the provisions of this Act. He has failed to appoint school attendance officers, even in the catchment areas of schools designated disadvantaged. This is a major disappointment to educationalists, teachers and parents who believed that at last school attendance would be enforced by trained professional personnel. As there is a downturn in the economy, people are concerned that if the Minister was unable to make a decision in boom times will he make the necessary decisions when economic conditions are less buoyant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is still the principal transmitter of privilege in society. What chance in the knowledge economy have children who habitually miss school and drop out early? I have repeatedly raised the issue of the shortage of trained teachers in primary schools in disadvantaged areas in my constituency. I have instanced one such school where no fewer than 21 trained staff <Col N="364" /> have left since 1999 and only nine trained teachers have been appointed to replace them. There is little point in the Minister putting a new law on the Statute Book if the Government deliberately stalls its implementation. I am afraid the Minister has no feel for the inequalities he is perpetuating in disadvantaged areas. Will he at least tell the House tonight that educational welfare officers will be appointed in areas designated disadvantaged by a given date?</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the Deputy's comments that I have no feel for the importance of education. I spent most of my life trying to support young people who are not within the system or getting support from the system. However, when one makes up press statements that sort of thing tends to come out at times.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am pleased the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department's position on this issue. Absenteeism is a major problem, especially in some areas. The Deputy mentioned there are schools in his area where 20% are regularly absent. On 29 May, I announced the establishment of the new National Educational Welfare Board. I launched the work of the board at its first meeting on 15 June 2001.</P>
      <P>The new board has been established on a designate or interim basis to enable it to carry out the necessary planning and preparation work for phasing in an education welfare service, as provided for in the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The Act provides a comprehensive new framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The Act forms an important part of Government policy to tackle disadvantage in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act addresses the underlying causes of non-attendance at school by supporting and encouraging children to attend school on a regular basis and by identifying, at an early stage, children who may be at risk of developing school attendance problems. The new approach shifts the focus of school attendance away from punitive sanctions imposed after a non-attendance pattern is well developed towards a more preventative strategy aimed at assisting children and their families to avoid non-attendance and related problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve the aims and objectives set out in the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board will, among other matters, appoint education welfare officers throughout the country to work in close co-operation with schools, teachers, parents, community-voluntary groups and other State agencies and bodies with a view to encouraging and promoting regular school attendance and developing <Col N="365" /> strategies to reduce absenteeism and early school leaving. The designate board is moving forward with the planning and preparatory work for the start-up of the new service. This will include the recruitment of the relevant staff, including education welfare officers. The existing school attendance officers will also be transferred to the board under the Act.</P>

It is my intention and that of the board that the new services will be phased in as soon as possible. They will replace the existing school attendance service, which continues for the present.</P>
      <P>I intend to put the designate board on a statutory basis as soon as possible, in other words, as soon as steps which it has to take under the Act are completed to enable me to convert it to a statutory board. I hope this will be done very soon. A key factor is that the board will have the necessary legal standing to appoint staff when it is in a position to do so and according as the planning and preparatory work is advanced.</P>
      <P>The board is up and running and making its preparations. The Deputy will soon have the situation for which he is hoping. I am very anxious to have the board appointed on a statutory basis. Some of the positions to be filled have been agreed, including the appointment of a director at a very high level. The board is very pleased with this and has the agreement of the Department of Finance. I will make the necessary statutory orders as soon as the board is ready.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> Engine breakdown, signal failure, points failure, lack of platform space, leaves on the line, birds in the air, inadequate number of drivers to replace those on sick leave, windows which will not open, lack of extra carriages and the lack of a rail loop line at Howth Junction are only some of the excuses and reasons given by Iarnród Éireann for the disastrous rail service provided for the commuters of Balbriggan, Skerries, Lusk, Rush, Donabate, Portrane, Malahide and Portmarnock in my constituency. Many of these problems have been evident for some time, but in recent weeks the service deteriorated to the point of disaster. I call on the Minister for Public Enterprise to ascertain what immediate works can be carried out to improve the service by the provision of additional carriages and committing to CIE the permission to raise the necessary funds &ndash; about £300 million &ndash; to create a loop line at Howth Junction, which is blocking extra service.</P>
    <P>On 5 November all commuter traffic from north Dublin was directed to divert to Ballymun Road and the Malahide Road and onto public services. That announcement was a sick joke. Even a self-respecting sardine would not try to get on a train coming in from north Dublin. Last week the 8.10 a.m. train, which was already running late, left 50 passengers standing on the platform at Lusk. On another recent evening the DART failed dismally at Malahide. In two trains from Dublin passengers were so tightly jammed, or imprisoned, for two hours that women who fainted or collapsed in the carriages had no room to fall and had to be supported by other passengers. If the Minister for Public Enterprise does not take action on this rail service, she will take the responsibility when a major accident occurs, with serious injury and loss of life.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has a policy to house people along rail lines, but there is no room on trains. I put it to the Minister for Public Enterprise that people have been duped on the basis of a public transport system which does not accommodate them. I hope she will ensure extra carriages are made available, that platforms are lengthened and a new loop line is built at Howth Junction to increase the service. I am issuing a warning, through the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, that I will raise this issue every week, if I have to, until I see some improvements. As a Deputy for Dublin North, I will not preside over the carnage that will occur if the doors on one of these trains burst open at any time due to the overload of passengers intimately pressed shoulder to shoulder and body to body on this appalling daily journey.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an dTeachta Owen as ucht a cuid ama a roinnt liom. As the Minister of State may already know, I am sick of the situation which <Col N="367" /> Deputy Owen has so graphically described in relation to the rail service in Dublin North. I am also sick of hearing the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, making light of very chronic problems &ndash; chronic overcrowding, gross mismanagement and under-resourcing of the northern suburban line and the DART. She has said she cannot be expected to be responsible for train windows which will not open, or overcrowding, or people fainting. To me, she sounds like a Minister who is out of touch and very irresponsible in her job. I appreciate that she has many important things to do, but if she is serious about delivering results during her time in office, she should ensure these matters are dealt with. These are the issues which people are discussing and on which the Government is being measured and found wanting in terms of public transport.</P>
      <P>People have often asked when was the last time the Minister travelled on the 5.15 p.m. train, northbound from Pearse Station, on the line serving Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Rush, Lusk, Skerries and Balbriggan. If she did, or if she came in from any of those stations between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., she would have a different tune. She would realise that people are at the point of equating this experience with a denial of civil liberties, not just because of the dangers they face and the huge distress of people around them fainting, with nowhere to fall because of the overcrowding, but also because they see that the Minister is not identifying with their needs. Former Deputy Ray Burke was well practiced at taking a short hop from one station to the next, mingling and rubbing shoulders in the process and then getting back into his car to complete his journey into town. At least, it was possible for him to get on the train at the time. I doubt that any Deputy could now get on one of those trains, walk through the carriages and get off at the next station &ndash; they would simply be unable to move.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputies Owen and Sargent on raising this important issue. The national development plan provides for the investment of £185 million, 235 million, in suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area. Significant progress has been made in implementing the ambitious programme contained in the plan. larnród Éireann has informed the Minister that, in the past 12 months, 26 new DART cars have entered service, an increase of over 30% in capacity. They are to be supplemented next year by a further 12 which were delivered last month and are undergoing testing. These developments will provide for an increase of approximately 50% in the capacity of the DART system. The company still holds options on a further 36 DART cars. larnród Éireann has also placed orders for a total of 80 diesel rail cars for use <Col N="368" /> throughout its network. Some of these cars will be used to replace outdated stock on the outer suburban lines, while others will be used to provide increased capacity and more frequent services.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has also developed investment proposals for a major upgrade in the DART network to provide further significant increases in capacity beyond 2002. The proposals provide for the lengthening of platforms to accommodate eight car trains, a major upgrade of the signalling capacity to allow an increased number of trains in the city centre area and increased power supply for operating the enhanced network. The Department is in ongoing discussion with larnród Éireann in relation to these proposals. A total of £3.5 million, 4.45 million, was allocated by the Department in 2001 in respect of planning and design work for the DART upgrades. Further details of the timescales involved will be determined as planning and design progresses. Iarnród Éireann has advised the Minister that it has recorded an increase in passenger numbers of approximately 15% since the work on the port access tunnel at its proposed junction with the M1 at Whitehall began.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening I would like to highlight a relatively new situation that faces many hundreds of grandparents in some deprived parts of Dublin. I am not suggesting for a moment that the issue is confined to Dublin, but I have no information in relation to people outside the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three weeks ago I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, to inform me as to the number of children who were waiting to be placed in foster care. The information supplied by the Minister suggested that over 300 children nationally were waiting to find foster care families. Almost half of these children lived in the Dublin region. On receipt of this information I publicly called on <Col N="369" /> the relevant health boards to redouble their efforts to find more foster care families and offer more support to parents who are providing a home for children who find themselves in this difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Following this call, I was approached by a number of women who now want their stories told in public. In recent weeks I have come into contact with many people who have become foster care parents for their children's children. Mothers who have reared their children must now become, not by choice or design, the new foster care parents to a generation of children from broken and dysfunctional families.</P>
    <P>The following case illustrates this new phenomenon. A woman from Dublin in her early 50s who has reared her family has recently provided a home for her daughter's two young children. Her daughter is a recovering drug abuser who was unable to cope. This grandparent had to physically break into her daughter's local authority house where she found the children neglected and their mother high on drugs. For the past year this woman has raised these children in the full knowledge of the social services, but has received absolutely nothing from the State during this time. In fact, she was advised by her social worker to abandon the children in the local crèche and to then apply as a foster care parent three days later, at which point she would be entitled to the foster care payment. The social worker in this case has already confirmed in writing these children have lived with their grandparent for the past year. Because the grandmother is providing a home for these children, they are not seen as a priority. Priority is not attached to those children who would be in hopeless situations were it not for the intervention of their immediate family. These grandparents are necessarily being punished for providing care.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, this young mother was allowed to leave the Coombe women's hospital as a known drug abuser. At no point did a public health nurse or doctor visit the young children or the mother since then.</P>
    <P>This grandparent is now looking after two children and acting as the foster care parent for these children while their mother is recovering from drugs. Questions should be asked about how any recovering drug addict could be able to provide the type of stability that is needed for children.</P>
    <P>When this grandparent applied for child benefit, she was turned down. When she applied for child dependant allowance, she was turned down. When she sought support from the local social services, her particular needs were turned down. This is not an isolated case. This woman and countless others are saving the State a fortune in that they are caring for their children's children in the local community where they still have access to both parents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> I believe that where members of an extended family are prepared to foster a member of their immediate family, the foster care payment should apply. Many grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose mothers and fathers have become completely disconnected from mainstream society. While there is an on-going debate surrounding the new role of grandparents, particularly where grandparents are providing a child minding service for both working parents, we have, as a society, failed to recognise the hopeless situation that confronts many parents who are dependent on drugs and who simply cannot cope.</P>
    <P>In short, fewer children would present for either foster care or adoption if their extended families were given the support that is needed for them to remain in the local community. The case I have brought to the attention of the Dáil highlights the new reality that confronts policy makers in the area of child care provisions. The grandparent to whom I have referred could receive £200 per week if she decided to foster a child she had never met. However, this woman is already fostering two children without any financial support from the State at a time in her life when her children are reared. I believe there is a profound injustice in this. This woman wants the State to recognise the situation that she and hundreds of other families face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for raising this urgent matter. At the end of 2000 there were 790 children placed in relative care compared to 635 at the end of 1998, which represents an increase of 24%. The figures for non-relative foster care were 3,424 and 3,201, respectively, an increase of 7%.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Child Care Act, 1991, the health boards are the statutory authorities charged with the duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The Act provides that a health board shall take into care, either on a voluntary basis or under a court order, a child who resides or is found in its area who requires care and protection that he or she is unlikely to receive unless he or she is taken into its care. It is, therefore, a matter for the health board to make a decision as to whether a child needs to be taken into care and provide the most appropriate form of alternative care for that child.</P>
      <P>Children who are taken into the care of the health board can be placed in residential care, foster care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995, or in relative care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Relative Care) Regulations, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foster care allowances are paid in respect of children placed in care under these regulations. Under the regulations a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suit<Col N="371" /> ability of the prospective foster or relative carer. A care plan must also be drawn up for the child and regular reviews carried out. The implementation of the care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether they are relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional cost of looking after foster children.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations it is possible for a health board to place a child with relatives in an emergency. However, the board must ensure that its regulatory obligations in relation to the assessment of the child's needs and relatives are carried out as soon as is practicable and that they conform to all the other obligations in relation to care plans and reviews.</P>
    <P>The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care &ndash; A Child Centred Partnership, which was published in May of this year. The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives as follows: the guiding tenet of best interests of the child should be adhered to in all foster and relative care placements; a child should only be placed in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; placements should only be made where there is a secure attachment between the child or relative or there is the potential for such <Col N="372" /> an attachment to develop; a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care and placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.</P>
    <P>As the figures indicate, this form of alternative care is increasing. However, the report emphasised that although the child is placed with other family members, he or she is still in the care of the board and the board therefore has the ultimate responsibility for his or her health, welfare and safety. The report stated that, as a basic principle, a child placed with relatives must receive the same level of protection, care and support as a child placed with non-relatives. Therefore, even where the child is already in the care of the relative, the health board must carry out the necessary assessment of the child's needs and the assessment, training and support for relative carers, which allow them to ensure that this is the case.</P>
    <P>The report recognises that some of the criteria in assessing relative care <i>vis-à-vis</i> non-relative care may be different. The issue of standards in relation to assessments, training, support and supervision in relative care are being considered in the context of the national standards on practices and procedures in foster care, which are being drawn, at present, by a sub-committee of the Irish social services inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 November 2001.</P>

      <P>There are now more guidance counsellors employed by schools than at any previous time and, as a result, schools, whatever their size, are in a position to ensure that pupils have access to counselling and career guidance by qualified personnel. I recently announced the allocation of 50 additional posts to schools in order to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects. This initiative, which benefits 103 schools, is being monitored by a group representative of the partners in education. The National Centre for Guidance in Education, NCGE, has provided a wide range of support materials for guidance counsellors and schools generally. It is currently finalising new and detailed guidelines for schools on guidance provision. It is important that schools should see guidance as an integral part of whole school provision, and guidance and counselling should form part of the school development planning process. Schools are also encouraged to use resources provided under other initiatives, such as the stay at school retention initiative, to enhance their guidance provision, especially for those pupils most at risk.</P>
      <P>The results of an audit of guidance provision in all second-level schools, commissioned by my Department, have recently been published. It is clear from the audit that a significant number of schools are not fully utilising the resources currently being made available to them for guidance and, in many schools, the service is not adequately targeted at pupils at risk. In these circumstances, a priority for me is to ensure the resources made available to schools for guidance are fully utilised for that purpose. In line with the Government's priority to promote social inclusion, a second priority for me is to ensure that those young people who are most at risk of dropping out of education early are a major focus of guidance provision in schools. As a result, any future enhancement of provision to individual schools will be conditional on their making a commitment to providing a service to all their pupils which would reflect both Government priorities and pupils' needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is taking part in an international study of guidance provision currently being undertaken by the OECD in 15 countries. The study involves a detailed examination by an expert team from <Col N="374" /> the OECD of all aspects of guidance provision for both school pupils and adults. This country will be the first country to be examined by the experts, whose report will be published by the OECD during 2002.</P>

      <P>I would be most anxious that all assessment reports which identify the need for special educational interventions, including reports relating to children with dyslexia, would be acted upon as speedily as possible. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind he may wish to provide me with details so that the matter can be investigated.</P>
      <P>Since October 1998 all children who have been assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools, including children with dyslexia, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs irrespective of their level of need or location. The educational needs of pupils with dyslexia are generally capable of being met in mainstream schools, with the support, where necessary, of the learning support teacher service. There are 1,485 learning support teachers in place in primary schools. Children whose condition is of a more serious nature may also attend their local school with the support of the resource teacher service. There are approximately 1,000 resource teachers supporting children with special needs in primary schools, including children with dyslexia. For some children, the severity of the condition may be such as to require placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. A range of such facilities is available.</P>
      <P>All schools have been notified of the procedures to be followed where special support services are required for children with special needs, including children with dyslexia. The procedures in question require that the school forward copies of available assessment reports and any other relevant data to the local schools' inspector so that a decision can be made on the allocation of any necessary supports.</P>

      <P>While the amount of the minimum contribution that may be donated to a school to qualify for tax relief is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, I am not aware of concerns at school level as referred to by the Deputy. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has in recent years placed a high priority on increasing funding to schools. At second-level, the <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. I further increased the grant by £8 from September last year to £192 and by £10 from September this year, bringing the standard <i>per capita</i> grant to more than £200 for the first time. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total annual grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have introduced the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. Under the fund, a school with 500 pupils now receives additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. I have recently announced further significant increases in the support grant to schools. With immediate effect, the annual grant will be increased from £20 per pupil to £50 per pupil, with a further increase to £70 per pupil next September and to £78 per pupil in January 2003. The minimum annual grant for smaller schools will also be increased from £4,000 to £15,600, while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 to £39,000 over this school year and the next.</P>
      <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Until quite recently the majority of second level schools did not use information technology facilities in the teaching of the physical science subjects. In response to this and as part of the Government's initiative to promote the physical sciences, last year I sanctioned the payment of grants amounting to £10,500 per school for the purpose of acquiring equipment for use in science laboratories including information technology equipment. Circular letter 53/2000, which was issued from my Department in December of last year, recommended that schools acquire data logging equipment &ndash; hardware, software and sensors-probes &ndash; for the teaching of the physical sciences at senior and junior cycle levels in second levels schools. Data logging equipment facilitates a range of class experiments involving the collection of data by students in real time, and the storage and analysis of the data using graphic calculators. Students can download data to a computer for further analysis as required. Additionally, data logging equipment is readily capable of collecting data outside the laboratory and permits demonstration and experiments in real time using a PC and a wide range of sensors for example temperature, light, voltage and motion. In addition to the benefits outlined above, data logging equipment with graphic calculators can be used in the teaching of biology and mathematics.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, technology is in a state of continual evolution, including the emerging technology of miniature palm personal computers, and these may indeed have useful and valuable application in classrooms and laboratories in the future. I must follow a prudent course, however, and the new technology, unlike the data loggers with graphic calculators, is not yet fully proven in the educational world. Clearly it may receive greater endorsement in the future that is grounded in the experience of the science community and that goes beyond supplier claims. For the moment, however, it makes very good sense to recommend systems that have a proven international track record. I will of course keep developments under review.</P>

      <P>My Department does not keep a record of the number of educational needs questionnaires it issues at second level. Such question<Col N="377" /> naires are not issued at primary level. Educational needs questionnaires are used to assist my Department in helping parents of children who are having difficulty securing a second level school placement. This may be as a result of expulsion, delay by the parents in seeking to enrol their child or no school place available for the child, perhaps because the local schools have reached their capacity or the school may require additional resources to meet the specific needs of the child. My Department is dealing with approximately 130 cases of parents having such difficulties at second level. Educational needs questionnaires are a very helpful tool in the identification of the child's educational needs and provide written parental permission to contact schools and the National Educational Psychological Service on behalf of their child. When a completed educational needs questionnaire is returned, my Department endeavours, through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate, to secure as soon as possible, a suitable school placement for the child. It must be noted that my Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil.</P>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, provides that each school board of management must publish the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, including the policy of the school relating to the admission of students. The Act has also made provision for new appeal procedures to address grievances at school level, including expulsion and refusal of a school to enrol a student. These procedures will bring a greater transparency to decisions by schools in relation to expulsion and also promote fair procedures at school level. In particular, the right to appeal to a national appeals committee in relation to a decision by a school to expel will bring a better balance to the rights and obligations of all concerned.</P>

The report, which extends to more than 500 pages, deals with a wide range of complex issues and will now require careful consideration in my Department. It is my intention that the report will be made publicly available as soon as possible. With this in mind, arrangements are now being made to have copies of the report printed so that they can be made available to interested parties. Arrangements are also being made to place the report on my Department's web site. During its deliberations, the task force held in excess of 20 <Col N="378" /> meetings and considered more than 100 submissions from interested parties. The members of the task force also received detailed presentations from experts on autism from the US and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute-Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment 1998 early school leavers survey indicates that approximately 81% of students currently complete second level education. This figure is broadly in line with my Department's analysis of data in this area which indicate a retention rate of some 83% when account is taken of factors such as mortality and movement to private schools. While the achievement of a retention rate of 90% has been a long-standing policy objective, it is important to stress that early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and that by their nature interventions require <Col N="379" /> time to make an impact. The problem of early school leaving requires movement on a number of fronts and that is the approach that we are taking. In the first instance it is important that we offer curricular choice which meets the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools. The junior certificate schools programme and the leaving certificate applied are two programmes which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision.</P>
      <P>An important element in improving school attendance and retention rates in our schools is the establishment of the national educational welfare board. The board will play a central role in implementing the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, with a view to promoting regular attendance at school and discouraging early school leaving. Strategies are in place to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. The focus of the 8-15 year old early school leavers initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level, which form part of the school completion programme, is to target resources at those schools and communities experiencing the greatest difficulties with early school leaving. It is only by sustained action across a number of fronts &ndash; curricular, legislative and direct support &ndash; that we will make progress in relation to this intractable problem.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to change the status of Waterford Institute of Technology. In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector subject to regular review. The steering committee report endorsed the maintenance of a diversified system of higher education to meet the varying needs of students, society and the economy. The report did not recommend any change in status of institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the publication of the steering committee's report arrangements were put in place for a process to enable institutes of technology to apply for delegated authority to make awards within a national qualifications framework.</P>
      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of three new bodies: the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC. I established the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland on a statutory basis in February last and the new awarding councils were established in June last.</P>
      <P>Section 29 of the Act provides for the delegation of authority from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, within the framework of qualifications, to an institute of technology to make awards following a review of the Institute concerned. In accordance with the provisions of section 29(8) of the Act, I determined that the review of WIT conducted in 1999 by the Donnelly review group shall be a review for the purposes of this section of the Act and directed that HETAC take the appropriate measures to delegate authority to Waterford Institute of Technology to make higher education and training awards. This has been done.</P>
      <P>My policy is to continue to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education. The diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements. Waterford Institute of Technology will continue to play a major role in Irish higher education.</P>

      <P>Government policy recognises the need to ensure that pupils in every school have the opportunity to become computer literate. To achieve this objective it is necessary to put in place the ICT infrastructure required; ensure that teachers have the appropriate ICT skills; and integrate ICT into the curriculum. Since 1998 significant funding has been made available to schools to allow them to improve and develop their ICT infrastructure and a large-scale teacher training programme has been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of the progress to date is highlighted by a recent survey carried out by the National Centre for Technology in Education which shows that the average primary school has 8.7 computers, up from 3.8 in early 1998; the average second level school has 42.7 computers, up from 31 in early 1998; and more than 95% of schools state that they are using the Internet &ndash; up from only 25% in early 1998 &ndash; and at least <Col N="384" /> 34,000 teachers have attended one or more IT training courses since early 1998.</P>
    <P>To build on these achievements to date, I have recently announced significant additional funding which will allow for further ICT infrastructure development in schools and the development of a teacher ICT training programme which will provide a progression path for teachers in developing the skills required for the integration of ICT into the curriculum. The details of this new initiative will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>As my Department continues to provide the necessary infrastructure to integrate ICTs into teaching and learning, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is examining the issues related to specifying desirable levels of competence which students should reach in using ICT. At primary level, the NCCA has already piloted guidelines on integrating ICT into the teaching and learning environment. These are currently being revised, taking account of comprehensive feedback from teachers.</P>
    <P>The next stage of the process of developing provision for ICT will be to identify, in conjunction with the NCCA, the range of skills and conceptual understanding that pupils should attain through their engagement with ICT right across the curriculum at different levels of education, particularly by the end of the period of compulsory education. This will draw on the best of international practice in this area.</P>
    <P>At leaving certificate level, the NCCA is in the final stages of preparing advice to me on the advisability of introducing a computer-based subject at leaving certificate level. This advice will draw upon a feasibility study conducted by the University of Limerick. The purpose of the study was to ascertain the desirability of such a subject, its possible delivery format, potential content and the impact introducing it would have on the current programme at leaving certificate level. It is in this context that plans will be developed to evaluate progress as regards computer literacy in schools.</P>

      <P>Beginning in the 1970s a number of vocational education committees established outdoor education centres. There are currently nine VEC outdoor education centres recognised by my Department for the purposes of funding. This funding is in the form of a grant towards the staffing and equipment costs in the centres. These grants have been paid since 1988. No centres additional to these nine have been sanctioned by my Department since 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> There are currently three VEC outdoor education centres in operation which are not in receipt of a staffing and equipment grant. Consideration is being given in my Department to the recognition for funding purposes of these centres. Officials of my Department are in negotiation with various representatives of the staff of the recognised outdoor education centres regarding their status, salary, terms and conditions of employment. The regularisation of the staffing position within the centres will represent a major improvement in the operation of the centres. This regularisation of staffing, may however, have significant cost implications for the centres and any new arrangements agreed will be relevant in determining my Department's future budgetary planning and funding strategy for VEC outdoor education centres. It is in this context that recognition for the three centres will be addressed.</P>

      <P>Drugs awareness programmes have been introduced into 94% of primary and 67% of post-primary schools through the Walk Tall and On my Own Two Feet programmes. Up to 3,000 schools at primary level have received detailed educational resource materials and a comprehensive in-career development programme for Walk Tall. In the case of On my Own Two Feet, 1,635 teachers from 522 post-primary schools received resource materials and were trained to implement the programme. Targets for the provision of such programmes in all schools have been set in two contexts.</P>
      <P>Specific measures are being put in place to ensure that all schools within the local drugs task force areas, at both primary and post-primary levels, implement substance misuse prevention programmes. Support officers will shortly be recruited to assist schools with this work.</P>
      <P>In the case of all schools, it is intended that every primary school will incorporate substance misuse prevention programmes within the broad context of social, personal and health education, SPHE, by September 2003. The primary curriculum support programme, PCSP, is organising, on a phased basis, in-career development programmes for all teachers in SPHE. This work will be completed in June 2003 and implementation of the SPHE curriculum will commence in September 2003.</P>
      <P>Since September 2000, SPHE, including substance misuse prevention, is being phased in to all schools at junior cycle, at post-primary level, over a three-year period. This work is being supported by an SPHE support service, which consists of a national co-ordinator and ten regional development officers. This service works in partnership with health promotion personnel in regional health boards.</P>

      <Quest>the reason school secretaries and caretakers do not receive pension cover from his Department; the total number of school secretaries and caretakers in the primary and post-primary school sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding provided by my Department to schools for secretarial and caretaking services is structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants. This provides schools with considerable flexibility in the use of resources as to the manner in which such services are provided. Accordingly, it is not possible to quantify the number of secretaries and caretakers employed by schools as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary and secondary schools, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. Pension scheme arrangements apply since 1985 to secretaries employed under this scheme. The question of introducing a pension scheme for caretakers employed under this scheme was also explored fully in 1985. However, it was considered that the high age profile of caretakers at that time rendered the introduction of a pension scheme impractical. The position regarding the age profile has worsened in the interim. There are no plans at present to introduce such a pension scheme for caretakers employed in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded under the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive scheme. The PESP scheme provides grants to primary and secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role regarding how they are employed. These individualised arrangements preclude a central superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and secretarial staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme-wide basis. The way in which staffing is allocated to schools is a matter for each VEC in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. My Department has made provision for secretarial and caretaking services for all VEC schools with enrolments in excess of 200 pupils. All schools in the community and comprehensive sector have been provided with secretarial and caretaking services. Pension scheme arrangements apply in both the VEC and C&amp;C sectors to secretaries and caretakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> The Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement of further significant increases in the school services support grant for second level schools. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita </i>grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. This funding is in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.</P>

      <P>In my earlier response to the Deputy I indicated that the task force had completed its detailed deliberations and was engaged in finalising the drafting of its report. The report of the task force on dyslexia has been received in my Department in recent days. The report deals with a wide range of complex issues and will now require careful consideration in my Department. In the course of its work, the task force received and considered 396 written submissions and 896 oral submissions from interested parties. It also received presentations from experts in the field of dyslexia from the US and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of the issues involved, I am satisfied the task force completed its work as speedily as possible. I take this opportunity to express my thanks to the chairperson and members of the task force for the commitment they have shown in addressing this very complex area. The work carried out by the task force will be of great value to the future development of services for children with dyslexia.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the report will be made publicly available as soon as possible. With this in mind, arrangements are being made to have copies of the report printed so that they can be made available to interested parties. Arrangements will also be made to place the report on the Department's website.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the ongoing need to continue the development of our special education services. The present Government has been responsible for an unprecedented level of development in the special education area, including the areas to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service, NEPS, which was established in 1999, has responsibility for assessment services. At the time of its establishment, the development plan for the NEPS envisaged that it would achieve nationwide coverage by the end of 2004. However, in July of this year the Government approved the accelerated development of the NEPS in order that it will achieve nationwide coverage by the end of next year, two years ahead of schedule. This decision was taken in order to facilitate more ready access to assessment services by children with special needs. In addition, I have made £1.25 million available to the NEPS in the current year to facilitate the engagement of private educational psychologists to conduct assessments where the NEPS is not in a position to deliver such services on a timely basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since September 1999 the learning support teacher, remedial, service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. At present, there are 1,485 such teachers in place in primary schools and a further 560 in place at second level. In October 1998 the Government took the unprecedented decision that all children with special needs in primary schools should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs irrespective of their level of need or location. As a result of this decision the number of resource teachers in place in the primary sector has been increased from 104 to approximately <Col N="390" /> 1,000. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from less than 300 to more than 2,500 over the same period. At second level, there are currently 380 resource teachers and 135 special needs assistants in place.</P>
    <P>Since 1999, all special schools and special classes dedicated to children with disabilities have been operating at the special reduced pupil-teacher ratios recommended by the special education review committee. In addition to the substantial increase in support services outlined above, the Government has approved my proposals for the establishment of a national council for special education. The council will be charged with providing research, expert advice and carrying out certain operational functions in relation to services for children with disabilities. When established, the national council for special education will play an important role in the future development and delivery of special education services. The measures outlined above provide concrete evidence of my commitment to ensuring the ongoing development of a special education service which is responsive to the needs of all who require it.</P>

      <P>There are general rules about pensionability which were best summarised in the recent report of the commission on public service pensions. The report states that:</P>
      <P>The general rule under public service pension schemes is that allowances in the nature of pay are pensionable if they are of a permanent nature or are for extra or inconvenient hours of duty, if a regular and recurring feature of the job and a compulsory condition of service, e.g. unsocial hours duties and shift allowance.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to rule out the possibility of extending pensionability to overtime generally. While there may be instances where overtime is pensionable it applies only if that overtime is compulsory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Teachers have insisted on a scheme which is voluntary in nature and which will not be a regular and compulsory part of the teachers job. Teachers may volunteer or opt out of the scheme each year and the commitment of hours by those teachers who volunteer may also vary from year to year. In these circumstances the payment cannot be considered for superannuation purposes.</P>

      <P>As a first step towards addressing participation by my Department in local and regional developments, I recently appointed a number of senior personnel to support the work of the 14 local drug task forces.

      <P>In recent years new syllabi and curricula have been devised for second level schools. These have been designed in such a way that the differing needs of a wide range of pupil ability can be catered for by their teachers. The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.</P>
      <P>While content is outlined in the curricula at both levels, process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually and as a member of a group are all encouraged at both levels. While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries is of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.</P>
      <P>Of particular significance at second level are the international olympiads in the science subjects, in information technology and in mathematics, in which the exceptionally able and highest achieving pupils compete. There is also an increase in the number of teachers who are adopting approaches to teaching thinking skills such as de Bono's programme; Feuerstein's instrumental enrichment; and Lipman's philosophy for children.</P>
      <P>In general, schools at both primary and second level attempt to use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department provides funding of £50,000 per annum for the centre for talented youth at Dublin City University to support its work in delivering programmes which are designed specifically for exceptionally able children of first and second level age.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at present to allocate time on the schedules of resource teachers to cater for gifted children.</P>

      <P>The needs of people who, as children, suffered abuse whether in ordinary schools, institutional care or other circumstances are many and complex. The same can be said of the measures which can provide reparation for past abuse, which can include all or some of the following &ndash; counselling, apology from those responsible, providing a listening forum and financial compensation.</P>
      <P>The Government has put in place a range of measures to address the needs of adult victims of abuse in childhood. It has established, through the health boards, dedicated counselling services to victims of abuse, including people who, as children, were abused in day schools. Adult victims of abuse in childhood may also avail of the therapeutic and investigative services of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, established last year under statute. This is a forum where the experiences of victims of abuse will be given a sympathetic hearing and where victims may, in addition, have their experiences inquired into and those responsible held accountable. For those victims of abuse who seek reparation in the form of compensation through the courts, the Government amended the Statutes of Limitation. In the case of a person who suffered sexual abuse and who was advised that his or her claims were statute barred, provision was made for a special one year period, from June 2000 to June of this year, to allow him or her to commence actions against his or her abusers. As regards other kinds of abuse and the application of the statute, the Law Reform Commission has published a discussion document on the broader issue of limitation periods in those cases and is considering the issues further.</P>
      <P>At present the only proposals for the making of financial awards to victims of abuse in childhood, outside the judicial process, are contained in the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001. This Bill does not include victims of abuse in day schools. It applies to orphanages, industrial and reformatory schools and similar institutions. These institutions were those over which the State had significant supervisory or regulatory responsibilities, mainly arising under statute. Children in the institutions were separated from their parents, did not enjoy normal parental care and protection and were under the control of the institutions at all times. They relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them and it is now all too clear that notwithstanding that duty some children were abused. The payment of public moneys as financial redress for abuse suffered in such cases is therefore appropriate. These considerations do not apply to day schools where public bodies did not have the kind of supervisory functions, powers or duties which applied in the residential institutions and the children themselves were resident with their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, one of the functions laid down in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, requires the commission to advise the Government on the actions that may be taken to alleviate the damage suffered by persons who were abused in childhood. The commission pro<Col N="394" /> cess, as I stated earlier, is open to all people who suffered abuse in childhood, except where the abuse occurred in a family home.</P>

      <P>A number of reports have recently been completed which outline the attrition levels at third level. A study of non-completion in undergraduate university courses was undertaken by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, at the request of the Higher Education Authority. The report found an overall non-completion rate of 16.8% for all first-time entrants to university undergraduate courses in the academic year 1992-93. The non-completion rates recorded by the report for each of the universities based on the 1992-93 cohort are as follows:</P>

    <P>The study also highlighted the differences in numbers of students completing courses by field of study. Computer studies was identified as the field of study with the highest non-completion rate, 26.9%, followed by science, 22.2%, and engineering-architecture, 19.6%. The lowest rate of non-completion was in law, 7.1%.</P>
    <P>At the request of my Department, the council of directors of institutes of technology also commissioned the ERC to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the institutes of technology. A study of non-completion in institute of technology courses examined the completion rates for first-time entrants to 11 institutes of technology in 1995. The study shows an overall non-completion rate of 42.61% across the institutes surveyed, as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> A similar pattern between the subjects was seen in the technological sector with computing, 50%, and engineering, 50.9%, having the highest non-completion rates.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology also conducted a similar study, the results of which reveal an overall non-completion rate of 39.46% for the 1994 cohort of full-time first year students.</P>
    <P>The need for qualitative research to be undertaken into the factors influencing non-completion is well recognised and the Educational Research Centre has been requested to undertake qualitative research in both the university and technological sectors to identify the underlying causes of non-completion with a view to developing and improving strategies to deal with the issue. I am committed to tackling the issue of non-completion in third-level education and have requested the Higher Education Authority and the council of directors to expedite the qualitative research.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, there is a range of strategies and measures in place to tackle non-completion at both national and institutional level. In the university sector, the Higher Education Authority allocated £400,000, 500,000, in 2000 for specific initiatives designed to improve retention rates. There will be further allocations in 2001 and 2002 for this initiative. The measures funded include development of mentoring and study skills programmes, counselling services for new entrants and information packs for schools. Other initiatives developed by universities include orientation programmes, life skills modules and the appointment of academic counsellors, access officers, school liaison officers and mature student officers. The quantitative study undertaken by the Educational Research Centre recommended that each university develop explicit policies on retention and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to review these policies.</P>
    <P>In the institute of technology sector, the council of directors has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on maximising success rates for students. The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector and the profile has been made available to all the institutes.</P>
    <P>Since 1999, additional funding has been provided for the technological sector to address the area of non-completion. This funding has supported the appointment of retention officers and schools liaison officers; provision of additional advisory services, including counselling, academic support and career guidance; the establishment of staff training seminars; upgrading of orientation programmes and the expansion of mentoring programmes.</P>

      <P>The uptake of science in the junior cycle has remained constant at just under 90% for a number of years. At leaving certificate level the uptake of biology was reasonably constant for many years but more recently has shown a decline. The uptake of the physical sciences has been in decline for many years, a situation that obtains in most developed countries It is the belief within my Department that the decline in participation rates in the physical sciences is a multifaceted problem. Curricular content at junior and leaving certificate levels, teaching, laboratory equipment and practical work, examination papers, parental influence, peer pressure, perceptions regarding points, awareness of career options and career aspirations and other social issues all impact on the uptake of these subjects.</P>
      <P>The complex interplay of these factors will doubtless vary from school to school. It is also worth noting that the trend observed in the uptake of the physical sciences in Ireland is mirrored internationally. Consequently, intervention in a meaningful way to arrest the trends in uptake in these subjects represents a major challenge, not only to my Department and to the post-primary and third level education sectors, but also to the industrial sector, which depends on a well educated population in these subject areas.</P>
      <P>I have undertaken the following steps to address the decline in the uptake of the sciences, particularly the physical sciences, at senior cycle.</P>
      <P>I have established a task force on the uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third levels. The brief of the task force is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. I await with interest the recommendations of the task force, which are expected early next year.</P>
      <P>Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for first examination in June 2002. A new biology syllabus will be introduced in September 2002 for first examination in June 2004. A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in the 2000 examination. New structures for the examination papers in leaving certificate physics and chemistry will be introduced for the first examination of the new syllabi in these subjects next June. These new structures build on improvements introduced in the ordinary level papers in these subjects over the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. An in-career development programme for teachers of biology has been put in place in the current school year. Additional grants for the purchase of laboratory equipment, <Col N="397" /> including ICT equipment, are being provided for schools.</P>
    <P>Schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project. An additional annual <i>per capita</i> grant of £10 is being provided for schools for pupils taking physical science subjects at leaving certificate level. A revised structure for the junior certificate science syllabus is under consideration by an NCCA course committee. This revision is giving particular attention to the physics and chemistry content of the course.</P>

      <P>In past years, psychological assessment of national school children, including those suspected of having dyslexia, has been the responsibility of psychologists employed by the health boards and by voluntary agencies under their aegis. However, the Government decided in early 1999 that my Department should take the lead role in the provision of educational psychological services to schools. In September 1999, my Department established the national educational psychological service agency, NEPS, with the remit of developing a service that would be available to all primary and post-primary schools. Whilst the NEPS keeps statistics on the reasons for referrals for psychological assessments, these are not available on a county by county basis. An important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. NEPS psychologists also provide a consultation service and, in many cases, rather than assessing individual children, will give advice to teachers on appropriate programmes and methodologies that will help to overcome learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>All post-primary schools and 158 primary schools in County Galway have access to the NEPS service. Children in schools not yet served by NEPS may be assessed by psychologists from the Western Health Board or from voluntary bodies under its aegis. I am not in a position to provide detailed information about the health board services. Pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists to the NEPS agency I have also made funding available in order that schools that do not yet have access to its service may commission psychological assessments from private practitioners.</P>

      <P>The figures sought by the Deputy are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The early retirement scheme for teachers is voluntary. It is open to teachers to apply for early retirement under three strands. Strand one is available to teachers who are experiencing professional difficulties. Strand two is available to teachers aged 55 or more who have difficulty in adapting to change, while strand three is available in the case of teachers who are surplus to requirements.</P>
      <P>Applications under strand one and strand two of the scheme are processed by an early retirement advisory committee &ndash; ERAC &ndash; which makes recommendations to my Department. ERAC has four members: an independent chairperson, one nominee of the teachers' unions, one nominee of the school management bodies and one member representing my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department determines applications under strand three by reference to the factual position regarding the staffing requirements of schools. <Col N="400" /> Retirements under strand one and strand three are subject to an overall quota, in aggregate, of 150 per year. Retirements under strand two are subject to an overall quota of 250 per year.</P>
    <P>The early retirement scheme is a pilot scheme. The Commission on Public Service Pensions in its final report, which was published earlier this year, recommended that the pilot scheme be continued for a further five years, at which time it should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The figures in the tabular statement for second level retirements cover secondary, community, comprehensive and VEC schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase of new school sites is underpinned by a thorough assessment of the need for new educational facilities at primary or post primary level in any given area. The process takes account of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the type and extent of existing school provision serving the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process, my Department monitors county development plans and area action plans and meets with local authorities as required to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments. An assessment is carried out of the likely implications of such developments in relation to the capacity of any existing schools and, where appropriate, the local authority is requested to reserve a site for educational <Col N="402" /> purposes. Such reservations may ultimately result in the acquisition of the site and the development of a school or schools.</P>
    <P>Where such development is considered necessary, arrangements are made by my Department to acquire the site. Purchase is subject to the availability of funding and the priority to be accorded to the project. In addition, my Department must be fully satisfied that a school's long-term viability is assured and permanent recognition must have been granted. In general, the property management section of the Office of Public Works acts as my Department's agent in that regard. However, the option is available for patrons to purchase sites, should they so wish.</P>
    <P>In most cases, schools must undergo a period of provisional recognition, during which the operation of the school and the growth of pupil numbers are monitored. During that period, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and the Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building.</P>
    <P>The patron must ensure that interim accommodation complies fully with local authority planning, building, fire and health and safety regulations. Such accommodation should also be in good repair, adequately furnished, have satisfactory sanitary facilities and be suitable for educational use. My Department grant aids the rental cost of such temporary accommodation at the rate of 75% for schools having provisional recognition and at the rate of 95% for schools with permanent recognition. These arrangements apply equally to schools under all categories of patronage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and following consultation with the chairperson of the commission, make a scheme whereby witnesses to the commission can be paid a reasonable amount in respect of their expenses. Under that section, I made a scheme relating to travelling and related expenses of witnesses which has been in practice since shortly after the setting up of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of legal expenses has been dealt with separately. In approaching this issue I have sought to ensure that witnesses to the commission will have reasonable support, at public expense, <Col N="403" /> from legal advisers without infringing the provisions of the Bill, which require that proceedings in the commission be as informal as possible in the circumstances. To date, four proposals have been put forward to deal with this issue, one by the commission itself. Each of these has been rejected by a group of solicitors representing a significant number of likely witnesses who allege abuse in childhood. The most recent scheme was made by me in May, following consultation with the commission, the Office of the Attorney General and a legal costs accountant. My Department and the Office of the Attorney General, in preparing a scheme for legal expenses, have sought the views of the solicitors concerned. They have refused to make anything other than a very limited input on the basis that their primary concern is the setting up of a scheme of compensation.</P>
    <P>The scheme for legal expenses made in May provides a fee for each item of work likely to arise in a case. The fees payable in any given case will depend on its complexity and can be up to £3,800 for a case which is heard in a day with an additional £1,500 for each subsequent day. In a more usual case lasting half a day the fees payable would be £2,500. In the circumstances I consider this scale of fees to be reasonable. However, I understand from correspondence with the commission that many of the solicitors representing potential witnesses claiming abuse are not satisfied with it. My Department and the Attorney General's Office are considering the matter further with a view to finding a resolution as soon as practicable.</P>

      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio for primary schools has been reduced from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 19.6 in the 2000-01 school year. The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the 2000-01 school year, the creation of an additional 350 posts under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for the 2001-02 school year and the granting of additional resource posts for children with special needs has further reduced the PTR. It is now projected that the PTR for the 2001-02 school year will be 19:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing schedule for primary schools is structured to ensure that all primary schools operate to an overall maximum class size of 30 pupils by reference to the enrolment on 30 September of the previous school year. An overall maximum class size of 29 operates for schools <Col N="404" /> designated as disadvantaged. A maximum class size of 20 operates for junior classes in the schools included in the urban dimension of the new scheme introduced by me last January, Giving Children an Even Break. A maximum class size of 15 applies in junior classes in urban schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.</P>
    <P>The organisation of classes within a school is a matter for the board of management of the school in consultation with the principal. The information regarding the number of infant classes with classes in excess of 30 pupils as requested by the Deputy is being compiled and will be forwarded directly to him.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is proposed to appoint an additional 550 primary teachers between the 2002-03 and 2003-04 school years. The appointment of these teachers will further reduce the PTR and class sizes including infants classes in primary schools.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the comprehensive survey of all primary schools, which was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000 at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. All primary schools were issued with a circular in April 2000, followed by a letter of invitation, a questionnaire and a further reminder to apply for inclusion in a package of supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage. Almost 75% of primary schools responded to the survey with completed survey questionnaires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which was launched by me in January this year. Over 2,300 primary schools are benefiting under the programme, based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. After the new programme was announced in January 2001, several schools contacted the ERC and-or my Department offering various explanations for their school's non-participation in the survey in 2000. In addition, between September 2000 and April 2001, the ERC received 44 late questionnaires from the original survey. These schools were not included in the new programme since <Col N="405" /> the processing of questionnaires was completed on 31 August 2000.</P>
    <P>In February 2001, following consideration of submissions received, it was decided that any school that made a case concerning the failure to return a questionnaire in 2000 should be given a second chance to complete a questionnaire. It was also decided that a further opportunity to participate in the survey should be given to schools that were designated as disadvantaged or were participating in Breaking the Cycle pilot project, even if these schools had not made a submission.</P>
    <P>In March 2001, the ERC invited all these schools to participate in the survey by completing a questionnaire. A total of 133 schools responded to the second round survey. The circumstances of 91 schools that submitted additional material was also examined by the Educational Research Centre as were the 44 late questionnaires from the original survey. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of these schools is currently under consideration. The schools will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Government has provided £95 million under the national development plan for a third level access fund to tackle disadvantage at third level. Last July I launched the report on access to third level education prepared by the group, which I set up in September 2000 to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of disadvantaged students, mature students and students with a disability at third level.</P>
      <P>The report is a landmark document which contains 78 recommendations. Responsibility for implementation of many of these recommendations lies with my Department. Some recommendations require action on the part of other Government Departments and their views on the relevant recommendations have been requested. On a wider level, the recommendations call for action on the part of third level institutions, schools and community and voluntary groups. My Department has, to date, initiated a number of measures aimed at implementing some of the main recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the launch of the action group in September 2000, I announced as an initial step, pending the findings of the group, the introduction of special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders in 2001. Recommendations relating to the criteria for the special rates of grant are set out in the action group's report and approval for payment of the special rates have <Col N="406" /> issued to the local authorities-VECs. The special rates, effective from the 2000-01 academic year, are £3,000 for students residing over 15 miles from the college attended and £1,200 for students residing less than 15 miles from the college attended. The local authorities and the vocational educational committees, which administer the standard maintenance grant schemes, assess candidates for the special rates of maintenance grants also.</P>
    <P>In September 2000 I also announced a millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of £1 million in 2001. The fund is intended to build on the experience of the support scheme for students from disadvantaged families, operated by the Northside Partnership, which assists students to participate in higher education. The action group's report sets out detailed recommendations on the criteria which should apply in the disbursement of the fund. Area Development Management Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, has accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. Guidelines have issued to the partnerships and completed applications were to be returned to ADM Limited by 12 November. Arrangements for assessing the applications, with the aim of disbursing the funding, are now well advanced. I am committed to progressing implementation of the group's recommendations as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the primary schools sports initiative which I launched earlier this year. This initiative will help to promote physical education and healthy lifestyles in primary schools. A pilot project is being developed in selected schools early in the new year. The purpose of the pilot project is to prepare the way for the roll out of the new primary school physical education syllabus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> I have established a task force chaired by the well known Dublin footballer, Charlie Redmond, to implement this initiative. I have also appointed a national sports co-ordinator and two assistant co-ordinators to work with the task force. This initiative, together with the revised primary curriculum, will enhance PE provision in our primary schools.</P>
    <P>I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools last year. Under the terms of this grant, all schools designated as disadvantaged and schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme receive an annual grant of £1,000 &ndash; 1,269.74 &ndash; per school while all other schools receive £500 &ndash; 634.87. Circular 28/00 that issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000 outlines specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. This year's grant, amounting to £1,858,000 &ndash; 2,359,173 &ndash; issued to all primary schools in March 2001.</P>
    <P>Of this amount, £133,500 &ndash; 169,510 &ndash; was paid to primary schools in County Galway. Taken together with the grant of £44,226 &ndash; 56,155 &ndash; paid to primary schools in County Galway last year, this brings the total amount of grants paid to primary schools in County Galway since the introduction of this scheme to £177,726 &ndash; 225,665.</P>
    <P>In June 1999, the Government directed that suitable provision be made for PE facilities when new second level schools are being planned or when existing schools are being extended. This initiative means that all new schools that have an enrolment in excess of 450 students qualify for a PE hall of 608 sq.m. Likewise, when an existing school does not have a PE hall, provision is made for a PE hall of 608 sq.m. This area refers to the floor area of the hall and does not take account of ancillary accommodation, which can add in excess of a further 200 sq.m. to the overall size of the facility.</P>
    <P>Schools that have an enrolment of between 200-449 students qualify for a PE hall of 406 sq.m. Ancillary accommodation can add a further 200 sq.m. of accommodation to this floor area, giving a total area in excess of 600 sq.m. The needs of smaller schools for PE facilities are assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>The needs of schools that do not have a PE hall and do not have a capital project in planning will be addressed by the development of generic PE hall templates, which are currently being prepared within the building unit of my Department. The templates will standardise the construction of PE halls at second level schools and will reduce the architectural planning processes considerably. The templates are being piloted in four schools initially and are expected to be available shortly. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that schools in County Galway will benefit from this initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principles which underpin the strategy set out in the White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, are, first, lifelong learning as a systemic approach &ndash; a holistic learner-centred flexible system providing for a continuum of service from early childhood through to and throughout adulthood; second, equality &ndash; targeting of measures to address inequalities arising from socio-economic status, ethnicity, disability and gender; and, third, inter-culturalism &ndash; celebrating and catering for diversity and meeting the learning challenges of different groups.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive range of policies and actions for the development of the adult education sector. There are over 80 recommendations which form part of a long-term strategy for ongoing development in the light of available resources. Progress is under way in areas where funding has been provided under the national development plan. For example, the national adult literacy strategy is progressing apace with the number of students increasing from 5,000 to 18,862 and with some 246,000 learners each week watching the new television series, &ldquo;Read Write Now 2&rdquo;. There have also been strategic developments in the quality of the service, with strengthened links with other agencies, greater flexibility, an expansion of options and venues, a nationally certified staff development programme, a quality framework and research on assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The back to education initiative, which provides for a major expansion of part-time options in further education, will come on stream at the end of the year with 4000 additional places. This will increase on a phased basis to 20,000 extra places per annum by the end of the 2006. Phases 1 and 2 of the development of an adult guidance service are under way, with a service now operational in 19 areas. The aim is to have a comprehensive national service in place by 2006. A review of the organisational, management, administrative, technical and ancillary support services for PLC courses is nearing completion. New arrangements have been introduced for schools to encourage the development of adult self-funded part-time courses, providing for posts of responsibility, a once-off grant scheme and for profit from fee income to be reinvested in adult learning.</P>
    <P>An educational equality initiative is up and running which addresses gaps in the system for disadvantaged groups and pilots new approaches with a view to mainstreaming. A feasibility study is under way for the development of a further education management information system which will enable the progress of specific groups, such as lone parents and travellers, for example, to be monitored over time. The report of the action group on access to third level education has been published and top up maintenance grants have been introduced for students most in need.</P>
    <P>The National Qualifications Authority and the Further and Higher Education and Training Awards Councils have been established on a statutory basis to provide a unified framework for the accreditation of all non-university vocational education and training at further and higher levels. This is a vitally important development which will assist in the longer term in enhancing quality and relevance, providing for streamlined progression pathways and for mechanisms for the accreditation of prior learning and work based learning.</P>
    <P>The policies in the White Paper, which have received widespread support from practitioners and social partner interests, will continue to be implemented on a phased basis in the light of the resources made available in the annual Estimates process.</P>

      <P>The target set out in the national development plan and the White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo; is that over the period 2000-2006, investment in adult literacy should increase to £73.6 million and that some 113,000 people should benefit from the service. At this stage, the number of participants availing of VEC adult literacy services has been increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 18,862 at present, and investment has been increased from a base of £850,000 in 1997 to £10.677 million in 2001. Key goals are to increase access, to strengthen quality, to increase the referral links with other agencies and to provide a continuum of provision from one to one learning to group tuition to progression to certified learning options.</P>
      <P>In countries where there has been systematic sustained investment over long periods in adult literacy, the trend is for literacy services to reach at most between 5% to 10% of the estimated numbers in need. This is why, in addition to the targets above, new ways are being developed to reach a wider audience in the privacy of their own homes, using radio and television for literacy tuition and awareness promotion. The TV series &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo; broadcast last year was a resounding success, attracting an average weekly audience of 155,000 people, the highest ever for an educational programme in Ireland. RTE agreed to broadcast the second series three times each week and the second series is being watched by some 246,000 viewers each week. The evaluation of the first series, published by the National Adult Literacy Agency, shows that there is a very large demand from independent learners to avail of help without joining a literacy scheme. Use of radio and TV enables them to do so and the initiatives are supported by free learner resource books and a freephone helpline manned by trained literacy tutors, provided by the National Adult Literacy Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these developments, a model of workplace literacy has been successfully piloted and a workplace literacy strategy group has been established by NALA to examine how this model can be mainstreamed. Research is also under way on the development of a systematic assessment framework for the literacy service which will pro<Col N="411" /> vide for an objective diagnosis of learner's needs and starting points, and enable their progress to be monitored in graduated steps, particularly at levels below national certification at FETAC/NCVA foundation level and junior certificate.</P>
    <P>When more data is available and more progress has been made in these areas, my Department will be able to review and set revised targets in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases the Deputy has raised in a previous parliamentary question, and again in this question, the background is that under trade mark law and practice, trade marks consisting exclusively of indications of geographical origin should not be registered. This is reflected in the Community Trade Mark Directive (89/104/EEC). Article 3.1(c) of this directive sets out that the following shall not be registered or if registered shall be liable to be declared invalid: trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, or the time of production of the goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of the goods or service.</P>
      <P>The Community Trade Mark Directive has been implemented in all member states of the EU and, therefore, represents a valid basis upon which to object to trade marks in Greece that can be considered to consist exclusively of indications of Irish origin. The reason for becoming involved in such a case is, as stated in my previous reply, to ensure that a single company does not obtain a monopolistic right to trade marks that are exclusively designations of Irish origin. Such a position would pertain irrespective of where in the island of Ireland the goods were produced. A trade mark owner is entitled to prevent competitors from using that trade mark or, indeed, signs similar to that trade mark and, if the trade mark consists exclusively of a geographical indication, other exporters from the territory in question would be disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The large number of companies that quite legitimately and effectively portray their Irish origins or Irish connections in their names or brands illustrate that it is possible to display and make use of the value of such connections without registering a trade mark exclusively indicative of Irish origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of trade marks that contain elements that are indicative of origin, but not exclusively so, under article 3.1(g) of the Com<Col N="413" /> munity Trade Mark Directive they should not be deceptive as to origin. For example, a trade mark consisting of a number of elements including the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; or a similar word, thereby giving the impression that the goods are Irish, should only be used in connection with goods that have a genuine link to the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would have some concerns, where a foreign company is involved, if a trade mark incorporating an element that suggested that produce was of Irish origin was registered, without restriction. I would be concerned that if such a trademark were registered without restriction, it might be used for produce from other countries.</P>
    <P>If the company in question in this case is prepared to give an undertaking to be noted on the Greek trade mark register to restrict the use of those trade marks found to contain, but not exclusively so, elements indicative of Irish origin to goods originating on the island of Ireland, then I would be able to confirm that my concerns based on article 3.1(g) of the Community Trade Mark Directive had been met. However, trade marks should conform to the requirements of article 3.1(c), which provides,<i> inter alia</i>, that they should not be exclusively indicative of origin. As outlined above, I am concerned that no company should obtain a monopolistic right to a trade mark which is exclusively indicative of Irish origin.</P>
    <P>In relation to this case, I was informed that the Greek company in question was using trade marks indicative of Irish origin on produce from outside the island of Ireland. The information was supplied to me by the Irish Dairy Board. However, as I outlined, the possibility that it could occur is the issue that needs to be addressed. If the company in question submits an application for my consent to use the shamrock as part of a trade mark to be used only in connection with goods originating on the island of Ireland, I would be happy to consider such an application.</P>

    <P>Enterprise Ireland's focus is on developing industry clusters in areas such as prepared con<Col N="414" /> sumer foods and specialised engineering and it is currently working with a number of new business start-ups. Two relatively new companies, Combi Lift Limited and Aisle Master Limited are already established in the area. Under Enterprise Ireland's remit, funding has also been approved for an enterprise centre in Ballybay and other enterprise centres are planned for the county. Community enterprise centres are also planned to assist new business start-ups.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has implemented a new strategy to benefit the entire Border region and, in particular, towns such as Monaghan. This new strategy involves an increased marketing focus. As part of this strategy, IDA has a 30 acre business park in Monaghan town.

    <P>The availability of an advance factory is also important.

This will be promoted through IDA Ireland's regional and overseas offices.</P>
    <P>The availability of suitably motivated and educated staff is a key element in attracting quality employment to the area and we want to ensure that relevant courses and training are provided. In this regard, recent developments in Dundalk IT and Regional Development Centre have strengthened the support service to local industry.

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the recent cutbacks in services by Aer Lingus and other airlines have been proportionately much greater in Shannon Airport than in any of the other airports; if her attention has further been drawn to the effect that this is having on industry and tourism in the west of Ireland; and the steps she is taking to restore a reasonable and necessary level of passenger and cargo services to and from Shannon Airport.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Aer Lingus announced a range of cutbacks as part of its survival plan to address the extremely difficult situation facing the company as a result of the dramatic downturn in the global aviation market. The cutbacks resulted in reductions in services across the Aer Lingus network, including termination of services to Newark, Baltimore and Stockholm and reductions on services to Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago, London, Amsterdam and Paris.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the current crisis does not respect or protect any particular region and services at all three State airports will share in the impact of the cutbacks. I regret that in addition to the necessary Aer Lingus cost saving measures, BA has also cancelled its Shannon-Gatwick services in addition to its Cork and Belfast service. I also regret the loss of the Delta Dublin-Shannon-JFK service, at least for the winter.</P>
      <P>I would expect that when the financial position of the airline improves and the aviation market recovers generally, Aer Lingus and, indeed, other airlines will again review opportunities for re-establishing services which have been lost out of our State airports, including Shannon. In this regard, I also very much welcome the recent announcement by Aer Rianta to extend its zero charges incentive scheme for airlines which launch new routes into Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports. In the case of Shannon and Cork, Aer Rianta extended the period for zero airport charges from three to four years and the company extended this scheme to Dublin Airport where no charges will apply to new routes for a period of three years. Aer Rianta will also provide marketing support for route development promotional activities.</P>
      <P>I have also stated previously on numerous occasions that Government policy on Shannon transatlantic services remains unchanged. The Government is committed to maintaining a viable Shannon Airport as well as a viable Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>Throughout the discussions on the reform of the sheepmeat regime, I have sought support for the fixed premium to be set at a level which ensures a reasonable income for Irish sheep producers and bears some relationship with the premium payable in other sectors.

I will be making our case on these issues once again at the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 20 November.</P>
      <P>During 2001 I have also sought to convince Commissioner Fischler and my colleagues in the Council of the validity of Ireland's case both at meetings of the Agriculture Council and in the internal discussions with other Ministers. In this context, I have discussed the reform of the sheepmeat regime with the Swedish, Spanish, Belgian and UK Ministers for Agriculture. My officials have also had ongoing discussions on the issue with their EU counterparts.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain-type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain-type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain-type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain-type ewes. However, <Col N="419" /> in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows:</P>

    <P>The person named was paid £581.25 on 25 September 2001 in respect of 12.22 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare and including an additional sum of £31.33 under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.

    <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first 10 hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval, it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that entitlement to the married persons tax credit and double rate bands is dependent on the residence position of the relevant married couple. Under Irish tax legislation, the residence position of a married couple is determined by examining the residence position of each spouse separately. For each spouse to be regarded as resident in Ireland for tax purposes, each spouse must spend 183 days or more in the State in a tax year, or spend 280 days or more in the State in the tax year and the previous tax year combined. Once an individual's residence position has been established it is then necessary to determine what allowances and reliefs are due in accordance with the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>In the case of individuals who take up employment in Ireland and are deemed resident in Ireland, and where his or her spouse is also resident in Ireland, and where the assessable spouse is assessable and chargeable to tax on the joint incomes of the couple, such individuals are entitled to the married persons tax credit and double rate bands.</P>
      <P>In the case of individuals who take up employment in Ireland and are deemed resident in Ireland but whose spouse is not resident in Ireland, and where the resident spouse is not assessable and chargeable in Ireland on the non-resident spouse's income, if any, such individuals are only entitled to the single person's tax credit and single rate bands.</P>
      <P>However, in practice, the Revenue Commissioners grant concessional treatment where the inspector is satisfied that the non-resident spouse has no income, and the earnings of the spouse working in Ireland are the couple's only source of income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, I decided to look at the whole area of tax relief for donations. At that time there were 13 different reliefs for donations to various bodies with widely differing qualifying conditions. Having considered the area carefully, I decided to simplify and rationalise various tax reliefs in this area.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, as you will be aware, in this year's Finance Act, I introduced a new scheme of tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to certain organisations. These include charities, first and second level schools and third level institutions including universities. For the short tax year 2001, the minimum donation that must be made to a qualifying body is £148 &ndash; 185. For the tax year 2002, the minimum donation will be £197 &ndash; 250.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements for allowing tax relief differ depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person on self-assessment or a company.</P>
      <P>In the case of PAYE taxpayers, the relief is given to the approved body to whom the donation is being made. For example, if an individual who pays income tax at the higher rate &ndash; 42% &ndash; gives a donation of £580, 737, to an approved body, the body will be deemed to have received £1,000 &ndash; 1,270 &ndash; less tax of £420 &ndash; 533. The approved body claims a refund of the £420 &ndash; 533 &ndash; from Revenue at the end of the tax year.</P>
      <P>In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis, the individual will claim the relief as a deduction against tax. Similarly, in the case of companies, they can claim the donation as a trading expense. There is therefore no grossing up arrangement as in the case of the PAYE taxpayer.</P>
      <P>As part of this simplification process, most of the existing tax reliefs for donations, including covenants for the teaching of the natural sciences in schools, were allowed to lapse. I should point out that, in the case of covenants to second level schools, while there was no minimum amount, these donations could only be used for the teaching of the natural sciences. The new scheme has no such restriction. Furthermore, there is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated and, as indicated earlier, the tax relief is available at an individual's marginal rate of tax. It is also noteworthy that donations can be cumulative over a tax period and thus a weekly donation of, for example, £4 &ndash; 5 &ndash; would qualify.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would point out that during the passage of the Finance Bill this year through Dáil Éireann, I introduced an amendment which reduced the minimum contribution under the scheme. Overall, the new scheme represents a significant and generous improvement on the various reliefs which it replaced. I have, however, noted the Deputy's concerns in this matter and will bear them in mind in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax office records indicate that the taxpayer paid the correct amount of income tax in the 2000-01 tax year, i.e. the year ended 5 April 2001. The inspector has sent a return of income form to the taxpayer. She should complete the form and return it to the inspector who will then be in a position to determine if a refund may be due.</P>
      <P>If the taxpayer considers that she may be due a refund of tax which she has paid in the current tax year, she should contact the inspector. To determine whether a refund may be due, the inspector will need information about her income, including social welfare income, if any, since 6 April, 2001.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, which provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive the mobility allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and the person must be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eligible people who do not benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme may avail of a mobility allowance up to a maximum of £90 &ndash; 114.28 &ndash; per month. Eligible people who benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme may avail of a mobility <Col N="425" /> allowance up to a maximum of £45.60 &ndash; 57.90 &ndash; per month.</P>
    <P>The motorised transport grant is a means tested payment administered by the health boards. It was introduced in 1968 by way of circular 7/68. The purpose of this allowance is to provide assistance to persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain or retain employment or to provide assistance to persons with a disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems.</P>
    <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the person to obtain or retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
    <P>Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases, the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who will drive this person to and from his or her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>The maximum motorised transport grant is currently £3,300 &ndash; 4,190.14 &ndash; with effect from 1 April 2001. Further information regarding the above schemes, including the appropriate application forms, are available from the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>The provision of health and personal social services, including personal assistance services, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Additional funding allocated to the health boards for the development of such services will be in the context of the total amount of funding allocated for the development of services in the physical and sensory disability sector. Other priorities for service developments in the sector will also be taken into consideration when allocating this funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office in 1997, just over £107 million &ndash; 135.86 million &ndash; has been allocated by the Government for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year I allocated an additional £12 million &ndash; 15.237 million &ndash; rising to £24 million &ndash; 30.474 million &ndash; in the year <Col N="426" /> 2002, for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. I decided that of this, £5 million &ndash; 6.349 million &ndash; rising to £10 million &ndash; 12.697 million &ndash; in the year 2002 will be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million &ndash; 3.174 million &ndash; with a full year cost of £6 million &ndash; 7.618 million &ndash; for personal assistance services. This means that over 2001-02, funding is being provided for an additional 312 personal assistants to provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million &ndash; 13.332 million &ndash; already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million &ndash; 26.03 million &ndash; ongoing funding is being made available for the home support services, including personal assistance services. I wish to assure the Deputy that providing the relevant support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible will remain one of my priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the national cancer forum established a sub-group to examine the provision of services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The sub-group was tasked with assessing the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the national breast cancer screening programme; the increase in the target population; the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening; and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.</P>
      <P>The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to the Minister on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services; and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
      <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought on how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
      <P>The sub-group considered that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
      <P>When I received the report of the sub-group, I established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group met Midland Health Board officials and clinicians following which the board considered the development of specialist breast disease services in its area.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board was allocated a sum of £500,000 this year for the development of symptomatic breast disease services in line with the recommendations of the report of the sub-group. The board has formulated detailed proposals for the development of services in its functional area, including services at Portlaoise General Hospital. These proposals have been the subject of consultations between my Department and the board, and my Department will be responding to the board shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with the board to ensure a comprehensive and <Col N="428" /> coherent approach to the development of services for symptomatic breast disease in the region.</P>

      <P>The maximum fine applying to the offence of illegally parking in a disabled persons parking bay provided for under the Road Traffic Acts is currently the general penalty of £150, 190. The determination of the actual fine to be imposed in each particular case is a matter for the courts. The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, provides for major increases in certain financial penalties for road traffic offences including an increase in the general penalty to £634 &ndash; 800.</P>
      <P>The offence of parking illegally in a disabled person's parking bay comes within the scope of the on the spot fines system and at present a £15, 19, on the spot fine is applicable to offenders who choose to pay to avoid court proceedings. The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, provides for the replacement of the current on the spot fines system by a fixed charge system. It is envisaged that a review of the current on the spot fine levels, including that relating to the offence referred to in the question, will take place in the context of the introduction of the fixed charge system following the enactment of the Bill.</P>

On 14 December 2000, Waterford County Council was notified that the Tramore ring road, phase 4, was among the 43 projects selected for funding under this programme. A sum of £675,000, 857,073, was allocated to the scheme in 2001. Phase 5 was not one of the projects selected for funding under this programme. However, it remains open to the council to prioritise this scheme for funding, when submitting applications under the EU co-financed specific improvement grant scheme for 2002. The deadline for the receipt of applications under this scheme is 23 November 2001. Allocations to local authorities under this and all other non-national road grant categories will be announced early in 2002.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development Regulations), a planning authority notifies my Department where it appears that there will be impacts on the archaeological heritage. This enables my Department to make comments or recommendations to the planning authority which are aimed at avoiding or mitigating any adverse impacts. In this particular case, my officials made a submission to the planning authority earlier this year. In that submission, they pointed out that it envisaged an extensive and potentially intrusive development that would have an impact on any archaeological remains that may exist close to specific locations along the route. Moreover, there was need to take account of the effect on a local ritual landscape. It was the view of my officials that sufficient attention had not been given to this aspect in the EIS, and it was recommended that the developer undertake further archaeological assessment of the route by a suitably qualified archaeologist to address the issue of visual impact, and to recommend possible screening or other remedial measures where possible.</P>
      <P>In the event, a revised methodology and amended EIS was presented to my officials by the EIS consultant. This was broadly in line with the recommendations contained in my Department's submission. Planning permission has since been granted and, given that the concerns of my Department have been addressed both through the updated proposals and the conditions attaching to the planning permission, my Department does not propose to take any further action. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that concerns that may exist about protection of the wider visual amenity fall to be adjudicated upon by the planning authority through the planning process. I would add, though, that reference in the accompanying documentation to landscapes in the Heritage Act, 1995, applies only to the role of the Heritage Council in proposing policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the former. As the Deputy will be aware, the planning process remains the appropriate forum for assessing impacts in regard to landscapes.</P>
      <P>Reference is also made by the Deputy in the accompanying documentation to the Valletta Convention. As a signatory to this convention, Ireland has stated its intention to comply with the convention and its agreed articles. It does so by ensuring that the necessary legislation and policies are in place to protect the archaeological heritage &ndash; principally through the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994, and to a lesser degree, through the Planning and Development Acts. I am satisfied that as far as the proposal in question is concerned, my Department has adhered to its obligations under the Valletta Convention.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>his plans to extend the existing statutory provisions regarding maternity leave to make provision for additional paid leave for mothers of premature infants who experience genuine health difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans to make any further extensions to maternity leave at present. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, maternity leave, which attracts payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs subject to satisfaction of certain PRSI contribution conditions, was extended from 14 weeks to 18 weeks by order signed on 8 February 2001. The period of unpaid maternity leave was also extended from four to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>The extension to maternity leave was on foot of the recommendations of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation. The report of the working group was published on 28 February 2001. Other recommendations of the working group remain to be implemented.</P>
      <P>These recommendations are to make the period of additional, unpaid, maternity leave reckonable for the same employment rights that apply during a period of parental leave, accrual of annual leave entitlement, seniority, increments etc.; provision for paid time off work for mothers to attend one complete set of ante-natal classes. Also provision for paid time off for fathers to attend the last two classes immediately prior to the birth; employers to provide employees who have recently given birth and are breast-feeding with either an adjustment of working hours or breast-feeding facilities to express breastmilk in the workplace in order to facilitate breast-feeding for four months after the birth. The provision of breast-feeding facilities will be subject to it not giving rise to cost, other than nominal cost, to the employer; subject to the agreement of the employer, a mother may transfer from additional, unpaid, maternity leave to sick leave. In such cases, the employee would forfeit her right to any additional, unpaid, maternity leave not taken at the date of the commencement of the sick leave; a mother may, subject to the agreement of the employer, split her maternity leave in the event of hospitalisation of her baby. The employee must however take at least 14 weeks maternity leave, at least four of which must be after the end of the week of confinement, before she can return to work.</P>
      <P>These outstanding recommendations in the report will require amendments to primary legislation and/or subsequent regulations. Heads of a Bill are being drafted in my Department at present.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, following a review of their requirements at Golden, they have recently decided that the most economical option is to refurbish the existing Garda station and official accommodation. Accordingly, the Office of Public Works has been requested to include this station on the list of works to be carried out to Garda properties.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, however, to indicate at this time when the necessary works will commence, as this will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of finance and other resources and on overall priorities in the Garda building programme. I can say, however, that in the meantime the external redecoration of the building will be undertaken as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peace commissioners are appointed under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924. The Office of Peace Commissioner is an honorary appointment and peace commissioners receive no <Col N="442" /> remuneration or compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services. An application for appointment may be submitted by a person who is interested in obtaining an appointment or a third party may submit a nomination in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment. Nominations are generally received from public representatives. A local Garda superintendent sometimes requests an appointment in a particular area in the public interest.</P>
    <P>There is no qualifying examination involved but appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in the local community. Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment.</P>
    <P>Civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an appointment, i.e. an <i>ex officio</i> appointment. Solicitors and persons employed in their offices and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their calling. The fact that an applicant or nominee may be suitable for appointment does not in itself provide any entitlement to appointment because appointments are made at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and having regard to the needs of particular areas.</P>
    <P>The above criteria are applied to the appointment of all peace commissioners, including the appointment of the peace commissioner to whom the Deputy refers in Question No. 129.</P>
    <P>Details of the number of peace commissioners appointed in each year since 1998 are as follows: 1998, 155; 1999, 129; 2000, 154; 2001 (to end October), 80.</P>
    <P>At present the powers and duties of peace commissioners consist primarily of the taking of statutory declarations; witnessing signatures on documents if same are required by various authorities; and signing certificates and orders under various Acts.</P>
    <P>Peace commissioners are also empowered to issue warrants to search premises. However, in practice applications for search warrants are normally made to the District Court.</P>

      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the gardaí are fully aware of the concerns associated with Hallowe'en celebrations and that each division in the Dublin metropolitan region prepared a plan for the policing of Hallowe'en 2001 as part of Operation Tombola. The operation had four main objectives: to provide a Garda presence to all sections of the community in the lead up to and during Hallowe'en 2001; to pay particular attention to off-licence outlets and licensed premises to prevent and detect abuse of liquor licensing laws; to liaise with local authorities to ensure that stockpiles of bonfire material were removed by the local authorities as a matter of urgency &ndash; I am informed that this proved very successful; and to have gardaí visit both primary and secondary schools to present a Hallowe'en safety package to pupils, which contained a video presentation and information on the dangers of fireworks.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that numerous searches of premises were carried out as part of Operation Tombola and that significant seizures were made. There were also significant &lsquo;on street' detections. For example, on 19 October 2001, £50,000 worth of fireworks, contained in a transit van and intended for supply to street traders, was intercepted in the Kevin Street area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed that five cases of criminal damage were reported to the Garda authorities in the DMR northern division and that <Col N="444" /> these are currently under investigation. I understand that these were the only serious incidents of criminal damage or public disorder reported over the Halloween period and that no other reports were received expressing serious inconvenience or distress.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that there was no slippage in law enforcement in the Dublin metropolitan region in the run up to and during Halloween this year. Divisional plans under Operation Tombola were successfully implemented, with any incidents that arose dealt with effectively and in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Garda authorities will conduct a review of Operation Tombola and intend to implement a similar operation next year.</P>

      <P>Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1347/2000, which applies in the member states of the European Union with the exception of Denmark, with effect from 1 March last, divorce decrees granted by the courts of the member state of the nationality of both spouses, or, if the state is the UK, the domicile of both spouses, are recognised here. The question of legislation to deal with recognition of divorce judgments given in countries outside the European Union in the future is being considered within my Department. I have no plans for legislation to retrospectively amend the rules which govern generally the recognition of foreign divorces.</P>

      <P>Legislative provisions prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to persons who have not attained 18 years of age come within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and are set out in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001, which entered into force on 1 August 2001. Further provisions relating to the sale, marketing and smoking of tobacco products, including the establishment of a Tobacco Control Agency, are set out in the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, which was published by the Minister for Health and Children in August 2001. I am informed by the Department of Health and Children that the introduction of an age card for the purchase of tobacco products it is not provided for under the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001.</P>
      <P>The principal legislative provisions relating to intoxicating liquor and persons under the age of 18 years are set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. In particular, section 31 of the 1988 Act provides that the holder of a licence shall not sell or deliver, or permit any person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18 years. It also provides that a licensee who contravenes these provisions is guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Section 40 of the 1988 Act provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may by regulations provide for the issue of an age card to those who have already attained 18 years of age and are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises. The national voluntary age card scheme which I introduced by way of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations, 1999, is designed to assist licensees in complying with the law. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists. In any proceedings against a licensee for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it is a defence to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced. Neither the 1988 Act nor the 1999 Regulations preclude the use of other forms of personal identification for proof of age purposes but I would encourage use of the age card wherever possible. Serious penalties, including temporary closure of a licensed premises can result where a licensee is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an under-age person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the current age card scheme, coupled with the substantial changes provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, is proving an effective deterrent against under-age drinking. However, I am keeping the scheme under continual review and in that context I have recently established a review group within my Department which, in consultation with the Garda, will examine the operation of the scheme with a view to identifying any defects coming to light and, if <Col N="446" /> necessary, make appropriate recommendations. I expect that this group will report to me by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Tourist Victim Support Service was established in 1994. It is based in Garda Headquarters, Harcourt Street, in offices provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is overseen by an advisory board, which includes representatives of the umbrella Victim Support organisation, the TVSS full-time co-ordinator, Bord Fáilte, Dublin Tourism, Dublin Corporation, the Irish Hotels Federation, Aer Rianta, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and other partners in the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>The service receives an annual grant of £15,000 from Bord Fáilte and not directly from my Department. The TVSS sent an application for increased funding to me last August, which was duly forwarded for consideration to Bord Fáilte who are, I understand, currently in discussion with the TVSS.</P>
      <P>The TVSS offers a service to tourists who are attacked, robbed or otherwise victimised while visiting Ireland. It has had just over 3,000 cases referred to it since its establishment in 1994. I welcome the fact that since 1999 there has been a gradual but steady reduction in the number of referrals.</P>
      <P>Larceny and theft from cars still account for the majority of the crimes against tourists while thankfully violent attacks, although still occurring, are decreasing. I was particularly heartened to hear of the overwhelming support for Guido Nasi, who was attacked in Fairview Park two years ago, and who made a return visit to Ireland this year. This support shows that Irish people have a particular aversion to attacks against tourists who are our guests and are determined to make every effort to counter crime against tourists.</P>
      <P>It falls as a duty on all of us to make our visitors feel welcome and safe here. We in Government are playing our part in relation to general security issues. I am aware that a number of organisations, in addition to Bord Fáilte, also make contributions to the TVSS. I know that the TVSS is now making a concerted effort to increase sponsorship. I call on the many tourism enterprises who avail of or have access to the referral service to also consider making a contribution to the funding of TVSS's activities.</P>

      <P>The Educational Research Centre has completed two comprehensive studies on the extent of non-completion in both the universities and the institutes of technology. These quantitative studies provide analyses of data on non-completion by institution, gender and field of study. A further similar study has also been carried out by the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Following these studies, I requested the Higher Education Authority to host a national seminar on course completion in higher education. This seminar was held in May and provided an opportunity to consider the issues and trends arising from the recent studies against international experience and from the students' perspective. The need for qualitative research to be undertaken into the factors influencing non-completion was highlighted at the seminar and the ERC has been requested to undertake qualitative research in both the university and technological sectors to identify the underlying causes of non-completion with a view to developing and improving strategies to deal with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, there is a range of strategies and measures in place to tackle non-completion at both national and institutional level. In the university sector, the Higher Education Authority allocated £400,000 or 500,000 in 2000 for specific <Col N="448" /> initiatives designed to improve retention rates. There will be further allocations in 2001 and 2002 for this initiative. The measures funded include development of mentoring and study skills programmes, counselling services for new entrants and information packs for schools. Other initiatives developed by universities include orientation programmes, life skills modules and the appointment of academic counsellors, access officers, school liaison officers and mature student officers. The quantitative study undertaken by the ERC recommended that each university develop explicit policies on retention and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to review these policies.</P>
    <P>In the institute of technology sector, the council of directors has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each Institute to focus on maximising success rates for students. The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector and the profile has been made available to all the institutes.</P>
    <P>Since 1999 additional funding has been provided to the technological sector to address the area of non-completion. This funding has supported the appointment of retention officers and schools liaison officers, provision of additional advisory services including counselling, academic support and career guidance, the establishment of staff training seminars, upgrading of orientation programmes and the expansion of mentoring programmes.</P>
    <P>I am committed to tackling the issue of non-completion in third level education and have requested the Higher Education Authority and the council of directors to expedite the qualitative research.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by school authorities in relation to increased insurance costs and related conditions, referred to by the Deputy. At primary level, schools running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools, including insurance costs. In the case of secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grants may be used for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the insurers of a number of secondary schools indicated to the management authorities of the schools that they should take certain specified action if they were to avoid an increase in their premia or an excess amount for which they would not be given insurance cover. In some cases the specified actions included work of a capital nature. The management authorities of the affected schools sought funding assistance from my Department towards the cost of the capital work. My Department has agreed to provide the assistance sought.</P>

The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the 2000-01 school year, the creation of an additional 350 posts under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for the 2001-02 school year and the granting of additional resource posts for children with special needs, has enabled me to further reduced the PTR.

      <P>The public service benchmarking body was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF. One of the essential features of the benchmarking process is that it will look at all key public service groups as part of one exercise and that there will be one comprehensive report covering all the grades involved. The public service benchmarking body has been asked to produce its report by 30 June 2002. This is six months earlier than had been envisaged during the PPF negotiations. It would not be practical to expect the body to report any earlier. It has been agreed between the Government and the public services committee of the ICTU that one quarter of any increase arising from the report will be implemented with effect from 1 December 2001.</P>
      <P>The pay terms of the PPF agreement were adjusted following the agreement reached between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in December 2000. This adjustment provided for a further 2% increase in basic pay with effect from 1 April 2001 and a once-off lump sum payment equal to 1% of basic pay to be implemented on 1 April 2002. The 2% due with effect from 1 April 2001 has already been paid to ASTI members and they will also benefit from the 1% lump sum payment on 1 April 2002. By 1 October next all teachers will have received 22.6% increase under the terms of the PPF together with the 1% lump sum. Any increase under the benchmarking process will be additional to this.</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application for grant aid towards the cost of a building project at the school in question. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes at the conclusion of the forthcoming budgetary process.</P>

Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers. In the 2000-01 academic year there were some 3,300 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of these programmes. There are no plans at present to provide any other types of courses. However, all aspects of primary teacher training are the subject of ongoing review between my Department and the colleges of education.</P>

      <P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level. School authorities have been advised regularly that textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. Textbooks have to be changed periodically, however, to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date. It is unavoidable therefore that some textbooks will become obsolete over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not have a figure for the cost of textbooks at primary or post-primary level. It would not be possible to give any accurate figure for the cost of textbooks per pupil due to the fact that there would be wide variations in costs at different class levels; costs would also vary between schools and depending on the subjects being taken. My Department operates a grants scheme towards the cost of providing <Col N="454" /> school textbooks for disadvantaged pupils in primary and post-primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a disadvantaged pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance misuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
    <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school textbooks. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents. The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for the successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>At primary level, schools which opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants to encourage schools to participate in such schemes. At post-primary level, seed capital to establish book loan-rental schemes has been provided since 1994 for disadvantaged schools which do not operate such a scheme and which give a commitment to arrange for such a scheme.  The intention is to provide specific financial support for the introduction or expansion of book rental schemes in individual schools on an annual basis, for a period of six years, or five years in the case of five year cycle schools. It is envisaged that schools which receive seed capital will be in a position to establish sustainable book loan-rental schemes, which after the initial special assistance, will operate on a self-financing basis; ongoing costs will be met by fee income which can be subsidised in the case of needy pupils from the general book grants scheme allocation. I would continue to urge all schools to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment, CE, schemes, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services for schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, 50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, 126.98, per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum. My Department recently issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of funding towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. The scheme provides grants for schools that are not directly linked to any objective pay scales. Therefore, the level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities which, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply <Col N="456" /> diverse arrangements for secretarial and caretaking services as resources permit. As the secretaries and caretakers are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</P>

      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people on long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over, but subject to specific conditions, namely, he or she, must qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants; total reckonable income, in the tax year to 5 April 2001, must not exceed £7,400; as at 1 April 2001, the applicant's spouse or partner must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments and be in receipt of full-rate qualified adult allowance, or similar entitlement, in respect of the applicant or the applicant, him or herself, must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments </P>
      <P>It is clear that, to target those most in need, the action group wished eligibility for the special rates of grant to be confined to students where family income comes from long-term social welfare payments or, alternatively, from specific schemes such as the community employment scheme.</P>
      <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their finan<Col N="457" /> cial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of science, mathematics as the educational foundation to the development of a high-skill, knowledge-based economy is recognised by this Government. Increasing participation rates at second and third levels in these subject areas, and in particular the physical sciences, is essential for our citizens to participate fully in a knowledge-based society as well as to support further economic development. In recognition of this a number of measures have been taken to support these subjects in the curriculum.</P>
      <P>The uptake of science in the junior cycle has remained constant at just under 90% for a number of years. At leaving certificate level the uptake of biology was reasonably constant for many years but more recently has shown a decline. The uptake of the physical sciences has been in decline for many years, a situation that obtains in most developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline in participation rates in the physical sciences is a multifaceted problem. Curricular content at junior and leaving certificate level, teaching, laboratory equipment and practical work, examination papers, parental influence, <Col N="458" /> peer pressure, perceptions regarding points, awareness of career options and career aspirations and other social issues all impact on the uptake of these subjects.</P>
    <P>The complex interplay of these factors will doubtless vary from school to school. It is also worth noting that the trend observed in the uptake of the physical sciences in Ireland is mirrored internationally. Consequently, intervention in a meaningful way to arrest the trends in uptake in these subjects represents a major challenge, not only to my Department and to the second and third level education sectors, but also to the industrial sector, which depends on a well-educated population in these subject areas.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken the following steps to address the decline in the uptake of the sciences, particularly the physical sciences, at senior cycle. I have established a task force on the uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third levels. The brief of the task force is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. I await with interest the recommendations of the task force, which are expected early next year.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the three year, £15 million, physical sciences initiative announced in March 1999 the following actions have and are been taken. Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for first examination in June 2002. A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in the 2000 examination. New structures for the examination papers in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry will be introduced for the first examination of the new syllabi in these subjects next June. These new structures build on improvements introduced in the ordinary level papers in these subjects over the last three years.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. Additional grants for the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment, are being provided to schools. Schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project.</P>
    <P>An additional annual<i> per capita</i> grant of £10 is being provided to schools for pupils taking physical science subjects at leaving certificate level. A revised structure for the junior certificate science syllabus is under consideration by an NCCA course committee. This revision is giving particular attention to the physics and chemistry content of the course. A new biology syllabus will be introduced in September 2002 for first examination in June 2004. An in-career development programme for teachers of biology has been put in place in the current school year to support the introduction of the new syllabus.</P>
    <P>The number of students studying mathematics in schools is not an immediate cause for concern. Although mathematics is not a compulsory sub<Col N="459" /> ject on the senior cycle curriculum, the reality is that both employers and third level institutions hold the subject in such high regard that it is treated as a core subject in schools. In 2001, according to the latest available figures 97% of leaving certificate candidates took mathematics. This figure does not include leaving certificate applied candidates all of whom study mathematical applications.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above, I am keen to promote mathematics and increase the numbers of candidates taking the subject, particularly at higher level.</P>
    <P>A revised syllabus at junior certificate level has been introduced and will be examined for the first time in 2003. The introduction of this syllabus is supported by a substantial programme of inservice for the teachers concerned. A major focus of this in-service is the promotion of a more student-centred and active-learning approach to mathematics, with a view to increasing student engagement with the subject and the development of a greater appreciation for mathematics. The use of calculators in the junior certificate examination will be permitted for the first time in 2003 and my Department will shortly issue detailed guidelines for schools on the use of calculators.</P>
    <P>Applied mathematics is also offered at leaving certificate level. The NCCA intends to initiate a review of that syllabus during the current academic year In recognition of the importance of this subject and following the review, appropriate measures will be put in place to support the introduction and success of the new syllabus.</P>
    <P>These measures, and measures which will be taken in due course, in response to the findings of the task force on the physical sciences will all contribute favourably to addressing the concerns raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997.

      <P>At primary level, the position is that, in Kill, the need for a 16 classroom school has been identified. However, the current school site does not have the capacity to cater for 16 classrooms and appropriate ancillary accommodation. Accordingly, the Office of Public Works has been asked by my Department to locate a suitable site in Kill for a new school. Pending the delivery of permanent accommodation, temporary accommodation will be provided as necessary to cope with immediate needs.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, Kill forms part of the Naas catchment area. Following an evaluation of post-primary school requirements in the area, building projects were approved for all three schools in the centre. The current status of these building projects is that the extension and refurbishment programme at St. Mary's College has been completed, while the building programme for Meánscoil Iognáid Rís is in architectural planning. The need to extend and refurbish St. Patrick's post-primary school has been agreed in principle with the school's management authority, County Kildare Vocational Education Committee. Further information is awaited from the VEC before this project can be progressed.</P>
      <P>A review of the accommodation requirements in St. Mary's College was requested by the school authorities and is currently being examined in my Department's planning section. The school will be advised of the outcome of this review in due course. It is envisaged that, when these projects are completed, there will be sufficient accommodation to meet future needs in Kill, at primary level and at post-primary level in the Naas catchment area.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions, (a) the higher education grants scheme, (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, and (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The statutory framework for higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The local authorities administer the schemes on behalf of my Department which reviews the schemes annually. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in excep<Col N="465" /> tional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The fund's objectives, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the fund's provision from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

The three teacher unions have indicated that they wish to have further discussions with my Department. These discussions will be facilitated and my officials will continue to meet with the teacher unions as necessary to clarify any aspects of the offer. It has been made clear that there will be no improvement to the core terms of the offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department established the national educational psychological service in September 1999. The number of psychologists to be assigned by NEPS to each area is based on recommendations contained in the report of the planning group for NEPS, 1998. On this basis, it is estimated that eight psychologists will ultimately be required to provide a service to all schools in Kildare.</P>
      <P>NEPS is organised in ten regions, roughly equivalent to the health board regions. County Kildare forms part of the eastern region, south-western area, which also includes part of Dublin city, west County Dublin and west County Wicklow. At present, nine psychologists provide a service to schools in the region. Of this number, the equivalent of approximately 2.4 psychologist posts are allocated to schools in County Kildare. The current staffing level allows NEPS to provide a service to all post-primary schools and to 29 primary schools, approximately 10,000 pupils. The management team in NEPS is aware that north Kildare is part of an area partnership scheme and that a number of the schools serve disadvantaged populations. North Kildare is, therefore, being given a high priority in the NEPS rollout plan.</P>
      <P>Twelve of the primary schools that currently have access to the NEPS service are located in the Naas, Leixlip, Celbridge area in north Kildare. As an additional service, a pilot project is being initiated in 26 schools in north-west Kildare, approximately 4,000 pupils, during the current school year. The purpose of the project is to introduce the NEPS service to the schools, conduct an assessment of needs with them and undertake some in-career development for teachers. It is proposed to offer the full NEPS service to these schools in the next school year.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the needs of children in schools that do not yet have access to the psychological service provided by NEPS. I have therefore recently made funding available to NEPS to allow such schools to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has drawn up and issued to all schools, including those in north Kildare, guidelines on how to avail of this scheme.</P>

Although NEPS is not yet in a position to offer a full psychological service to these schools, it is initiating a pilot project in the <Col N="467" /> area, approximately 4,000 pupils, during the current school year. The primary schools in the Allen area have also approached NEPS. I am not aware of other requests on behalf of schools in north Kildare, although requests are sent in to NEPS on a continuing basis by individual parents and teachers. All such requests are carefully examined and information contained in such letters is taken into account when planning the expansion of NEPS.</P>

Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
      <P>It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The fund's objectives, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the fund's provision from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>
