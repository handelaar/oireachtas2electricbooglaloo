    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The communications unit provides a comprehensive information service to Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments and alerts them to any problems which may arise in relation to their implementation. In this way Departments will be able to provide a better service to the public.</P>
      <P>The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. Throughout the day the unit provides Ministers and their Departments with a detailed and comprehensive service ensuring that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments. The unit is staffed by seven established civil servants, six of whom are seconded from other Departments. One member of the team is currently on maternity leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the communications unit to my Department has been £53,211 per year on average since its establishment in 1997. The total cost since its establishment is £266,053. This includes the initial start up costs such as office machinery, <Col N="466" /> telecommunications equipment and furniture. The bulk of the cost is salaries and shift allowances.</P>
    <P>The work of the unit ensures that Departments are eliminating the use of external companies and no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. It is conservatively estimated that in a full year the communications unit would save Departments something in the region of £110,000 to £120,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the work carried out by the communications unit seems to be monitoring the media. Does the monitoring extend to the speeches and interviews conducted by members of the Opposition parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information unit takes straight from news bulletins and a number of programmes and from newspapers, a factual account of what is said. It just logs factually what comes across and circulates that information. If a programme is relevant to a Department it will log, tape or communicate the exact content. The information as it is broadcast is transferred. Up to a few years ago that information was provided by news services and tape companies. Deputy Noonan will recall that each of those tapes, even back before we started, cost about £30. They just take what is on the airwaves and communicate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>To make it absolutely clear, is it the case that an interview like the one I did today after the 1 o'clock news would be monitored by the monitoring unit and either the Taoiseach's Department or another Department would be provided with a transcript of that as appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that, does the Taoiseach think it is proper that civil servants should be used in what is essentially political work in aiding Ministers to counteract the valid criticisms made by Opposition spokespersons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how they are aiding anyone in counteracting criticisms. They are disseminating information, which is in the broad newscasts and available to everybody, and communicating that to Departments and agencies in a swift and efficient way. They do not do anything more than that and it is absolutely proper that such information should be communicated in a cost-efficient way, not in the old costly way in which it was done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that when freedom of information requests were placed by the <i>Sunday Times</i> and by Fine Gael, they were turned down on the grounds that the activity of the communications unit was political rather than administrative, and that this defence by his Department was upheld by those who adjudicate on freedom of information requests? Therefore <Col N="467" /> we have now been told that, by definition, the work carried out by this unit is political, not administrative. I put it to the Taoiseach again that it is entirely inappropriate for civil servants to be retained by the Taoiseach on a cross-departmental basis to help him fight his political battles, this is unprecedented, it has not ever been done before and it is something at which the Comptroller and Auditor General should look if the Taoiseach is not prepared to reverse his decision. This is outrageous. The Taoiseach is using taxpayers' money to fight his political battles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely untrue. The Government of which Deputy Noonan was a Minister had these people in every Department and used the outside services to tape and communicate all this information at enormous cost to the taxpayers. The service was used on a day to day basis to produce all of these transcripts. It is now done efficiently in a non-political way, just taking what is the factual information and communicating that.</P>
      <P>I can see nothing wrong with that. I do not see it as a great political service but as a good news service. Taking the morning newspapers and providing a gist of the headlines or taking a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and providing a gist of the issues involved and communicating that across Departments is only using the information in the public domain and giving it in a cost-effective way. As a result, commercial companies, which clearly have lost a great deal of business they used get in the past, are not involved and it is done by a small group of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that the fact that, on his direction, the Department has refused to release information about the activities of this unit requested under the Freedom of Information Act proves that this is not normal administrative activity, and that the refusal was on the grounds that the activity was political. If it is all so above board, why not release it under the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they are doing all day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not doing so. The Taoiseach is doing what he always does, making speeches full of ambiguity and talking out of two sides of his mouth at the same time. I put it to the Taoiseach that this communications unit is also transferring information to the Fianna Fáil press office, there is a total tie-in between the dirty tricks department in the Fianna Fáil press office and this communication unit, and civil servants are being abused in a manner which&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should confine himself to questions not accusations. It is Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="468" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always find your advice helpful, a Cheann Comhairle, and I thank you for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Chair is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. I put it to the Taoiseach that this is an unprecedented abuse where civil servants are being used for political activity, that they are lined up with the Fianna Fáil press office and that if he does not do something about it I will refer this to the Comptroller and Auditor General. He is getting away with too much and he will not get away with this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, Deputy Noonan can refer to it wherever he likes. I do not see anything wrong with this. Departments have, in the past, brought in well paid outsiders in massive numerical strength to communicate information across, within and outside Departments. They used outside companies to obtain films, texts and profiles of all kinds of articles and magazines against the small number of low to middle grade civil servants communicating the daily news without any comment other than that contained on the airwaves and passing it around Departments. That, in my view, is efficient Government. The five or six units involved, rather than costing a great deal of money, result in substantial savings to the taxpayer. I will co-operate with anyone wishing to take a look at how this is done. I think it is an excellent way of doing business.</P>

      <P>A brief supplementary from Deputy Noonan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>If everything is above board to the extent that this unit is simply recording and transmitting factual information, why is the Taoiseach refusing to release any account of its activities under the Freedom of Information Act on the grounds that this is political activity and as a consequence is exempted from the provisions of that Act?</P>
      <P>There are over 70 people employed across Government Departments in press activities supplemented by the communications unit; PR companies, to the tune of £10 million annually, are also retained across these Departments and on top of that the Taoiseach is using this communications unit to supplement the activities of the Fianna Fáil press office. That is undemocratic, unprecedented, unjust and is a corruption of the system. The Taoiseach should put a stop to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what the Taoiseach said about his having no difficulty in making the operation of this administrative unit open to normal scrutiny and inquiry, can he confirm to the House that a request under the Freedom of Information Act, introduced by the rainbow Government, to inquire into the operations of this administrative unit would be complied with and would not be closed off on the grounds of it <Col N="469" /> being a political unit? Is that what the Taoiseach is now saying? Is he reversing his position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was involved in the implementation of the Act for which he is claiming credit he would know I have no involvement in its operation. There is an FOI officer in each Department. I make it a practice not to look at questions or replies in that regard. Some people would say if I did I might let half of it out but that is not the way the Act operates. The FOI officer in each Department is a statutory officer. They, under the codes set up across Departments under the Act, deal with the questions raised. I have no involvement in this area. Perhaps people thought, when the Act was being drafted, that it would be a good trick to manipulate it in this way. That is not being done by this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm to me and this House that he has contradicted himself here this afternoon in that the FOI officer has formed the view that the activities of this unit are political. The Taoiseach has attempted to suggest that it is merely administrative. Either one or other is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If telling Ministers and Ministers of State what was said on the 1 o'clock news &ndash; what court case was discussed, what weather forecast was given &ndash; is of great political benefit then my name must be Joe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is great at painting innocent pictures. I can imagine all these civil servants perusing the weather forecast so that the Taoiseach's much travelled Ministers know which day to go to the airport. The Taoiseach confirmed that the adjudicating officer in the Department assessed the request under the Freedom of Infor<Col N="470" /> mation Act and found that it was not in accordance with the Act on the grounds that the activity of the unit was political, not administrative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil servants are paid by the taxpayers to work for us all, although there is a belief in Fianna Fáil that they are paid to work for Fianna Fáil. It is undemocratic if the Government has six or seven civil servants paid full-time to assist it in its political activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Fianna Fáil press office has on occasions access to this information and that there is a straightforward political link between those paid out of the Fianna Fáil budget and those paid by the public purse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that. I hope members of the Fianna Fáil press office listen to the radio and read the newspapers. That is what they are paid to do. They have nothing to do with this service. For the umpteenth time I repeat that this office monitors and reports strictly what is on the news and in the newspapers on a daily basis. It issues reports in simple schedules about which everybody knows but which is a very useful service to Ministers, Ministers of State and departmental officials who do not have time to listen to radio all the time. When they are notified of something that is important to them they can communicate with their departmental press officers to contact the relevant programmes to disseminate information. This is an efficient way to do business and it uses no great technology other than employing the services of a handful of people to obtain and disseminate information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach should make this service available to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to this people across Departments used outside agencies to get paper cuttings, clippings and tapes. That was very costly. In 1996 it cost £30 to procure a tape of one of these programmes. I am not sure what the price would be today. The calculation of the savings is based on those 1996 figures. It if was based on 2001 figures it would be substantially more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that none of the information used by the Fianna Fáil press office to regularly hector RTE, especially, about the appearances of a small number of Members of this House is sourced from the communications unit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify one contradiction. I understand the independent freedom of information officer in the Taoiseach's Department decided that information would not be released because the function of this unit was political, yet in reply to a parliamentary question the Taoiseach has indicated that the function of the unit is not political. Does this indicate that the Taoiseach, having said the civil servant acted honestly and impartially in his reply to the House today, is totally dishonest? If he does not accept that what is his alternative explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The freedom of information officer is independent. A communication of the first five or six items on the 1 o'clock news today is not a political act and it does not advance the Government politically. To suggest otherwise is nonsensical. How is it political and how does it assist the political process to communicate what everybody would know if they had the time to listen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not refer to the point about dishonesty. There is another issue in relation to the communications aspect. Is the communication without comment or are comments of any kind added for anybody, including the Fianna Fáil press office when it gets it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following the results of the British general election, I wrote to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on Friday, 8 June and subsequently telephoned him to offer my congratulations on his victory. Subsequently, I met the Prime Minister on Thursday evening, 14 June, on the margins of the EU Council in Gothenburg where we reviewed in detail the current situation in Northern Ireland. Arising from this, we decided we would invite the three main pro-Agreement parties to meetings in London on 18 June. These meetings, which also included the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Reid, focused on finding a resolution to the outstanding issues in the implementation of the Agreement and we will follow up on these discussions in the days ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very difficult issues remain to be resolved. All sides need to stretch and to live up fully to their responsibilities. The Good Friday Agreement put in place a new partnership arrangement; now is <Col N="474" /> the time for all sides to show the fullest solidarity with their partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party fully supports the Taoiseach's efforts to find an amicable solution through negotiation to the four outstanding issues of major importance that divide parties in Northern Ireland. I reaffirm the call made by the Taoiseach that paramilitaries on both sides should move quickly towards decommissioning so that a political solution can be found in the next few weeks. Does the Taoiseach intend to proceed by way of bilateral discussions with the leaders of the main parties or will negotiations in the first instance be conducted at administrative level with a view to a plenary session of party leaders subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for his support since he took over the leadership of his party. We are in a difficult situation. The discussions yesterday showed to the two Governments the level of difficulty following the election. There was a sense yesterday that we would have liked to have been able to start from the point reached on 8 March or even 2 May. However, it was clear that even that would be difficult. I detected that, following the election, people's positions on all sides have polarised. My assumption in the House some weeks ago that we would pick up matters after the election and proceed from there is wishful thinking. However, we must try to get back to that position as best we can.</P>
      <P>I will meet the Secretary of State, Mr. Reid, tomorrow. After our meeting last night, the officials stayed on in London and they will return home tonight to brief me. We want to put together all the issues that were negotiated from 19 January to early May. I will discuss this with the Secretary of State, Mr. Reid, tomorrow. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Reid, will meet the other parties, including the DUP, over the next few days. I hope by Friday that, having met all the parties, the two Governments will have a good view of the position. We can then try to identify resolutions of some of the issues and ways to move things forward. That will not be easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's view that decommissioning is the lever which will unlock progress in respect of policing and the demilitarisation issue or does he envisage all issues moving in parallel without the decommissioning issue taking precedence over the others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always said, because it is the way these negotiations have proceeded, particularly since 19 January, that while none of these issues is related, we need progress on all of them to satisfy everybody. Initially, bilateral discussions are probably the best way to do that. At this stage a multi-party process of talks would <Col N="475" /> not prove successful and would not be a good idea.</P>
      <P>The British Government is anxious to deal with the many questions it has to answer on policing. We had moved a long way &ndash; even if it was privately &ndash; on the demilitarisation list but there was, and is, no possibility of bringing that issue to a conclusion without a clear position on decommissioning.</P>
      <P>The House will know my view on Mr. Trimble's position. He has been brave on these issues in recent years. His hands are tied in the absence of some stated progress on decommissioning. Without going into yesterday's comments blow by blow, I detect from what was said that he needs to see stronger action now than he did in the past. It is a difficult position.</P>
      <P>The SDLP is adamant that policing has to be completed in line with Patten and with results on the inquiries into the Finucane, Nelson and Hamill cases. Sinn Féin's position is that it has moved in a substantial way on all these issues and other issues still have to be addressed. It wants progress on these before it goes anywhere.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, progress on decommissioning would have to be very clear. A process with a vague timetable would not get us anywhere. I am confident that if we could get movement on policing, we could move on to deal with the demilitarisation issue which would help the decommissioning issue. However, I would be misleading the House if I reported that I noted any of those things yesterday because I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in inferring from the Taoiseach's comments that the progress made in negotiations at administrative and civil servant level on these four interconnected issues, contrary to expectations, has been somewhat reversed following the results of the election, that we now face a crisis because of the precarious political position of David Trimble and having seen how he was treated at his count, that David Trimble is serious about the action he says he will take at the end of this month and, therefore, that of the four interrelated issues, tangible movement on decommissioning is urgent not just for David Trimble but for the entire peace process?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my view that if councillor Martin Ferris thinks Prime Minister Blair should face down his generals to remove the apparatus of war from this country that Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Féin, should likewise face down his generals to remove the apparatus of war from this country to enable some process of decommissioning to commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Including Mr. Ferris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct in both questions. In answer to his first question, there is quite clearly a rolling back not just in the work at official level but also in our own work due to the election situation and the opinions <Col N="476" /> people have as a result of the election. The ground has tightened up for most if not all of the parties.</P>
      <P>The SDLP have been the most consistent always. They put an enormous effort into the policing issue. They welcomed the Patten Report with as much enthusiasm as did the Irish Government. They worked their way through the legislation, putting down hundreds of amendments which they debated and argued. They did not achieve all they wished but they certainly improved the legislation and have continued to press for more improvements. They supported the Patten Report, played their part in Patten and have given their support for its implementation. I will support their position on the Patten Report.</P>
      <P>The inquiries are a difficult issue and the trouble is there is more than one inquiry, SDLP inquiries and those on the Unionist side. Whenever there is a perceived veto or threat that is when you get least from Sinn Féin. That dilemma exists. Whatever the rights and wrongs, Mr. Trimble feels that he had to take that action in order to safeguard his own electoral position. A party leader has to take those types of decisions. It does not help the situation and I do not see any way out of it as far as he is concerned. He has indicated his position and his party's position and he has to face a party conference this weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who gained in the election were Sinn Féin and while we all have a role to play, they have the only role when it comes to decommissioning. If they were to help on decommissioning I could certainly mediate with the British Government in order to press for demilitarisation. It would greatly strengthen my hand also on the policing issue. The issues are not necessarily related but if nobody is prepared to move, then it is much more difficult to encourage the British Government to move on policing, on demilitarisation, and to encourage David Trimble to stay on. If nobody moves, then quite frankly, there is no point in negotiations because there will be nothing to negotiate. I appreciate the support of the House in this dilemma. I appeal to people to look at the situation. In terms of the recent election, the pro-Agreement side won, the advantages of devolution won. Northern Ireland is doing better now with less crime even though there still is some violence, the economy and the tourism industry are doing well and there is more investment. We are now facing the threat of all this being undone by Saturday week. That is the dilemma. I heard people yesterday saying that they could do nothing to help. Neither can I. I have no guns to decommission. I cannot demilitarise. I do not control the policing Bill but I know what will resolve it. If the people who have been through the elections are not prepared to do anything, then we are all wasting our time. That would be entirely unfair to the people of Northern Ireland, if not totally irresponsible. I hope people will reflect on what we are all saying. I am ready to play a part and do everything possible and I appreciate the support given by the <Col N="477" /> House. Valuable time is being lost as people just sit around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if the army council of the IRA were to issue a dump arms directive in line with historic precedent, would that be considered helpful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many ways. If decommissioning of arms was to equal surrender we would not ever see it. There are many ways of dealing with this issue such as the international commission on decommissioning, the legislation that both Governments passed and other modalities that have been debated. I did not ask anyone to adopt any agenda that has anything to do with surrender and I do not think anyone else has either, but if we could find either the historic precedent or some other way &ndash; I do not want to speculate but ways have been speculated outside of the House &ndash; it would help. Then we could make more progress. My concern and worry is that if everybody says &ldquo;that is not for us, we do not have to do this&rdquo; then we will not go anywhere. Whatever the wrongs and rights before the election everybody said it would come down to resolving four issues. Those issues include the stability of the institutions. I know Sinn Féin feels very strongly about those and that its two Ministers, Ms Bairbre de Brún and Mr. Martin McGuinness, have not been able to do their jobs in a complete way since the end of March. That is not satisfactory. Sinn Féin also believes it has done quite an amount on the arms issue by way of inspections. There is no doubt about that having been helpful but it is not enough. The SDLP has suffered a great deal over its position on a number of fronts and its wants progress on its agenda. Its agenda has only two issues &ndash; policing and the inquiries. The UUP requires the completion of the decommissioning issue and an end to violence. It would say that because decommissioning of arms has not been completed there is still violence. People have been killed and there are robberies and other incidents. It wants to see an end to that violence from wherever it comes and Sinn Féin wants to see the full implementation of the Agreement. I want to see the full implementation of the Agreement. Both Governments want it and everybody in the House wants to see it. Some 77% of the people in the North said they wanted full implementation of the Agreement in the election campaign. The point I am making is that if we want full implementation of the Agreement we have to have real negotiations in a sincere way where everybody tries to move as far as they can on all of the issues, and particularly the issues on which they have given a commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree there is provision in the decommissioning regulations for the paramilitary organisations to get rid of their own weaponry under the supervision of the international commission and that the question of sur<Col N="478" /> render does not arise? Will he agree that stripped of the smokescreens, the word spinning and everything else, the brutal fact is that unless there is clear progress on decommissioning the peace process is in serious difficulty? The main responsibility is on the republican movement to make that move which, if not satisfactory to David Trimble at least will be a clear move towards the commitments given by the republican movement. Will the Taoiseach agree given the evidence that sectarian tension and hatred are rising again to frightful proportions in Northern Ireland as illustrated recently by what has been happening in Larne and in other places, that this is a good reason anyone who purports to be in favour of the peace process should do whatever is necessary to guarantee its success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the one hand the guns being silent, the international inspections and the contact with the de Chastelain Commission are all helpful but they are not enough. On the other hand, at this time of the year the violence graph goes almost straight up. That is the dilemma around the commencement of the marching season. Clearly, anything that feeds into that is unhelpful. I know that Nationalist and republican homes have been attacked this weekend and there have been issues on the other side as well. Everybody suffers once these strains are there and that has happened in each of the last six or seven years.</P>
      <P>As always, I was at pains yesterday to stress that everybody appreciates the guns are silent. People also appreciate the inspectors' report and the contact with General de Chastelain, but that will not be enough to resolve the problem. I hope that we can still work on the position as per 6 May 2000. Following statements by the Government the previous day that I am committed to, there was agreement with the republican movement on that day to work to putting the arms beyond use in a verifiable way under General de Chastelain's commission and this should be done in a way that would give satisfaction to the public at large. They were not my words but those of the republican movement. We still have to get back to try to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four major issues, which are not related, but all will need to make substantive progress, otherwise in ten days time we will be in an intolerable position and then it will take an endless period of time to try to recover. I will not have another opportunity to take Question Time on Northern Ireland before the negotiations so I want to make clear the Government's understanding. There is no magic trick the governments can do or if there is I am not privy to it; it is not in the Irish Government's hands. If there is not a move things will go down on Saturday week. The First Minister would resign, the Deputy First Minister would have a decision to make and I think would probably resign. Then there would be a six week period of stalemate during the worst time of the year in the North following <Col N="479" /> which the Secretary of State, Mr. John Reid, would have to make a decision on an autumn election. People would go into an election and have to take up positions and there would be more polarisation and intransigence. It is hard to imagine the difficulty of trying to bring it back together again. Quite frankly, I do not think it is possible. The alternative is to sit down for ten days and spend as many hours as necessary to try to resolve it. That is the dilemma and in my view there is only one sensible way to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Taoiseach's comments that in the very short space of time that is left, the key issue is that of decommissioning? He, along with many others in this House, has clearly said to people who profess to be republicans, that nobody has been asked to surrender arms or concede defeat, but merely to put arms beyond use. They do not even need to put all arms beyond use, but to make some tangible concrete response to the political stalemate. I think the Taoiseach shares that analysis and if it is correct, can it be construed, in his opinion, that the decision of the army council, which is an integral part of the leadership of Sinn Féin, not to make some tangible concrete progress on decommissioning is not a military strategic decision but inherently a political one, the consequences of which would be to lead to the vista that he outlined in his reply where there would be a Northern Ireland Assembly election later this year with a much more polarised community than we have at the moment? Does the Taoiseach agree with that analysis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the issues, but there are four issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Movement on one will create movement on the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn that if we do not get any progress on decommissioning, I cannot see us being able to get progress on other issues. I stress that it is not anything to do with surrender. Deputy Currie asked me if it was my view that there are many ways of doing this; there are several.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody would be helpful in trying to construct a way which could not be interpreted as having anything to do with surrender, which will never happen and which would not resolve the situation anyhow. We certainly need progress on that issue. We are simply trying to implement what was agreed on 6 May last year. If we can get help in progressing that issue, the Irish Government's position is that we will do everything we can to get the policing arrangements right. We will never resolve matters in Northern Ireland unless we get a police force that is acceptable and respected in every way across all sections of the community. We know what we have to achieve in this regard and we also have to deal with the issue <Col N="480" /> of demilitarisation. We cannot get progress on one issue without progress on the other. It is not realistic to expect to make progress on a number of areas and simply hope that the rest will fall into place. If people were prepared to move, it should not require a great deal of negotiation. We have already talked this issue to death and unless we can soon get some movement on it, the danger is that the whole process will be talked to death.</P>

        <b>:</b> Is it not a fact that all Sinn Féin is being asked to do is to honour a very clear and unequivocal undertaking which it gave a long time ago that there would be disarmament by a certain date? That is really all that has been asked. As Deputy Quinn has said, we are not talking of surrender, but rather a token whereby a small quantity of arms would be put beyond use. That symbolic gesture would have a dramatic effect in relation to reversing events which we hope will not happen in ten days time.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn, the current indications are that this situation will go on until the middle of next week and it would be useful if I could brief the party leaders at that stage. We need to focus on the full implementation of the Agreement. We know the areas which are holding up matters and the areas on which people can help to make progress, in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The current phase of discussions on the outstanding issues has continued from 19 January to 2 May. The situation now needs to be progressed further, as everybody had agreed to do. We always had a deadline of Drumcree Sunday, to which I have referred many times in the House and nothing which has happened in the election has changed that. I am aware of the date which Mr. Trimble has mentioned and that happens to coincide with Drumcree Sunday. Some people may not like deadlines but the reality is that if we are to complete what we have been trying to do in terms of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have an opportunity to do it over the next ten days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reports, to which the Deputy is referring, relate to our programme in Kilosa, in Tanzania. The facts are these. Our Head of Mission at our Embassy in Dar-es-Salaam was advised that our monitoring and accounting systems were indicating that an amount of funds provided to our area based programme in Kilosa in Tanzania was not properly accounted for. He ordered an independent investigation which verified insufficient accounting for some procurements and tenders, the total of which could reach £50,000. I should mention that our total programme in Tanzania this year is £13.5 million.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the results of the investigation, the Head of Mission went to Kilosa where he laid the information before a public session of the Kilosa District Council and demanded immediate action. His statement was picked up by the local media which presented it as the proper assertive approach for a donor friend of Tanzania to take. This was taken up in turn by the national media which took a similar line. This is the source of the information picked up in Ireland by a Sunday newspaper.</P>
      <P>The current position is that six senior local officials have been suspended and a police investigation has been initiated with a view to bringing charges against those suspected of corruption. The responsible Tanzanian Government Minister is engaged on the matter and determined to see a full and thorough investigation. Our main focus is to seek to have the funds properly accounted for. If funds are indeed proven to be missing, we also have the option of offsetting such an amount against further assistance. The important point to make is that our oversight systems do work, even in an environment like Kilosa where poverty and weak governance are features. The Deputy will, I think, further appreciate that, in pursuing this matter in so public a manner, we are determined to demonstrate not only that these systems work but that they are seen to work. However, the reality of development aid is that the environment in which all aid programmes operate is one where the issues of good governance and responsible public administration are themselves development issues. It is a fact that weakness in these areas is always present where there is poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within Ireland Aid every effort is made to put in place systems to guard against malfeasance. For example, in the six priority countries in Africa, where the greater part of bilateral assistance is concentrated, the six missions, together with all of the accounts under their control, are subject to annual external audit by reputable international accounting firms. Additionally, where there are area based programmes like those in Kilosa and sector support programmes <Col N="482" /> in the programmes in these priority countries, they too are subject to annual audit. There are qualified accounting staff in all the missions in the priority countries. In two of the countries where there are sizeable programmes there is a second accountant.</P>
    <P>Overall it is important to note that appropriate monitoring and accountability mechanisms are in place. The issues of governance and accountability are central to our dialogue with our partner governments in Africa and where incidents of this kind occur, proper action is taken, lessons are learned and new precedents set. We work closely on all issues of development co-operation, including accountability, with other bilateral and multilateral donors.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it clear that I am a strong supporter of Ireland's aid programme. I am also cognisant of the fact that the general public are major supporters and I want to see that support continuing. Does the Minister of State agree that, when problems arise, it is better to be transparent and open about them? Does she accept that it is better that the public be fully aware of the difficulties in Tanzania and the problems which have arisen in Ethiopia and in Uganda where a brother of the President seems to be looting the Congo? Does she agree that we, as aid donors to those countries, must take steps to ensure that our aid funds are not being siphoned off in any way and that precautions are put in place to ensure that our aid programme is not influenced or affected by the corruption which is everywhere &ndash; even the Government parties here had it &ndash; or at least that any effect will be absolutely minimal? </P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for his support of the Ireland Aid programme. I fully agree that we should be up front. The facts of this case demonstrate that it was our own internal audit, evaluation and monitoring systems which highlighted this alleged misappropriation of funds and have resulted in the dismissal of officials and a thorough investigation by the local Tanzanian authorities. As the Deputy has indicated, bad governance is not an issue which is peculiar to developing countries. Clearly, we do not dismiss out of hand concerns about governance in developing countries. It is part of the development agenda to work with those governments to build up their own capacity to govern in an efficient and accountable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within Ireland Aid, every effort is made to put in place systems to guard against malfeasance in respect of public moneys. For example, in the six priority countries in Africa where the greater part of our bilateral assistance is concentrated, the six missions, together with all the accounts under their control, are subject to annual external audit by reputable international accounting firms. Additionally, where there are area based programmes like those in Kilosa and sector support programmes in the country programmes in these <Col N="483" /> priority countries, they too are subject to annual audit. There are qualified accounting staff in all of the missions in the priority countries. In two of the countries where there are sizeable programmes, there is a second accountant. Overall it is important to note that our internal mechanisms, both in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin and at embassy level, provide appropriate monitoring and accountability for taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her response. Could I now look to the future to ensure that we will, I hope, have fewer problems? Are there any new systems or approaches which can be put in place to try and ensure that corrupt local politicians or corrupt local officials will not get their hands on aid funds? Is there a more direct way to ensure the funds flow directly to the people who really need them in so far as we can target the 12 million children under the age of five who die every year because of malnutrition? Has the Minister of State any ideas on a better way of aid delivery to try to avoid the snags and snares of corruption? Is there anything we can learn from other countries that have established aid programmes? I am thinking, in particular, of the Scandinavians who have a great track record in this regard. Is there anything we can learn from them which would be useful to us in the development of our aid programme? </P>

      <P>The issues of governance, corruption and accountability are central to our ongoing dialogue with our partner countries in Africa and they are frequently discussed by development Ministers. At the last meeting of development Ministers, we had a thorough discussion on this in relation to Uganda, for example. I understand there is a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Uganda where these issues have most recently arisen. In the context of the review of the overall programme, we will continue to put in place mechanisms commensurate with the expansion of the programme. The systems in place at the moment are under examination in the context of the review.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on such attitude and action as the Government proposes to take on the Security Council on foot of the report of the panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the United Nations panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo makes a number of <Col N="484" /> extremely serious allegations against countries involved in the DRC war. Rwanda and Uganda are singled out for particular criticism in relation to the looting and illegal exploitation of resources such as gold, diamonds, coltan and timber that has taken place in the DRC since the outbreak of war in 1998. The activities of Zimbabwe, the DRC and Burundi are also referred to in the report.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Security Council held an open meeting on 3 May last to consider the report and, following that meeting, decided to extend the mandate of the panel of experts for a further three months to enable it to update the report, assess progress made, undertake further analysis and follow up on the activities of countries and actors whose activities had not been addressed in depth in the report.</P>
      <P>Ireland supported the extension of the panel's mandate and expressed the hope that it would provide a fuller picture of the complexity and extent to which the exploitation of resources in the DRC contributes to sustaining the conflict in the region.</P>
      <P>The Government has expressed its concern at the serious nature of the allegations made in the report and has made clear its expectation that the relevant national authorities must thoroughly investigate the allegations and co-operate fully with the panel of experts in its future work. We, therefore, welcome Uganda's decision to establish an independent judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the allegations against it. That commission of inquiry has now begun its work under the chairmanship of a retired British born judge who has served on the Ugandan High Court. It will question all relevant witnesses, including President Museveni.</P>
      <P>The panel of experts is due to report back to the Security Council in August with an addendum to its report which will be carefully studied by the Government. If no progress is reflected in this addendum, the Security Council will consider the measures necessary to put an end to the illegal exploitation of the resources of the DRC. It is too early to prejudge what those measures might be but we will continue to work closely with other members of the Security Council to put an end to the illegal exploitation of the DRC's resources.</P>
      <P>We have consistently stressed the need to view the panel of experts report in the context of the wider efforts of the international community to end the DRC conflict. In the coming months, we expect progress by the parties on the implementation of the three core aspects of the Lusaka Agreement &ndash; withdrawal of all foreign troops from the DRC, the disarmament of armed groups and the holding of the national dialogue to provide for democratic governance in the DRC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The exploitation of natural resources to fuel war is not confined to the Great Lakes region. The mining and sale of conflict diamonds is also used to finance wars in Angola and Sierra Leone. <Col N="485" /> Ireland is working actively as a member of the Security Council, particularly as chair of the Angola Sanctions Committee and vice-chair of the Liberia Sanctions Committee, to tackle this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of requesting further information is rather like asking for the number of victims of a rapist. Does the Minister agree that the Congo has been raped? Does he agree that one of the neighbouring armed forces could have benefited in a period of 11 to 18 months to the extent of $250 million from the sale of coltan, gold, diamonds and timber? What action is being prepared by way of sanctions or otherwise on those countries that have been directly involved in the rape of the Congo? As the Minister acknowledges, the further investigation is establishing only the extent and degree.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister another question directly relevant to both him and the Minister for Finance. Uganda, one of the countries mentioned, is quoted as an example by the IMF and the World Bank on the basis of its economic performance which, it would appear, is boosted by the transfer on of material that has been looted from within its neighbour's borders. Are there not very serious questions in relation to the international financial institutions and their attitude to these countries which are effectively pillaging their neighbour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the view of the Security Council, having discussed this matter in open session on 3 May, to extend the mandate of the panel of experts to try to make sure that one could make greater progress beyond the allegations that were being made or whatever evidence there is to see what reaction one is going to get from those against whom allegations are being made. There has been progress in that regard in respect of the response of the Ugandan Government which is prepared to submit itself to the sort of examination envisaged by a High Court judge of that country and the fact that everyone, including the President, will be questioned on this matter. That is a very practical and important step. It does not suggest that is the full measure that will be decided on by the Security Council because it has said that within the next three months it will look to get further evidence, if there is further evidence, and to see what steps the national authorities are taking in the interim, some of whom are taking steps to address this question. Whether the response will be adequate remains to be seen. It is quite right that in August the Security Council will decide whether there has been an adequate response and, if there has not been and the allegations have been established to its satisfaction, what steps it will collectively take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Security Council is in such deep reflection, there are countries that sit with Ireland on the Security Council which are <Col N="486" /> customers for that which is being looted. Does the self-reflection and examination extend to that? The Minister might be well aware of who purchases coltan. I am not asking him to be well aware but he would have a good idea about where diamonds are sold. This information is known. Does the Security Council, in this interim before it returns to the topic, propose to place any sanction on those who are facilitating the looting of a country in Africa with 50 million people who are watching the resources of their country being stolen from them under threat of force? Their neighbour is regarded as an example of good governance and performance by two Bretton Woods institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the question of the exploitation of natural resources in the Africa region is not confined to the DRC. One sees the same happen in relation to the illicit trade in diamonds in Angola, and we chair the Angola Sanctions Committee. There is evidence of how the war in Sierra Leone was funded. The question of sanctions or otherwise have not been excluded in the considerations of the Security Council. Where it is established and if the response is not adequate, these options will be available to the Security Council. It has not finalised its consideration. The Deputy might be somewhat disappointed that those considerations are not finalised. It is in the process of dealing with the issue and of getting a response. Whether it is adequate remains to be seen. The wider issue of getting these armies from these countries out of that country is a very necessary prerequisite quite apart from what might have emerged from that report in making sure that the natural resources of the people do not continue to be exploited by others.</P>

      <P>We have served for almost six months on the UN Security Council and our experience has been positive and useful in terms of peacekeeping, disarmament, human rights and development aid.</P>
      <P>We have engaged fully and effectively on many regional issues. For example, with regard to Iraq, we have stressed consistently the need to work towards minimising the effects of the UN sanctions on the Iraqi people. The resolution to be passed between now and 4 July on the overhaul of the sanctions regime is an important step forward in what has been a long-standing issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Middle East, Ireland has been involved in constructive efforts on the Security Council, including the tabling of a draft resolution in March. Where circumstances such <Col N="487" /> as those in Afghanistan are concerned, we have been outspoken on human rights issues and humanitarian concerns. In discussions on UN operations, such as those in East Timor, we have brought our experience in UN peacekeeping to bear upon the issue.</P>
    <P>African issues comprise a large part of the UN Security Council's work. We have been active in efforts to further the difficult peace process, as has been mentioned in an earlier question on the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We participated in a successful Security Council mission to the region in May. Our permanent representative holds the chairmanship of the Angola Sanctions Committee and we have made a significant impact in ensuring that the UN sanctions against UNITA are implemented effectively.</P>
    <P>The Western Balkans, notably the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, have been a particular cause of concern in recent months and we participated actively in drafting a resolution aimed at restoring peace and stability to that region. In addition, our permanent representative has just returned from Kosovo, Serbia, as part of a SECCO fact finding mission.</P>
    <P>Against the backdrop of our long-standing experience in UN peacekeeping, we have taken a particular interest in the important issue of strengthening co-operation between the Security Council and the countries that contribute troops to UN missions. That work showed results last week in terms of the adoption of a resolution to this issue, which is an important step forward.</P>

I am cognisant of the huge political effort and input made to secure the seat on the council. I, and the public, want to be assured that it was a good investment in terms of our contribution to world affairs. Will the Minister tell us what he thinks has been the outstanding achievement to date? </P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the resolution on Iraq. In this regard, did Ireland take an independent stance or go along with the proposals that were made? What line did we take to ensure the sanctions would not have an impact on the general population of Iraq? There was much criticism of the US-UK initiative because it could make matters worse for the general population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong in thinking we are working on the UN Security Council for glory. It is a question of working for others to make a contribution to many seemingly intractable problems where national peace and security are at stake. The idea that, by our membership, we will automatically bring about a resolution to such problems is not sensible. Also, the council does not respect members who adopt a grandstand approach. We have to work with the people <Col N="488" /> concerned and adhere to the procedures of the council &ndash; regardless of our views on how it should be reformed or better employed in terms of its resources or how it could improve its relationship with the general assembly etc.</P>
      <P>I am informed on a weekly basis of the work being done. By its nature, it is painstaking, diplomatic work and takes place in the background. It is a matter of making sure our representatives are making our views known, and that they are doing so in accordance with the many foreign policy approaches that have been followed by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>I refute suggestions that Ireland is wasting its time on the UN Security Council. We are making an important contribution. We are acquiring levels of expertise that we would not have acquired were we not full-time members of the council. We are working assiduously with our colleagues and are seen to be constructive in every respect. They respect the fact that we make our case objectively. It has not ever been suggested that we are playing to anyone else's agenda. We are playing to the agenda that we were elected to adhere to &ndash; peacekeeping and promoting humanitarianism, as in Afghanistan. Where African problems are concerned, we have a strong standing among fellow members of the general assembly. They feel we keep them informed and assist in what are very difficult circumstances, not just political circumstances but those relative to poverty, AIDS and other serious developmental problems. Our contributions were consistent and detailed.</P>

      <P>I regret the delay that has occurred in the ratification of Protocol 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights. I assure the Deputy that it is the intention of the Government to complete the ratification process in the near future.</P>
      <P>The delay in completing the ratification process was due to the need to resolve a legal issue relating to Article 1(2) of the protocol, which required consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue involved concerns an inconsistency in deportation procedures between the provisions of Article 1(2) of the protocol and similar EU legislation as applied in Ireland under the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations, 1977, and the <Col N="489" /> European Communities (Right of Residence for Non-Economically Active Persons) Regulations, 1997. I have been advised that these regulations will be amended in the context of a future Immigration and Residence Bill. However, to enable Ireland to proceed immediately with the ratification of the protocol, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have to give an undertaking that, pending the amendment of the regulations, they will not be applied in a manner inconsistent with the protocol when it is ratified.</P>
    <P>I intend to submit a memorandum to the Government very soon seeking authority to ratify the protocol with a view to depositing the instrument of ratification in Strasbourg before the summer break.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

Can the Minister give assurance that the legislation which will be introduced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will not be narrower than Article 1(2) in the protocol? </P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated in his reply that aspects of EU law are inconsistent with the charter and that it is the charter's protection that will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform blocked it. This legal issue that arose was identified in our Department and referred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which sought the advice of the office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The issue is complex. Under the Immigration Act, 1999, which fully conforms to the provisions of Article 1(2) to Protocol 7, a non-EU citizen facing deportation is guaranteed more procedural safeguards than a EU citizen facing deportation under the corresponding European Community regulations of 1977 and 1997. Therefore, in certain circumstances, the EU citizen would be denied certain protections provided for by Article 1(2) of the protocol.</P>
      <P>The problem was identified at a late stage in the consideration of the ratification process and was felt to be serious enough to warrant referral to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to the office of the Attorney General. It was intended to have a protective instrument so EU citizens would not be disadvantaged. Pending that becoming part of a statutory provision, due within the next 12 months, an undertaking has to be given by the Department that its interpretation of the existing provisions will be in line with the protocol rather than a strict interpretation of the existing legislation, which seems to be inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Governments and parties are currently engaged in an intensive round of discussions to find an agreed basis on which outstanding elements of the Agreement are to be implemented.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday I met Secretary of State, John Reid, in Dublin and on Thursday the Taoiseach met Prime Minister Blair at the European Council in Gothenburg. Yesterday the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and I met the main pro-Agreement parties in London and we will follow up on these discussions in the days ahead.</P>
      <P>The election results highlight the urgent need for us to make progress now. Regardless of the imposition of deadlines or ultimatums, the arrangements under the Agreement cannot thrive unless we can put our difficulties behind us.</P>
      <P>The issues we need to address are well known &ndash; policing, demilitarisation, the operation of the institutions and decommissioning. We were able to make some progress before we broke for the elections and we are now seeking to take that work forward.</P>
      <P>While the House would not expect me to go into the detail of what is being discussed, Deputies will appreciate that our task is not an easy one. If we are to find a way forward, there are difficult decisions to be taken by all concerned. We will all have to be certain and clear about what is proposed. Commitments entered into will have to be honoured by all sides.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the majority of people in the North continue to want the Agreement, in all of its aspects, to work. They have seen their lives improve in a great many different ways and they know that the only way to sustain and to build on this is to see the Agreement fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government stands ready to do what it can. The parties must also act in good faith and each make its contribution to finding a way forward. We will continue our efforts to secure the remaining steps necessary to achieve the full implementation of the Agreement in the period <Col N="491" /> ahead and I thank the House for its continued support in this effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister was present in the House when the Taoiseach talked about the dreadful vista if agreement is not reached in the talks. Does the Minister agree that this dreadful vista will be avoided only if there is agreement on the one central issue, decommissioning, which is fundamental among all others at present? Does he agree there is one party, the republican movement, which has responsibility for movement in this area and that if there is not movement, that it will not be the fault of the British, the Unionists, this Government or the SDLP if this dreadful vista unfolds? </P>
      <P>As the question is related to the aftermath of the elections, does the Minister agree there is a strong argument for the introduction of proportional representation for Westminster elections in Northern Ireland? Does he agree that because Northern Ireland has been established as a place apart in the past because there is proportional representation for local elections, Assembly elections and European elections there is an unanswerable case for the introduction of that system for Westminster elections to avoid the tribal and sectarian divides which are encouraged as a result of the first past the post system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not profitable to predict the apportionment of blame game before we go into the details of these discussions. The reality is as the Deputy outlined in terms of aspects of the Agreement. Some have more responsibilities than others. I am not suggesting that we cannot find a way to resolve these problems. I acknowledge, however, the difficulties that are placed in our way at present because of a number of scenarios, including the outcome of the elections. To suggest there is a facile agreement available on the basis of one issue being dealt with is not correct. It will require efforts to be made by everybody concerned. Every party and both Governments will have to stretch to resolve this problem, but I acknowledge, as the Taoiseach did in his interaction with the Leaders of the Opposition earlier today, that the question of putting arms beyond use must move beyond contact with de Chastelain commission to effective engagement which will instil public confidence. That is the issue. How that will occur, or if it will occur in time to meet the political requirements of the situation as it is now unfolding, has yet to be determined. The Taoiseach was clear in his analysis of the situation and I do not wish to repeat what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first past the post system brings about more stark results than a proportional representation system. If the UUP got 1,200 extra votes in one constituency and 200 or fewer extra in another, everyone would have regarded the outcome as an outstanding achievement by the Ulster Unionist Party. The first past the post sys<Col N="492" /> tem by definition can, in a three way race, technically bring about, a 34% or 35% vote, which would provide a seat to the winner in that context. I would have no objection to the proportional representation system being extended to Westminster elections in Northern Ireland. Whether that would be possible, feasible or agreeable to a British Government is a matter for it to decide. I take the point that the PR system ends up with more representative results in that respect.</P>

      <Quest>the steps which are being taken to improve the conditions of employment for staff at Ireland Aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17792/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is inquiring mainly about staff at Ireland Aid who are on contract. As the Deputy is aware, the expanding official aid programme has posed two challenges &ndash; how to grow and how to manage that growth. Both challenges are being looked at by the group appointed to review the entire programme and to establish a reinvigorated policy and administrative base for that growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, there has been an appreciation that there are anomalies in the current organisation which needed a more immediate remedy. One of these is the situation of staff at home and abroad who are on contract. These, in the main, are development experts who work either as specialists at headquarters in particular sectors or who work in our embassies in Africa as programme <Col N="493" /> officers or regional sectoral specialists. Up to now they have been on relatively short contracts on fixed salaries.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that, following a submission of proposals to the Minister for Finance, there is agreement on a new regime for such staff which offers the prospect of an attractive career in the programme. The new arrangements will address issues of tenure through longer contracts, recognition of service through incremental scales and career movement through the introduction of a grading structure for specialist personnel. The new system will also address some aspects of an anomaly on pensions.</P>
    <P>This agreement was reached only at the end of last week following discussions which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, had with the Minister for Finance. Full details of how the new system will be implemented have still to be worked out, but I expect rapid progress now that agreement has been reached.</P>
    <P>In the context of the growing aid programme, these new arrangements are a most positive development which begin to bring our specialist staff in line with the employment conditions of many other donors and lay the foundation for building a corps of specialists vital to the management of the size of aid programme implicit in reaching the UN target for aid by 2007.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, the wider question of staffing for a growing programme will be addressed in the review. Some more pressing aspects, relating to the upgrading of the head of mission post in three of the diplomatic missions in Africa and the assignment of junior diplomatic posts to all six priority country missions are being addressed outside of that process and early progress is expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State make the detail of what she read available to us as it would be helpful?</P>
      <P>Does she agree that short-term contracts, which are the basis of my question, have been a major impediment to recruiting people of a certain calibre? Does she also agree that it does not make much sense to penalise those who wish to move from one agency to another or from one realm of experience to another to acquire rights of service in terms of a career and pension rights? I congratulate the Minister of State and the Minister on succeeding in their battle with the Department of Finance. The attitude of that Department to date has been singularly negative in facilitating the type of career structure which is required if the Department is to recruit people of the best calibre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we managed to divorce the issue of the contract staff from the wider aspects with which we will deal in the review of the programme. More flexibility is required in staffing arrangements if we are to grow efficiently with the expanded programme. The review is <Col N="494" /> examining that. I am told this matter did not take as long as have other matters of similar difficulty but I am glad that following the intervention of the Minister and discussions between him and Deputy McCreevy, this matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the individuals concerned. As we move towards expanding the programme, I hope it will provide a template for greater flexibility, mobility and career opportunities for contract staff so we will be able to attract a diverse range of expertise into the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that there is a dearth of staff in the development aid section of the Department, given the growth in the programmes? By 2004, when the budget will reach the target of 0.4%, the section will be handling a budget that is bigger than that of some individual Departments whose staff might be 200% to 300% more than the staffing complement in the Ireland Aid section. How many staff are in the section now and how many will be required to operate this scheme? Are there promotional opportunities for staff within the Ireland Aid programme so it does lose good people to promotion to other areas of the Department?</P>

      <P>Human resources is a key aspect of the review of the official aid programme. By 2007, the overall ODA budget will be £800 million which means the programme will have grown fourfold between now and then. Inevitably, that means we must put in place an appropriate level of expertise in terms of human resources, both in the Department and in the field, to manage the programme. We are examining those issues at present. If I recall correctly, there are 68 people in headquarters. However, it is a separate question and I will forward the information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Government remains seriously concerned by the continuing tragedy in Turkish prisons. Since I last replied to a question on this subject, on 9 May, a further prisoner has regrettably died. The Irish Ambassador to Turkey has raised the matter of the hunger strikers at the highest level, including with Foreign Minister Cem. He strongly reiterated the Government's appeal of 25 April to the Turkish Government to continue its efforts to address existing problems and to prevent further tragic loss of life. I also called on the prisoners and their representatives to participate as a matter of urgency in efforts to seek a solution.</P>
      <P>There has been some progress since I last responded to questions on this matter. The Turkish Parliament has passed several laws clearing the way for the implementation of the recommendations of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture. They include the introduction of civic committees to inspect living conditions in jails; the lifting of a ban on terrorist prisoners associating with their fellow prisoners in recreation areas; and the introduction of special judges to handle complaints about breaches of rules by jail authorities. The European Union has been actively involved in encouraging efforts to bring the hunger strikes to an end. EU representatives on the ground in Ankara are constantly in touch with the Turkish authorities. A European Parliament delegation, which recently visited several Turkish prisons, stated that it &ldquo;did not consider that there was sufficient reason to continue the death fasts, having seen the reality of the current conditions in two of the new F-type prisons&rdquo;. The delegation leader, Mr. Cohn Bendit, expressed his horror at the sanitary conditions in the old dormitory style prison accommodation and contrasted it sharply with the new F-type prisons.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless it is clear that some prisoners continue to have concerns about the new regime. A process of adaptation, explanation and confidence building is needed, addressing the need for communal activities, independent monitoring and examination of all complaints of ill-treatment and, where appropriate, the prosecution of state officials. These are issues on which we will continue to press the Turkish authorities in co-operation with our European Union partners. The Turkish Government has said it is committed to ending the hunger strike and I urge it to be active in winning the confidence of prisoners to establish dialogue and to prevent further tragic loss of life.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the position of those on hunger strike is now very serious in terms of the length of time they have been on hunger strike? Does he also agree it would have been useful if he and his colleagues in the EU sought permission for a genuinely inde<Col N="499" /> pendent group to visit the Turkish prisons, where in some cases, despite the new prisons to which the Minister referred, thousands of prisoners are being kept where there are places for only hundreds and given that he acknowledged that the sanitary and other conditions are primitive? What can be done in the short-term as we move past the crisis point for those on hunger strike? What is standing in the way of an independent group visiting the Turkish prisons to see the result of the new legislative regime on prisons, passed by the Turkish Parliament, and to examine other issues not yet addressed such as the elimination of torture? Can a report be prepared for the EU?</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the European Parliament delegation went for the purpose of providing more information to the EU and its institutions. As the Deputy has said, a total of 24 Turkish prisoners and sympathisers have died as of 15 June on a hunger strike which began in October last year. The hunger strikers are divided by themselves and by human rights NGOs into two groups, those who refuse to eat solid food but continue to consume sugared water and vitamin tablets and those who are described as being on a death fast. It is estimated there are 202 people on death fasts in 30 prisons with another 570 people on hunger strike in sympathy. Most of the striking prisoners have been convicted of offences under anti-terrorism legislation and are or are alleged to be members of extreme left wing groups. There is continuing tragic loss of life and we will continue to work with our colleagues to impress on the Turkish Government the necessity of getting rapport with the prisoners in a way that will bring this to a halt so their concerns might be addressed. There has been some progress in this regard, but it is clearly not yet sufficient to bring the terrible drama to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The growing level of dissent and disunity in the Cabinet about Europe is beginning to make the British Tory Party look united and cohesive. First out of the traps was the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and told everybody else to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. He was followed by his cousin, the Minister, Deputy de Valera, who expressed the view that the Irish people were against any further European integration. This was followed closely by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who pulled the rug from under the Taoiseach at a most sensitive time at Gothenburg. Yesterday the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources lambasted the Common Fisheries Policy quota which was actually negotiated by Fianna Fáil in 1972. Last night the Attorney General, a former Progressive Democrat, added his tuppence to the debate <Col N="503" /> when he called on himself in his official capacity to reform his own office in the processing of European directives for which he has one of the primary responsibilities. In view of the fiasco unravelling around the Taoiseach, would he take a grip on things, give leadership and ensure that he will have some credibility in Europe and that Ireland's role and influence will not continue to be damaged there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach could explain to the House the assurances which he gave, and indeed which his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, gave, to all of the applicant member states of the European Union that Ireland was committed to enlargement given that, in Gothenburg, his Minister for Finance was undermining him and flatly contradicting what was going on and, in Ireland, a procession of Ministers and Ministers of State were undermining the position of the Government with respect to the commitment on enlargement. How can other countries, whose relations with us are of particular importance, both for our economy and for employment here, take the Taoiseach's words seriously if he is being constantly undermined by colleagues in Government on a daily basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The full morning session with the European Council was taken up with a discussion on the vote in this country and we also had a separate session the following day with the applicant countries, where again we assured them of our position but explained to them, equally, that the Irish people had voted against the Treaty which was put to them. We explained that issue and clarified the issue in question and answer sessions, not only with the European Council and the applicant countries but also with the foreign media and with the applicant countries' media in particular, where I was asked by the applicant countries if I would answer questions put by their media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Government on this remains as I spelt out last Tuesday but perhaps I should state it again briefly. First, the Government fully respects the outcome of the refer<Col N="504" /> endum. Second, the Government is convinced that the people, in voting against the Treaty of Nice, were not voting against the European Union nor &ndash; more importantly, in this instance &ndash; against the enlargement of the European Union because that is what is at issue in Europe. I believe that at Gothenburg I succeeded in persuading our partners and the applicant countries of this. Third, the Government is firmly committed to the enlargement of the Union and it is the consensus view within the Union that ratification of the Nice Treaty is necessary for enlargement to proceed. That was clearly stressed at the weekend. I should say that the conclusion of Gothenburg is that all of the applicant countries, or those who fulfil the criteria, will present candidates in the 2004 European elections.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the referendum of course has created a difficulty for the European Union, for the applicant countries and for Ireland, and it is a difficulty which must be resolved. As I have said, we need to engage in a period of reflection on how to proceed. Our EU partners have indicated that they will offer whatever help they can.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Noonan said is entirely correct. If we do not deal with the enlargement process we will find ourselves in an extremely difficult position. I endured two difficult days last week explaining to the European Council and enlargement countries that this country is not against enlargement. We need to deal with the issues raised during the campaign. Many Members said they were in favour of enlargement during the debate in this House. I take people at their word. We have to, in a coherent manner, put forward a case which will convince the people to ratify the Nice treaty. We must look at that issue in conjunction with many others. We cannot make a decision in that regard until we have had a period of reflection on how best to deal with the issues involved. That will take some time. We must do this calmly.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that prior to the commencement of the council in Gothenburg two meetings took place, one held by the European People's Party and the other by the Party of European Socialists, at which six Prime Ministers in the Party of European Socialists and three with the Christian Democrats heard from myself and Deputy Noonan our support for the position which the Taoiseach subsequently carried successfully with the formal council meeting the following day? Would he agree that his position and the strategic importance not just for Ireland but for the whole of Europe in terms of enlargement and the ending of the historic division of this continent which has seen the ravages of fascism and communism for nearly 70 years, was deliberately undermined in Gothenburg by the Minister for Finance and that his attempts to paper over the crack between himself and his euro-sceptic Minister for Finance was formally repudiated by the spokeswoman for the Minister for Finance? </P>
      <P>If our Constitution still enshrines the principle of collective responsibility, when will the Taoiseach act in this regard? This is not a game between some members of Fianna Fáil, this is about the future of the European Union and the future of this country and its relationship to other European nations. The deliberate stirring up a conflict in Gothenburg by the Minister for Finance has had very negative results for us right across the continent, a conflict that has now been compounded by the Attorney General attempting to do as the Minister of State Deputy Ó Cuív did &ndash; private in part and yet having responsibility as Attorney General.</P>

      <P>I have looked very carefully at what the Minister for Finance had to say. Any fair reading of it will show he was referring to the fact that I had already stated we had to fully respect the outcome of the referendum. He made his support for the Nice Treaty and enlargement absolutely clear during his press conference. He made it absolutely clear that he believes the European model should be followed-through and debated. He also said there were some aspects which he believed, if they were pushed, could work against it. In that regard he mentioned the broad economic guidelines. His comments are on the record.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel Limited was formerly owned by the State who sold it in 1996. It then became known as Irish ISPAT Limited. Irish Steel was in a loss making situation at that time and its further viability was in serious doubt. It had run up serious debts and the workforce at the time was facing a bleak future. The plant was sold for the nominal consideration of £1 and, in addition, the State agreed to write-off accumulated debts of £17 million and to inject a total of £20 million cash into the enterprise. In return, Irish ISPAT gave the following commitments: (1) to maintain <Col N="517" /> the business of Irish Steel for a five year period at not less than the current level of production. This commitment was adhered to; (2) to invest £5 million for working capital which was completed in May 1996; (3) to employ an annual average of 300 permanent employees for a five year period up to 31 May 2001. There are over 400 employees in the workforce at present, a factor which in itself shows the commitment was adhered to; (4) a contribution of £2.36 million was included in the cash injection by the State for environmental works. I understand that up to last November, the company has spent £3.3 million on this work; (5) the company undertook to repay an outstanding loan of $14 million to the European Coal and Steel Community. That was repaid in 1999 and (6) the State had given a guarantee of £10 million of an ACC loan which had been taken out by Irish Steel. This loan is due for repayment in November 2003. My Department holds indemnities and a letter of credit in relation to this debt.</P>
    <P>My Department is keeping in close touch with the situation and the Tánaiste is seeking a meeting with the management of the parent company. The trade unions have had meetings with the management of the company recently, under the chairmanship of the Labour Relations Commission. I understand that another such meeting is planned to take place tomorrow. As Irish ISPAT Limited is a private company, I have no information on its debts or the possible impact on creditors. I know that a creditors' meeting is planned to take place on Thursday, 28 June. In the meantime, my fervent hope for all concerned, the workforce of over 400 and their dependants, the management of the company and the industries and suppliers which are dependent on this business, is that a solution can be worked out which will save it from closure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that it was known for some time that ISPAT was in some difficulty? When did he or his officials first become aware of these difficulties? Was he or any other Minister or Department contacted by ISPAT at any time regarding these difficulties? When did he or his Department first become aware of the decision to close? What kind of early warning system, if any, is in operation in the Department to alert Ministers and officials to potential problems in companies such as ISPAT? What action has been taken by the Department and Ministers to date to explore ways to keep the plant open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there was no direct contact from the company but there was contact in recent weeks with the unions concerned. Obviously the Government and everybody else would be aware that the cost of raw materials have increased considerably, that steel prices have decreased and that labour costs have increased recently. I have outlined in detail the history of this company which is a human tragedy for the area. Clearly the Government is conscious <Col N="518" /> of that. It is a private company. A meeting of creditors will take place at which all these issues need to be addressed. The Tánaiste will seek a meeting with the parent company. I express the Government's deep concern for the workers, many of whom have given a lifetime of service to this company, their families, Cobh and the surrounding areas. Every effort will be made to help. I accept it is a difficult situation. A great deal of investment was made by the Government when the crisis was dealt with on the last occasion. I note from the press statements by the company that the creditors are owed £36 million. The company says it has sufficient assets and property to meet its obligations. It also states that the pension fund is over-funded by £9 million. It has put some of the facts on the table as they emerged. My earnest hope is that there will be some progress on the issue when the unions sit down with management at the Labour Relations Commission. Later on there will be a meeting with creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the company contacted the Minister for Finance about the position in the past 12 months but there was no response. The Minister of State said there was no contact with the Government. There has been a great deal of media attention surrounding this plant both in terms of health and safety concerns and environmental issues. We were all aware of the necessary investment in the plant and that there were difficulties since the company's flotation in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have some environmental concerns. I understand a hazardous waste landfill or dump is being used by the company and a great deal of investment will be required to right the situation there. It is possible that there has been a leak into Cork harbour and, if so, considerable investment will be required to make it safe irrespective of whether the company leaves the area. Will the Minister of State ask the Tánaiste to ensure when negotiating with the company that the necessary investment from an environmental point of view will be part of the equation? In regard to the sale of land to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in the area by Irish Steel for £14 million and lands to Indaver, a company which was planning to build a waste incinerator in Ringaskiddy for £75 million, what is the position with that money now? Is it with ISPAT or has the State some call on it, in terms of the liquidation of the plant?</P>

      <P>I understand the site in question which was acquired in 1996 was sold for £3.5 million and that those funds were retained in the business to finance operations at Haulbowline. In regard to the waste, my understanding is that the Environmental Protection Agency was about to issue the company with a strict integrated pollution licence with regard to removing hazardous waste from the site. I give an undertaking that this matter will be pursued by the relevant Mini<Col N="519" /> ster, either in my Department or some other Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked a specific question about contacts and I will be glad to pursue that matter further with other Ministers for the Deputy. I replied in respect of my own Department. My information is that the unions contacted my Department.</P>

I will ask him one question only of those I had intended to put to the Tánaiste? It relates to her expression of optimism in Galway that this plant was not lost and that it could be kept open. What is the basis on which the Tánaiste made the assessment that the plant is viable and can be saved? That is a critically important issue for the region. Will the Minister of State agree it is not just a case of the 400 people directly employed in ISPAT but there may be more than 200 jobs involved in supply, ferry services etc. that are also at risk? Is he aware that the Tánaiste has also been trying to sell off IFI, the neighbouring plant, for some considerable time? It is a gloomy prognosis for the area. When the Minister of State said contact was made with his Department on behalf of the trade unions concerned, what action did he take arising from those representations? I presume contact was made with the company and it had a meeting with the company. Given the present situation the House wants to know exactly what actions the Minister took? Is that the basis of the optimism expressed by the Tánaiste?</P>

      <P>In relation to contacts from the trade union movement, my understanding is that it expressed its fears about the situation. That would not be uncommon as the Deputy will be aware from his involvement in this Department. This is a private company. In some situations there is not a great deal that can be done except to monitor the situation. The Tánaiste has expressed the hope, as I am doing here, that the situation can be addressed. The bottom line for the Government in any of these traumatic issues is that it affects a local area. The Deputy is correct in identifying the fact that it is not just 400 jobs that are involved but that 1,500 people may be involved in indirect employment. In any of these issues one will try to resolve the problem and save the jobs. That is the Government's ambition and that is why the Tánaiste is endeavouring to meet the management of the parent company.</P>

      <P>The train of events is that the LRC is involved and it is important that that process <Col N="520" /> be given every chance. The Tánaiste is endeavouring to meet the parent company, which is a strong international trading company. Everyone is clear about the loss making aspect that has presented itself, not just this year but on an annual basis. Up to £750,000 per month has been lost in each of the past few years. It is a loss making facility. That was the basis of the Tánaiste's comments and every effort will be made to help at this difficult time. There will be a creditors' meeting on, I think, 28 June. A series of meetings will take place in the coming days and we will try to save the plant. The facts as they are emerging make that look difficult. However, every effort will be made because of the needs of the workers and their commitment, as well as the impact on Cobh and the surrounding area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has indicated that, in the time preceding the announcement last Friday that ISPAT would close, his Department was contacted by union representatives to express concern over the future of the plant. Why did the Department not seek to speak to management or the parent company at that time? Why have we waited until after the announcement of the closure before seeking such a meeting? Surely this is a classic case of closing the door after the horse has bolted.</P>
      <P>We did not need union representatives to tell us that ISPAT was in difficulty. Because of his involvement in the plant, Deputy Dennehy knows better than most Deputies that ISPAT has been in difficulty, particularly in the past eight months, for environmental and financial reasons. It is unbelievable that the Department with responsibility for employment has not sought a meeting with management or the parent company to discuss the long-term future of ISPAT in Cork Harbour. That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>What has the Tánaiste been doing since the announcement and the very short notice that the workers were given? She was on Cork local radio this morning saying she was organising a meeting with the parent company for next Friday. We all understand the decisions are being made by the parent company. Has it responded yet? Will that meeting go ahead? I do not understand the time delay. If the Tánaiste was on local radio early this morning announcing her intention to have that meeting, why has she not got a response yet? Surely only a phone call is required. I would like to hear concrete proposals for the planned meeting on Friday. I am sure the Minister agrees we need to be somewhat restrained in what we say about the relationship between management and workers there because they are currently in very delicate negotiations. The workers have asked public representatives to refrain from making comments about that topic, so I will not pursue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there a contingency plan in place in the event of the closure of ISPAT? If there is not, one should be set up very quickly. There are 420 families relying on ISPAT for income. Many of the <Col N="521" /> employees have worked in the plant for 30 years. I had lunch yesterday with somebody who has worked there for 39 years. It is essential that we look at a contingency plan. I would envisage something like a forum on employment and an assessment of skills of the 420 staff so that other companies in the area could avail of those skills and there could be at least a next stage following the closure. Many of the workers do not know where to turn if the plant does not re-open. Those who have worked in the plant for a long time and have no experience of working anywhere else will need assistance from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Minister of State needs to show leadership in this. If the news about ISPAT re-opening is pessimistic this time next week, there should be a seminar, a forum or an assessment of skills to reassure the employees of ISPAT and their families without delay.</P>

      <P>On the question of contact at an official level within my Department, there was contact and fears were expressed by the unions in question. Their concerns were taken on board, but this is a private company. The company claims it is looking for savings, such as a 10% cut in wages, no further wage increases under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a 60% increase in production and they want to lay off 70 workers. It is a pretty tall order. On the other hand, clearly the unions are seeking information on the workers' future. As Deputy Coveney rightly acknowledges, there is a particular difficulty given the huge gap between both sides. The Department's role would be to help through the involvement of the Labour Relations Commission and that is happening.</P>
      <P>I have no further update on the meeting planned between the Tánaiste and the parent company except to confirm that we hope this will take place on Friday. I will keep the Deputies informed of developments in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney is correct in what he says about a contingency plan. We have to go through a number of stages first to try to find a resolution, but in the event of things going wrong with regard to the creditors' meeting etc., it is obvious that a major contingency plan would be required. I do not wish to envisage that now.</P>

      <P>In the event of a creditors' meeting taking place &ndash; which will only happen if discussions do not bring a positive result &ndash; an inter-company loan should not get precedence over local creditors. I ask the Minister to have the company law aspect checked. There is a large company loan on the balance sheet and that should not get preferential treatment over the local creditors.</P>
      <P>With regard to setting up a task force, I ask the Minister of State to check the outcome of the task force which was set up five years ago, when Irish Steel was sold to ISPAT. If there were any positive recommendations from that task force, it might provide a basis for setting up a forum, if that is the appropriate term, in the event of a negative outcome to the current discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Ahern that any investigations required will take place. With regard to loans, as I stated in my reply, the State gave a guarantee for £10 million in respect of a loan which had been taken out by Irish Steel from ACC Bank. That is due for repayment in 2003. The other important State-guaranteed loan was for $40 million, which has been paid back to the European Coal and Steel Community. The company also lodged £5 million in an escrow account, which is linked to the ACC loan. That is the background to the loans situation. The ACC loan is due in 2003 and we have to wait until then to see that matter brought to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The law provides for behaviour by companies and for any appropriate requirements and investigations. That will be pursued where necessary by the Government and the Department. Any experience from the previous task force to which Deputy Ahern referred will be availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to be cautious in our comments because the situation is still far from over and we must try to present a positive message. In his initial reply, the Minister of State outlined five or six commitments which had been entered into by the ISPAT company when pur<Col N="523" /> chasing the facility from the State in 1996. Does he consider that those commitments have been fulfilled to the level which they should be? Hopefully, his answer is &lsquo;Yes' and, if so, does he believe that the company has a commitment to the region, or at least did have such a commitment in 1996-97?</P>
      <P>In advance of the Tánaiste's meeting with the company in the next few days, has the Minister of State a full assessment from ISPAT on what are the actual problems? Will the Tánaiste be in a position to respond to a series of queries and concerns from the company? Is the picture fully available to the Department at this stage? While I am glad that a meeting is to take place with the company, I hope it will not be simply a discussion and that, in advance of the meeting, the Tánaiste will be fully appraised of the situation and the list of problems which the company is facing, so that she may be able to discuss possible solutions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed task force, even if ISPAT is enabled to continue in operation, the task force should look at the harbour region. The closure of ISPAT would be the thin end of the wedge. The present heavy industry is of a very old traditional type. The task force should be geared towards looking at new technology and new industry for this area. An area like Cobh and Cork Harbour cannot be expected to live on one traditional industry alone. The task force is essential in any event and hopefully the Tánaiste will be in a position to make progress when she meets the company.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister of State's assessment of the company's commitment to the region. This has been the subject of some debate but, from my own involvement in discussions in 1996, I feel there was a genuine commitment by the company to make a success of the former Irish Steel. It is unlikely that any company would invest in a facility simply in order to close it down five or six years later. Is there now a full picture of what has gone wrong and will the Tánaiste be in a position to discuss a solution, notwithstanding the fact that there is a difficulty with regard to EU prohibition on grant aid. We should look at all possible ways of assisting this company to remain in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that commitments which were made have been honoured. In my extensive reply, I mentioned employment levels, production levels and the indemnities and undertakings which ISPAT gave in respect of Government-guaranteed debts. All of those commitments have been honoured so far and, as I said, we have to wait until 2003 for a final assessment. I suggest that the problems have arisen from the fall in the price of steel, which involves international factors. As to whether the company's was genuine, I believe it was, in the sense that there was a clear plan when ISPAT became involved. The Government of the day and the then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, obviously <Col N="524" /> thought so too. The commitments by all concerned at the time were genuine. Our job now is to pick up the pieces. I accept the point that, whatever happens &ndash; and we must be as constructive as possible in our deliberations today &ndash; there is a need for a very focused approach to the area concerned. Whatever form it may take, we should let the unions and management deal with the next phase through the LRC. Regardless of the outcome, a very focused approach will be needed to help everybody through the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few questions for the Minister. In the effort to keep the company in operation, we need as much information as possible. Can Deputies be briefed on the details of the agreement made five years ago with ISPAT? There are many rumours in circulation. In particular, can we be briefed on the conditions with regard to future use of the land, especially on the island of Haulbowline which has probably one of the best graving docks in Europe? Can we have details of the commitments entered into by the company, other than the five year guarantee of jobs and the commitments regarding other aspects of expansion? The Minister of State has already mentioned the loans aspect; could we be briefed more fully on that? Is the Minister of State aware of the similarities between the recent request put to the workers in the plant and the 1995 agreement? The only real difference that I can see is that, at that time, there was no cut-back in wages. There was a three year pay freeze and 117 redundancies. However, it was accepted and worked through. Does the Minister of State believe this may be a ploy to try to get the best possible deal for the company? Is he enthusiastic that we can work out of that?</P>
      <P>I am sorry for being a bit long-winded but having spent 25 years building up the place as best I could, I would regret more than most the demise of this company. Some people seem to be anxious to see it close. Has any evaluation been done by the Department on the ancillary items that came up over the past couple of months, particularly in relation to the environmental difficulties the company faced and the claim in regard to the price of electricity, which is massive regardless of whether there were increases? I saw a bill 15 or more years ago which was for £0.25 million for one month's electricity. Has any evaluation been done by the Department on these other issues?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy has raised a number of relevant issues and I am conscious of his knowledge of the situation locally. I will arrange for a briefing for Deputies who are interested. Obviously, everybody here would be interested in being kept informed. That will be arranged for the local Deputies and for those who want an up to date briefing on all the issues referred to not only by Deputy Dennehy, but by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of loans was mentioned. I would be very happy if my officials briefed the Deputies in question on the loans. I mentioned the connec<Col N="525" /> tion between the ACC loan and the lodgement of the £5 million in escrow. That ACC loan is due to be repaid by 2003. I would be happy to arrange a briefing for the local Deputies as to what will happen if the loan is not repaid. That is important.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the environmental difficulties and the cost of electricity. They are very much related matters. I cannot really question the motivation of the company. I have answered the question in regard to the situation when ISPAT and the Government of the day sat down to try to save the situation in 1996. What I have said is on the record. I hope we can try to help the local situation and save the jobs in question. I thank Deputies for their contributions and I will be glad to provide briefing and an update for Deputies in the days ahead.</P>

What is his reaction to the notice the workers were given that their jobs were no longer in existence given these workers have mortgages and loans and families to rear? Is there any fund in the State that can assist these workers at this time? Can the Minister of State comment on the cost of ESB power to the plant which has been mentioned? Does the State have an allocation of a European or other such steel quota? If so, will the Minister of State make information about it available and state what will happen to it in the event of the plant closing? What will happen to the land on which the plant is located again in the unhappy event that the present talks do not succeed, although we all hope they do? What is the State's commitment? Are there any bonds or other guarantees? Are they held by the State in relation to the jobs and the continued operation of the steel plant? Were any such bonds or other guarantees held in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear we have established that no pre-emptive action was taken by Government in regard to the threat to a major employer in this region. I accept there is only so much any Government can do in the case of a private employer. However, does the Minister of State not agree that it is disappointing that no actions at all appear to have been taken either on foot of the trade union representations or from knowledge that over the past nine months the company was in some difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to one parcel of land being sold for £3.5 million. My understanding is that two parcels of land have been sold. What did the second parcel of land realise? What did the Minister of State mean by his reference to the pension scheme being oversubscribed? Why is it oversubscribed? Will it be a priority of the Minister of State and his officials to protect the pension entitlements of the workers, irrespective of the outcome? Is it the case that there is a separate deduction at source arrangement at the plant in terms of the payment of life assurance <Col N="526" /> policies, that these moneys are paid over quarterly and that there may be a question about them not having been paid over more recently? Will the Minister of State ensure that is taken care of as well? Although it was a long time objective of the Department to see this company privatised, I sincerely hope it has not forgotten about it entirely since it was privatised. Some people might think that was the case.</P>
    <P>In respect of the ACC loan, are the State and the bank indemnified, as the Minister of State said? Does that mean the ACC Bank is indemnified irrespective of what happens? As Deputy Stanton has said, we all hope the Tánaiste knew what she was talking about when she said in Galway that she was optimistic. However, is there an indemnity for the State in the event of it being needed? Is there a similar indemnity in respect of the $14 million loan to which the Minister adverted? Is it State guaranteed and, if it is, is there an indemnity?</P>
    <P>Can I take it that the Department will ensure that every communication and information system is put at the disposal of the trade union representatives and the workers in terms of their rights and entitlements should the worst come to the worst, because the Minister of State seemed to accept the proposition that if loans outstanding on the balance sheet are all discharged, as they should be in accordance with company law, that a very difficult situation for a number of local creditors will be created?</P>

      <P>In relation to the £40 million loan the State has guaranteed, do we have information on what that money was spent, that is, whether it was spent on capital investment or to repay loans in place under the former Irish Steel? The Minister of State did not really answer my question on why no contact was made before Friday with the management or the parent company. I accept this is a private company but it is one which has been propped up by the State as has been clearly pointed out today in relation to guaranteeing loans and so on.</P>
      <P>The State would have been within its rights over the past six months to ask genuine questions. Why did that not happen? There was prior warning coming from all sources &ndash; from environmental and financial sectors and from the unions.</P>

Were the losses to which the company is referring caused by market forces rather than the performance of the staff, which has given a dedicated service over many decades, not only to ISPAT, but also to Irish Steel? Is the figure of £5 million in losses correct? Is the Minister aware that the staff offered in the order of £2.8 million in cuts in wages, overtime rates, bonuses, etc. to help reduce those losses? Is the Minister optimistic or convinced that the company will do all in its power to retract the statement it made on Friday that it was closing, and does he think there is any chance the company will remain open?

      <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy O'Flynn, asked about the State guaranteeing £10 million on the ACC loan, which was taken out by Irish Steel. The Deputies questioned what sort of indemnities were in place. Deputy Rabbitte raised this first. My Department holds indemnit<Col N="528" /> ies and a letter of credit concerning the debt. In the event of that debt not being paid, the Department could immediately take the £5 million lodged in the escrow account. It is related to the loan due to be repaid in 2003. We are not in a position to know if it will, but I hope so. That money would be only a part of the moneys involved. The Department would have to take legal action to get the outstanding moneys.</P>
      <P>Issues were raised by Deputy Stanton and others regarding the position of workers. The company is obliged to give notice of lay-offs or make payments <i>in lieu</i>. There is a fund in my Department to pay outstanding sick pay, wages or minimum notices etc. in the event of a liquidation or receivership.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney referred to the contact between the Department and the unions. The only contact between the company, the Minister and the Tánaiste concerned the sale of a piece of land.

As the Act will have major implications for the industry, it is important that the structures put in place by the Act are effective and operable. I have a number of suggestions for the Bill, some of which I made before the suspension of the House last week. I hope the Minister has considered them for inclusion.</P>
      <P>Outdoor Education Ireland, among others, is the leading partner in the setting and implementation of safety standards and good work practices in adventure sports. This should be publicly acknowledged, and recognition should be afforded to the respective vocational education committees and the Department of Education and Science for their leadership. As I have said in the past, Cappanalea in County Kerry is one of the finest examples of an outdoor activity centre in Europe and is recognised as such. People come from Europe and beyond to see how it operates and to witness its good practices. It should be used as a model for all outdoor activity centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is proposed to exclude educational institutions and schools from the legislation, the outdoor education centres, as leading players in <Col N="529" /> adventure education, should be fully included in the licensing scheme and should act as a resource to the schools in the provision of safe adventure education programmes on the curriculum. Having read some of the contributions of other speakers, I noticed that Deputy Keaveney drew attention to the exclusion of the educational institutions and schools from the legislation. Will the Minister address this? </P>
    <P>Outdoor Education Ireland, the organisation responsible for outdoor public education centres should have a seat, by right, on the proposed authority. Similarly, the Chief Executive Officers' Association should have one, as a public provider of adventure education. Two of the four seats for providers on the authority should be dedicated to the public providers as they represent the largest sector in outdoor adventure-sport provision.</P>
    <P>Substantial, indirect costs for providers associated with the compliance of the agreed safety standards will be incurred by instruction, training, the need for enhanced qualifications, equipment investment and the renewal and upgrading of facilities. There should be no direct costs in terms of fees or charges associated with the licensing of providers. Those direct costs must be borne by the State as is the case with the Health and Safety Authority. No fees should be charged to providers. Will the Minister of State respond to this point? Substantial costs will be involved in upgrading such centres, providing retaining, improving equipment and so on. This will be a major imposition on the providers who in most cases do not make large profits. Activity centres generally pay their way and cover the costs of wages, but very few people involved in activity centres make big money. Most of them are sports enthusiasts who are involved as much for the love of the activity as for the money. If a major financial charge is imposed on the providers of activity centres, which will happen as a result of this Bill, the State should help them. The Minister of State might refer to that point.</P>
    <P>While there is scope for the authority to expand the list of prescribed activities, that list should be expanded from the outset to include raft building, of which I have some experience. This is a potentially high risk water based activity which is practised in most multi-activity adventure centres. While the more traditional adventure sports already have operational guidelines, raft building has no generic industry-wide safety guidelines. For that reason and in the interests of safety, I strongly recommend that raft building is included in the list of prescribed activities outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation. Activity centres will become more popular in the future. Many in the corporate sector book them for weekends for their employees to improve staff cohesion, to encourage co-operation among the workforce and a healthier lifestyle and to motivate employees. It is becoming a big business.</P>
    <P>Outdoor activity is becoming a big business in America and usually we follow what happens <Col N="530" /> there. Some major American corporations such as Boeing, Dupont, Johnson &amp; Johnson take employees to such centres for weekends or for a week at a time to work out and partake in vigorous activities. This will also become a trend here.</P>
    <P>It is also becoming popular for families to go to such centres. I am aware of families who go to Cappanalea and other outdoor activity centres for weekends. It is a great way for a family to bond and to increase understanding.</P>

It is important that it should be, as the practice that went on in the past led to the unfortunate accidents referred to earlier. We must ensure similar accidents do not happen in the future. What we are doing here is laying a framework for the future to ensure the safety of people who go to these centres.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for giving me the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill is most welcome and it is probably long overdue. A number of speakers mentioned the importance of outdoor education and adventure centres. A centre of particular interest to the Leas Cheann-Comhairle and myself is the Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre in County Monaghan near Cootehill, which is run by County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee. I hope it will be possible to ensure better co-ordination between the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Education and Science on the recognition of these centres and the promotion of activity, particularly outdoor sports.</P>
      <P>A matter that has been brought to the attention of public representatives from inland areas, in particular, are the difficulties arising from jet skiing on inland waterways. I refer in particular to parts of Lough Oughter in County Cavan. I would like jet skiing policed, as people who go angling, swimming or who take leisurely recreational activity on the waterways often complain to me about groups who jet ski and take over the waterways and prevent others from participating in other water based sports. I hope it will be possible to provide in the legislation for proper policing of that activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the forum, local authorities should be represented on it and rescue groups should have an input into the consultative process. This legislation has come about as a result of widespread consultation by the <Col N="531" /> Department at home and abroad. I am pleased that consultation took place over a wide-ranging area. The list of adventure activities is wide-ranging and some of the hitherto less popular activities have grown in popularity in recent years. Provision is rightly made to add or to delete particular disciplines.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the exclusion of schools from the provision of adventure activities and I hope the Minister will reconsider that. I hope it will be possible for schools to be included as providers. We have a good deal to learn from Great Britain and the North where adventure centres are plentiful and are in constant use by schools, particularly at second level. Valuable cross-community exchange visits take place between Fermanagh and Cavan and adventure centres seem to be a key area in providing the necessary facilities to enable such cross-Border co-operation to take place.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I would like the rescue services to be represented on the consultative forum. I hope the Minister of State will take into account the valuable role played by the rescue services and the local authorities in monitoring, providing and nurturing outdoor activities which are particularly relevant in inland counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this Bill. I was pleasantly surprised that so many Members had an interest in this area and I particularly commend Deputies Bell and Deenihan who sat through the entire debate. Deputy Connaughton also spent a good deal of time here. The contributions of Deputies on all sides were well researched and I assure them every idea they put forward this evening, including those put forward by Deputy Smith, will be considered. We on this side of the House, or my two excellent officials, do not have a monopoly on knowledge on this subject. Any idea that can improve this legislation and help reduce the incidences of death or injury will be most welcome and given strong consideration.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Bill did not become a political football. I commend the Minister, Deputy Fahey, on introducing it and I acknowledge the work of Deputy Finucane in bringing about its introduction. The Bill probably arose as a result of the efforts of Michael Davies, whose son Ros was lost in an accident near my home in County Wexford a few years ago. Michael Davies pursued this issue like a terrier, never letting go. Sometimes that focus is required to ensure legislation such as this is brought before the House. I hope his wish will be fulfilled when this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I attended the opening of a coastguard station in Youghal. It was commendable to see so many people involved in search and rescue activities, often at risk to their own lives. I also presented certificates to members of the RNLI. <Col N="532" /> One young man jumped into the sea at Rosslare and kept a person who had lost consciousness afloat until help could arrive. This young man, Michael Sinnott, put his own life in danger. I also presented an award to a 92 year old lady who has collected for the RNLI for 60 years.</P>
    <P>In Kilmore Quay I recently opened a memorial garden to commemorate approximately 1,000 people who had lost their lives at sea. Having seen the commitment involved in search and rescue activities around our coast, I am convinced that the Bill before the House is long overdue. If everybody used common sense, however, legislation would probably not be necessary. If only people intending to put out to sea would take a little advice. I always take opportunities such as this to remind people that a question that might seem embarrassing can often save a life. I have yet to go to a pier wall or harbour and not see some old fishermen sitting around. All one need do is ask these people for their advice as to whether it is wise to put to sea and so forth. The same applies to all sports. There are plenty of people who have expertise and experience. When one asks them a question, one might not get the answer one likes but one might get an answer that will save one's life.</P>
    <P>No Member of the House wishes to be a spoilsport. However, we are anxious to ensure that what begins as a day of fun for our constituents will end as a day of fun and will not end in tragedy, as we have seen occur far too often. Deputies will recall from the introductory remarks of the Minister, Deputy Fahey, that the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the enactment of a new legislative regime, by way of a statutory authority, to promote and enhance the safety of all persons, particularly young persons, who engage in adventure activities in adventure centres.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced as a result of the death of young Ros Davies and another young person. I have an intimate knowledge of that incident. The person who reported that people were missing and lost had made his way across Waterford harbour estuary to my local hostelry. Many a big ship did not make it across that estuary so his action required great bravery. The saddest element was that he told us &ndash; he was in bad condition himself when he reached home &ndash; the young boy was within 100 metres of his life being saved but, unfortunately, had caved in because they could not see the shoreline. When one hears at first hand about that incident, it is clear that the time has come to regulate these centres. It is time to apply common sense and if legislation is required to do that, so be it.</P>
    <P>The voluntary inspection schemes operated by the centre standards board of the Association for Adventure Sports and the Irish Sailing Association have served the participating part of the adventure activities sector well. It is clear, however, that a sizeable part of the sector has opted to remain outside the scheme and is not subject to any form of outside scrutiny. It is to be <Col N="533" /> expected that this part of the sector is of greater danger to public health and safety. There is, therefore, a need to establish a legal framework to place the entire sector on an equal footing and to provide for the safety requirements that a modern society demands.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the adventure activities standards authority is a key and innovative step designed to lead to the safer environment for all persons involved in adventure activities that is desired. I am confident that the mandatory registration of adventure activity operators and the mandatory requirement that operators abide by any codes of practice that the authority develops, along with the regulatory scheme for specified activities and the inspection scheme, will meet the required need for giving safety top priority.</P>
    <P>It is important that the statutory authority envisaged in this Bill should be set up as soon as possible and be charged with making proposals on all matters necessary to implement the regulatory and inspection scheme. The Minister and I are determined that every effort will be made to have the new statutory regime in place, in the sense of notifications and inspections, before the end of this year. It is also important that the authority, once established, should be able to conduct investigations into any accident or occurrence related to adventure activities, as this process will also serve to keep the authority up to date on particular risks or dangers in an adventure activity and allow it to amend its regulatory scheme or codes of practice to combat it.</P>
    <P>I took note of the many various points raised by Deputies and I will now deal with some of them. I understand the concerns expressed by Deputies Dukes and Bell in relation to the proposed authority being allowed to make charges for the provision of its services. The provisions of the Bill in this regard are similar to those contained in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 which allow the Health and Safety Authority to make such charges as it considers appropriate or necessary. By including such a provision in this Bill, the intention is that any charges to be made by the new authority would be designed to offset administration costs and would not be so prohibitive as to discourage operators from registering with the authority. I am certain no operator will feel the charges are too steep. I thank the Deputies for focusing attention on this issue.</P>
    <P>However, I accept the point that the Health and Safety Authority does not at present charge for its services. This principle and the Deputies' views on this matter will be considered when the new authority is established. The question of invoking such charges is being addressed in consultation with my Department. The real focus, which is safety in these centres, will be my focus when this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the definitions of adventure activities included in the Bill and questioned the absence of certain other activities from these definitions. Any issues raised <Col N="534" /> by the Deputies will be considered. In response to Deputy Smith, the issue of jet skis is to the forefront of the Minister's and my attention. I hope we can put regulations before the House in the near future which will meet with the Members' approval.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members who contributed to this debate. I particularly thank the Opposition for not making this Bill a political football. It is far too serious for that. I hope the work done this evening and before now on the Bill will help reduce the number of people injured or who lose their lives in activity centres.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>recognising the success of the national airline, Aer Lingus, the company's proud record of quality service since the airline was established 65 years ago and the importance of the national airline to an island nation, condemns the Minister for Public Enterprise for:&ndash;</P>
      <P>her failure to protect or promote the welfare of the company over the past four years;</P>
      <P>her failure to promote a positive industrial relations climate within the company;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> her total confusion and lack of vision as to the airline's role and future;</P>
    <P>her decision to allow the company to be sold by way of a trade sale;</P>
    <P>her failure to ensure that the Aer Lingus workers are made aware of the Government's intentions and calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P>abandon immediately any plans to sell off Aer Lingus by way of a trade sale; and</P>
    <P>make a clear statement as to what Government plans are for the future of the airline.</P>
    <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Owen and Donal Carey.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland have a very strong attachment to Aer Lingus. Over the past 65 years, since the company was set up in 1936, it has carried the flag and the symbol of Ireland throughout the world. It is truly part of what we are. For Irish citizens, and the millions of people of Irish ancestry, the Irish diaspora, who use Aer Lingus to fly to Ireland, it is true to say that once the seat-belt is secure, you feel as if you have already arrived home. Aer Lingus has an unrivalled safety record. It has a permanent place in our concept of Irishness. As an island nation, it is also important to have our own national air carrier.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus made £60 million profit in the year 2000 and it employs up on 6,000 staff. This makes all the more pathetic the current paralysis of thought or ideas on the part of the Government as to where exactly the airline is and what exactly is the airline's future. Two weeks ago the Minister for Public Enterprise delivered the ultimate insult to our proud national carrier when it was announced that she was considering selling off the airline in a trade sale. Small wonder that the trades union movement reacted angrily by dismissing the Minister's proposal as tantamount to a basement fire sale. When questioned about the trade sale in the Dáil last Tuesday, the Taoiseach was adamant that an IPO is still very much an option. Therefore, the Taoiseach favours one option, which is clearly not a realistic prospect if he took the trouble to look at the situation or to listen to, or examine, the expert advice for which the taxpayer has already paid more than £700,000, and on the other hand the Minister for Public Enterprise clearly favours putting the airline on the market and allowing the highest bidder take over one of the jewels of the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>No previous Government, and certainly no previous Minister, has ever shown such abject disinterest in the national airline as the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. For four years she has dithered while the airline has stumbled from crisis to crisis. In the past nine months alone, cabin crew have been on strike on more than one occasion. They closed the airline down on successive days, leaving 18,000 passengers stranded <Col N="536" /> and costing the airline £2 million per day. Despite this, the Minister stood idly by. When the clerical staff paralysed the company, grounding flights and costing £2 million each time things ground to a halt, the Minister again donned the garb of a disinterested spectator. Baggage handlers and caterers all took industrial action at different stages, each time impacting on the airline's services, and again the Minister washed her hands of it. In addition, the pilots lodged a 70% pay claim in pursuit of parity with their colleagues in the One World Alliance and Aer Lingus management, which is one of the most costly sectors, lodged their own individual salary pay claim. While an uneasy peace has descended on the airline for the present, one must be apprehensive about how long it will last because there does not seem to be any comprehensive overall inter-locking strategy or agreement in place.</P>
    <P>One also must be apprehensive of the fact that much of the disruption and industrial disharmony stems from competition within the airline between the two rival trades unions, IMPACT and SIPTU. I know of no other Minister, who has custody of one of the most important instruments of commercial life in a country, who has displayed such a manifest lack of concern as the company, which she controls and of which she is the major shareholder, was beset by such a myriad of problems as in the case of Aer Lingus. The Minister seems to have no clear focus and no vision of where the airline is going or what the airline's future should be.</P>
    <P>On 12 June 2000, the Aer Lingus Bill was published. The explanatory memorandum, which sets out the thrust of the Bill, states that the purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal framework to enable an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus Group plc to proceed. The Bill duly passed all Stages in the Seanad and since then it has been grounded.</P>
    <P>Each time we asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise if the IPO was to proceed, we were assured that this was still the intention once the industrial relations problems within the company were resolved. The reality is that the IPO has never been a realistic prospect for several compelling reasons. First, the credibility of this Government, particularly of this Minister, to manage the flotation of a further State utility has been irreparably damaged by the debacle of the Eircom flotation.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Some 500,000 small investors were duped by the Minister into investing their savings or borrowings in the mistaken belief that there was a guaranteed crock of gold waiting at the end of the rainbow to be claimed. The shares were over-priced and over-sold. To date the bulk of the half a million small share owners, who did not sell their shares, are left licking their wounds and searching in their empty pockets. In <Col N="537" /> spite of the proposed takeover by Valentia, the shares still languish at a pitifully derisory 1.27.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bloomberg index of European airline stocks has shown airline stocks to be consistently weak. Stocks have fallen 20% on average. Both Lufthansa and Swiss Air stocks have performed very poorly. Indeed, Swiss Air continues to struggle to remain solvent. Even British Airways shares continue to see-saw, and the same has been the story with Alitalia, Air France and KLM.</P>
      <P>However, perhaps the most relevant case history in this particular instance is that of Iberia. The Iberia experience should have taught the Government and Aer Lingus management that the IPO option is a rocky path, given the current market trends. The Spanish Government spent five years cutting costs and re-organising the airline to make it the second largest in Europe and one of Europe's most profitable carriers. Revenue is growing by almost 8% per annum. It is one of the most modern fleets among European carriers. In spite of this the Spanish Government was forced to cut the IPO price by 44%.</P>
      <P>Apart from the slow-down in the US economy and the impact of FMD, for the first time in a decade transatlantic passenger numbers have ceased their upward spiral. It is quite clear that the IPO option is not an option, certainly not for the foreseeable future. The Government should make a definitive statement to this effect and cut out the shilling each way tactics being played between the Taoiseach on the one hand and the Minister for Public Enterprise on the other.</P>
      <P>As regards the recently arrived trade sale announcement, the decision by the Minister to instruct her advisers, AIB and City Group, to search for buyers over the next month is absolutely ridiculous. The trade sale proposal should be debunked once and for all this evening. It is simply not on. A few months ago the value of Aer Lingus was conservatively being put at £500 million. Today, according to so-called informed Government sources, Aer Lingus is being valued at half that figure. Small wonder therefore that venture capitalists are lining up to pounce on the company if it is put up for sale. These should be more aptly named &lsquo;vulture' capitalists as there is every likelihood that they will pick the flesh off the Aer Lingus bones leaving a much slimmed down skeletal operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Selling off the airline to another airline company does nothing to guarantee the future of Aer Lingus. Indeed quite the reverse could well be the case. Take, for example, the current speculation that 49% of Aer Lingus could be bought by British Airways and that this would overcome the bilateral agreement between Ireland the US which stipulates that the majority shareholding in the airline must remain in Irish ownership. While this would undoubtedly be an attractive prospect for BA it would certainly mean cutbacks. BA will not require many of the existing Aer Lingus staff. In effect, we are talking about many redundancies and early retirement packages. There is the very <Col N="538" /> real prospect that Aer Lingus could well be reduced to a feeder airline merely feeding all transatlantic passengers through Heathrow.</P>
    <P>I am not saying Aer Lingus does not have problems. It has major problems. However, these problems should have been addressed as they arose. Had they been confronted and dealt with then the paralysis of vision or ideas would not have sparked off the Minister's panic measure of putting the company up for auction. Aer Lingus has a financial problem. While it made a profit of £60 million in 2000 it looks as if this will fall to £15 million in the current year. The company is under-capitalised with substantial debts and a debt to equity ratio that is much too high. It is over-politicised. One can see immediately that people like Paddy Wright and Des Richardson have little, if any, aviation experience. They are Aer Lingus board members simply and solely because they are cronies of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The company has also been very adversely affected by a lack of continuity of senior management personnel. There have been three chief executives within the past three years. The last two cost the taxpayer £700,000. So many chief executives in such a short space of time is serious and unacceptable. The Minister seems intent on replicating Olympic Airways which had 29 chairmen between 1975 and 1999 with an average job expectancy of ten months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> How can there be any clear and explicit direction or development strategy with such a senior management staff turnover? Management at Aer Lingus is bureaucratic and over-centralised. Decision-making is increasingly concentrated at the top of a sharply pyramidal management structure and staff with good ideas are afraid to make decisions. What is needed in Aer Lingus is stable professional management working to clearly defined business aims. New managers with experience of the commercial world, focused on reducing costs, improving labour productivity and industrial relations should be brought in. If Aer Lingus is to survive, change is a prerequisite for survival. Aer Lingus has to be made fighting fit again but the trade sale option or the IPO option are certainly not on. The first is not on in either the short or long-term. The IPO option is a possibility if the airline is rejuvenated, properly capitalised and invigorated.</P>
      <P>As regards the dismissal of former chief executive Michael Foley, the Minister's handling of the issue has been typical. The Minister parades herself around as the person taking credit for any success in the State sector and then stepping aside when the going gets rough. She left us with the clear impression initially that Michael Foley was hand picked by her yet she now disowns him completely just as she has almost disowned Aer Lingus by putting up the &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> Fine Gael is adamant that the Aer Lingus &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign should come down. The company has been one of the pillars around which this country has developed. It has stood the country in good stead over the years. It is still a very proud airline with an excellent track record. It deserves better than to be thrown to the commercial wolves. What it needs is encouragement, investment, management and vision. If it gets all four, I have no doubt that it will emerge from the tunnel, fit, willing and able to take on the best by playing its own unique strengths and availing of the commercial opportunities that undoubtedly will come its way.</P>

      <P>I wish to commend my colleague, Deputy Higgins, for tabling this important motion this evening.</P>
      <P>From the early, scary, exciting days of the foundation of the company, Aer Lingus has been part and parcel of our national being. Whenever Irish people travelling around the world see the shamrock on the tail of the Aer Lingus plane they feel a little bit of home.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as recently as February 1998, in a major speech on aviation policy in this House said:</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus Good Commercial Performance in Recent Years:</P>
      <P>Having successfully undertaken a major restructuring programme in the early 1990s, Aer Lingus has emerged stronger and better positioned to meet the challenges posed by the liberalisation and globalisation of the aviation industry. Consistent profits in recent years have demonstrated the extent of the turnaround in the underlying profitability of the company. This, from a company which only a few years ago had been faced with the worst financial crisis in its long history.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to talk about the sacrifices and implementation of the Cahill plan. That is what the Minister had to say in 1998. She is now giving the impression that she cannot fast enough get rid of this company from her hands, her Department and her responsibility. The Minister must take full responsibility for what has happened in Aer Lingus given what she had to say in 1998. We are tonight debating the selling off of Aer Lingus in a trade sale. I recently referred to it as a car boot sale. The value of Aer Lingus has already been peddled about as being less than the £500 million once quoted. It is now down to between £250 million and £300 million. No wonder, as Deputy Higgins said, people are sniffing around to see if they can achieve a cheap buy-out of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> As long as Fine Gael is around to stop the Minister's hand that will not happen. The 5,500 to 6,000 employees have given their lives to the development of this company. Many people in north Dublin lost their jobs or took redundancies when the Cahill plan was introduced in order to ensure the survival and growth of Aer Lingus. The Minister is the master of the disastrous situation facing us. As recently as 10 May the Minister, answering questions in the Dáil, expressed her commitment to implementing the Government's decision of 14 December in relation to the Aer Lingus IPO once the industrial relations issues were satisfactorily addressed. She went on to advise that the precise timing would be influenced by the conclusion of discussions on the shareholding for Aer Lingus employees, the enactment of the enabling legislation and market conditions. Despite this, she is today trying to suggest that the only solution to the Aer Lingus problems is a trade sale. Does she know what is happening to the companies under her aegis? Does she know what is happening in her Department? If so, how can it be that in such a short space of time, approximately three weeks after this advise to the House, she and the Taoiseach are giving conflicting messages about what is to happen to this company?</P>
    <P>I raised the issue with the Taoiseach and he told me that the legislation introduced in 2000 would be before the House before the end of this session. The Minister has not briefed the Taoiseach, otherwise he does not believe her or he is dumping her in it. Is the Taoiseach pretending that the IPO is the only option? This approach is not only unfair to Members, it is especially unfair to the employees of Aer Lingus, many of whom have given a lifetime of service to the company.</P>
    <P>There has been an upturn in Aer Lingus in recent years. The company had a profit of approximately £52 million in 1998 following an operating profit in 1997 which was diluted to a loss by share payments to staff. Nevertheless, there has been a steady increase in profits. The company has been attempting to adapt its package of products to the needs of today. The presence of Ryanair has helped to make the company more competitive and ensure that flight prices encourage people to use it. The company has won many awards, including the best transatlantic airline and the best airline award in a survey of business customers. In 1998 it was asked to look at a possible strategic alliance and a report was submitted to the Minister that year which made it clear that the long-term strategy of the company was to build sustainable profitability based on a market position as a differentiated, high quality full service added value airline providing direct and connecting passenger and cargo services to all of Ireland's major markets.</P>
    <P>Great efforts have been made by Aer Lingus, which is not to say the company does not have problems, including industrial relations problems. However, every time Members try to raise these issues in the House the Minister has washed her <Col N="541" /> hands of them by passing responsibility to the unions and management. The Minister is the shareholder of the company on our behalf and she cannot wash her hands of the problems in it. As a result of the failure to adopt a hands-on approach by the Minister and her Department to ensure that these problems are addressed with vision and management capability, the value placed on the company has dropped. I am very angry about that. It is regrettable that a company that was the jewel in the crown among public companies has declined in value during the Minister's term of office to such a point that people are now talking of a trade sale. It is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I will not stand over the sale of the company to a bidder, perhaps to an entrepreneur who has no interest in the airline business and who may gradually sell off parts of it. In a recent newspaper article it was speculated that the company would be divided up, with the transatlantic section sold to one buyer and the Europe section to another. That would mean we would have no national identity with the airline, which is needed. Other Governments have divested themselves of their national airlines but they have remained identified with the countries. Iberia Airlines is associated with Spain and Lufthansa is associated with Germany. I do not want someone to buy a bit of Aer Lingus and give it a new name with which we cannot identify.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister recognises the damage she and the Government have done to the workforce in Aer Lingus. They are demoralised and do not know what is happening. I spoke to a senior trade union official who has dealt with this issue but even at that level he did not know what is happening. The Minister has offered to meet the unions but they are seeking a full audit of the company's assets and value. They cannot get this information. When they receive it they will be prepared to meet the Minister but not on the basis of a trade sale. I urge the Minister not to press her amendment for the sake of the many thousands of people in the north Dublin region and the surrounding areas who get their living from Aer Lingus or who are in ancillary employment. She will regret it if she does.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to allow Aer Lingus to raise the capital investment of approximately £350 million which it says it requires? I understand the EU may not give permission for further investment. The Minister must find a way of ensuring it is available, through public-private partnership or whatever.</P>
    <P>I received a letter concerning the Minister from the representative of the pensioners of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. There are approximately 4,500 in all and they include widows and widowers of pensioners who worked in both companies. The Minister had a high profile meeting with their representatives involving the Fianna Fáil element of the Oireachtas Members. There were many photographs in the local newspapers following that meeting and the impression was given <Col N="542" /> by the Minister that she would be able to do something to address outstanding issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lot of humbug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The Minister has washed her hands of the problems. In a letter dated 16 June, the secretary of the Pension Action Committee states: &ldquo;Instead, in various replies to Dáil questions she tries to give an impression that a new scheme will address our problem but she knows that the management of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are steadfastly refusing to address the inadequate pensions provided to our members in their proposals for a new scheme.&rdquo;  In another instance the Minister gave the impression that the IPO would provide an opportunity for this issue to be discussed. She knows that is not the case but she is trying to fool the pensioners, people who gave their lives to both these companies, into forgetting about the issue until after the next election and encourages them to vote for her party because it offers them some hope. The letter continues:</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks about many representations, her meeting with us and our meeting with officials of her Department, again giving the impression that she is listening and acting on our behalf. The evidence is all to the contrary. She fails to record that these meetings and representations have had zero results and that our organisation has been forced to express our frustration in the bluntest terms.</P>
      <P>This is what the pension action committee thinks of the Minister's actions. This is another issue the Minister has tried to abandon. I urge her to take more interest in the lot of these pensioners and to find a way of ensuring that they receive a pension for the rest of their lives. This is possible and the Minister can do it. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, found a way to give pensions to former employees of the sweepstakes after years of attempts to secure pensions. The Minister should find a way to do that in this area. I hope that, when the time comes, she will not push the amendment and she will accept the Fine Gael Party's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in supporting the motion and I wish to outline the experience of people in my constituency in recent days since the Minister's announcement of, as Deputy Owen called it, a car boot sale. It is a difficult matter to understand. If the Minister did not understand that the support of Aer Lingus employees was important, some of her advisers should have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Aer Lingus's last annual report, great emphasis is placed on the operation and financial review of the employees' share participation scheme. I fully support this scheme and it is a great idea because people should work. However, it is most disconcerting when people who are <Col N="543" /> employed in Shannon ring to ask what is happening because nobody has told them. The trade unions and the management cannot tell them although the Minister announced that a sale will take place.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the quality of the service provided in Dublin Airport, a quality service, such as the one provided by Aer Lingus in Shannon, is necessary for the survival of the airport. The Minister knows that the operating costs in Shannon are such that the service provided by Aer Lingus at present must continue. If there is a car boot sale, undoubtedly, there will not be the same confidence in a new company servicing an airport that does not have a sufficient population stock to ensure that it can expand or participate in profit-making parts of the company.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that when Shannon was the only transatlantic airport, Aer Lingus operated a successful service to the United States and Dublin. The prices paid on the route were a little higher than the prices charged by other airlines, but the people on the western seaboard made a contribution to Aer Lingus and kept it going. I find it difficult to understand why the Minister would get rid of the national airline. I doubt there will be a national airline and if that is the case, there will only be irregular flights into Shannon Airport. The airport will be akin to Farranfore with only occasional flights. If that happens, tourism and other services on the west coast will reach the point where they are abandoned.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has served Shannon well, although I was critical of some of its actions from time to time. For example, when it wanted to get rid of the airport's transatlantic status, it said aircraft would be parked in Shannon and that crews would live in the area. I ask the Minister to go to Shannon and count the small number of crews for transatlantic flights who now live there. Mr. Cahill is a great person to send as a front man. He illustrates his confidence with his double chin and he listens and takes in everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have double chins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>He must get a taste of reality because many people in the mid-west region depend on Shannon and its services. Industry in the area wants Aer Lingus to remain there. Other companies have come and gone, but Aer Lingus has remained because it is a national company and the national interest is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State owes money to Aer Lingus because, in the past, when Aer Lingus and Aer Línte were separate companies and made substantial profits, the Minister for Finance took his lion's share of them. This money should have been used to update equipment in Aer Lingus and to provide better and more modern national services. Instead, Aer Lingus must hunt everywhere for capital. The amalgamation with American Airlines has worked well. In the <Col N="544" /> middle of 2000, Mr. Bernie Cahill said everything was all right and nothing was wrong. In the flight packs at Christmas, the former general manger, Mr. Foley, said a major development was Aer Lingus joining the One World global alliance as a full member, enabling the company to provide its customers with access to a greater route network and significant frequent flier and lounge benefits.</P>
    <P>There has been an amazing turn around in Aer Lingus's fortunes in a short time. How did the Minister not have any control over the situation? Why was there nobody in Aer Lingus to put up a red flag about the situation? People in Iarnród Éireann and CIE put up many red flags for the Minister, but apparently there was nobody in Aer Lingus to give her notice that matters had deteriorated. Some people have complained about industrial relations in the company, but, in the main, they have been good. I do not remember any industrial relations problems involving Aer Lingus staff at Shannon. It appears that when issues arise in Dublin, the Minister is unable to control them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the IPO, the people advising the Minister about shares, sales and flotations should be changed because the Eircom flotation experience is enough to put everybody off. However, an IPO is the only way to go if the Minister is intent on taking that direction. I remind the Minister that the Minister for Finance took surplus funds from Aer Lingus and Aer Línte over many years when profits were made, particularly on the transatlantic route. This route through Shannon Airport kept Aer Lingus going, but it will be now left out.</P>
    <P>I admire Aer Lingus for continuing bilingualism. It makes announcements on its flights in Irish and English and I admire the staff who continue that practice. Their actions show there is a separate Irish culture which is valuable and worth keeping. I ask the Minister to ensure that is maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the Government decision of December 1999 authorising the Minister for Public Enterprise to initiate an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of shares in Aer Lingus;</P>
      <P>notes the Government's decision was heavily influenced by the need to strengthen Aer Lingus' capital base and to position the company to prosper and grow against the background of radical restructuring in the global aviation industry;</P>
      <P>notes that the company's trading position in 2001 has been severely affected by the impact of industrial unrest and the foot and mouth outbreak and increasingly by external market conditions;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> recognises that, as a result, it will not be possible to complete the IPO in the near future;</P>
    <P>commends the Minister for Public Enterprise for taking action to address the needs of Aer Lingus in its changing environment by having her advisers examine all sale options, in addition to an IPO, to ensure the company's future going forward and to report back to the Minister for Public Enterprise on their findings; and</P>
    <P>welcomes the fact that arising from the Minister's recent discussions with unions, agreement has been reached on the resumption of negotiations on the increased shareholding of 9.9% of the company for Aer Lingus employees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thank the Fine Gael Members for tabling the motion. I propose to share time with Deputy Pat Carey at eight o'clock. As the House will be aware the Government authorised me in December 1999 to initiate a process leading to an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus. The IPO decision was the culmination of a process started by the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Alan Dukes, in 1997 when he mandated the board of Aer Lingus to explore the possibilities of the airline entering a strategic alliance with or without the transfer of equity and to submit proposals to the shareholder. In a reply to the Minister in early May 1997 the airline said it would commence this process.</P>
    <P>The process involved a number of reports by the airline and independent advisers engaged by myself and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It resulted in Aer Lingus's entry into the Oneworld Alliance and after further analysis of funding related issues, a decision to proceed with an IPO of shares in the airline. The analysis undertaken by my advisers revealed that the airline needed funds to strengthen its capital base to take advantage of growth opportunities afforded by the alliance and to cushion against any industry downturn.</P>
    <P>In addition to the capital needs, the Government's decision for an IPO was heavily influenced by how best to position a small niche carrier like Aer Lingus to prosper and grow in an industry undergoing significant changes arising from alliance consolidation, ownership changes, increased competition from low cost carriers and accelerated technological innovation. Following on from the Government's decision on an IPO, the advisers to facilitate the implementation of the IPO were engaged. The Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, to provide the legislative framework for the IPO was published and passed through Seanad Éireann last summer. Discussions were also initiated with the Aer Lingus unions on an increased shareholding of 9.9% of the company for the Aer Lingus employees in addition to their current holding of 5%. While significant progress was achieved, these discussions were suspended <Col N="546" /> last summer as a consequence of industrial relations problems in the airline.</P>
    <P>These industrial relations problems, combined with difficult market conditions, have delayed implementation of the IPO. A further influence on timing is Aer Lingus's performance in 2001. This will be seriously affected by the impact of the industrial relations unrest, the foot and mouth outbreak and, increasingly, by the softening economic conditions, particularly in the important US market. While the first two matters can hopefully be considered once-off, in relation to the latter there is some evidence emerging internationally of a downturn in aviation.</P>
    <P>The above factors, when combined with the significantly increased cost base as a result of recent pay settlements and higher fuel costs, are likely to result in the airline moving into a loss for 2001 even if there is significant recovery in performance over the remainder of the year. Having regard to these factors and particularly their impact on the timing of the planned IPO, it would be irresponsible of me not to keep under review all options for giving effect to the Government decision to privatise Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Strong and resolute decisions are required in relation to the future direction of Aer Lingus and unless these decisions are taken soon, less palatable choices could emerge which would not be in the interest of the airline, its customers or its employees. In this context, particularly the financial position already referred to, I recently asked my advisers to look at alternative sale options for the airline, take soundings of interest from potential investors or buyers and report back to me within a few weeks. This does not represent a U-turn by the Government nor does it mean that the IPO has been abandoned. The Government remains committed to the privatisation of Aer Lingus as the best option for the airline going forward.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate, however, given all the commercial issues facing the airline and developments in aviation globally, that I and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, should review all possible options for the privatisation of the company. This is now being done. It is too early to speculate on the outcome of the advisers' work. If there is merit in alternative sale options, having regard to the report of the advisers and other relevant issues, a formal sale process will be launched at the appropriate time which will be open and transparent. The enabling legislation will also come before Dáil Éireann to allow any transaction to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I have apprised the Aer Lingus unions of these developments in recent discussions and agreement has been reached on the resumption of discussions with the unions on increasing the current employees shareholding up to 14.9% of the company. I inform the House that I had a very full meeting with the unions involved in the week before last and further meetings are planned, one for this Thursday with others to follow next week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> Aer Lingus is operating in an industry undergoing fundamental and dramatic changes and this new environment demands on-going and significant adjustment. It is clear that changes in consumer attitudes towards travel, combined with shifts in the economics of the airline business, are placing the traditional national flag carriers such as Aer Lingus under increasing pressure. Across Europe Governments have responded to these challenges by reducing or withdrawing from direct control and/or ownership of airlines. This includes BA, KLM, Lufthansa, Iberia, Air France, Alitalia, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.</P>
    <P>In today's airline industry Aer Lingus needs the operational and financial independence and flexibility to equip itself against the various competitive forces facing the airline. This can best be achieved in the private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very difficult 12 months for Aer Lingus arising from a combination of internal difficulties and external market conditions. In this industry, which is very vulnerable to external shocks over which it has no control, it is vitally important that the internal difficulties over which the airline has control are resolved speedily and effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that management and staff will now quickly and jointly address outstanding difficulties and refocus on the needs of the business so that appropriate strategies can be adopted to allow the airline grow and prosper in a difficult trading environment, which is demonstrated by the latest statistics for all the major European airlines taken together as released by the Association of European Airlines. It reported a fall in passenger volumes for April 2001, the first monthly year on year decline since autumn 1991 when travel suffered because of the Gulf War. These figures incorporate a traffic decline of over 4% on the north Atlantic. The impact of this downturn has already been felt by all European carriers, including BA, Lufthansa and KLM, all of whom have recently reported deteriorating performances.</P>
      <P>I regret that Aer Lingus has been in the headlines recently for all the wrong reasons but it is emphatically not in a terminal crisis. Let me put on record that I do not intend to let such a crisis develop.</P>

      <P>That is why I am now looking at all options. Many Deputies will recall the last crisis in the early 1990s and the trauma involved for all concerned. Let me remind the House of some of the details. By 1993, and that was the <Col N="548" /> year in which Labour and Fianna Fáil were in Government together, the group was losing £1million per week. Group debt was in excess of £500 million, shareholder funds had fallen from £443 million to £73 million, a cash crisis was looming and the banks were expressing concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>All this led to the Cahill plan which involved widespread restructuring including cost savings, rationalisation, disposal of non-core assets and a one-off Government cash injection of £175 million. There were over 1,200 redundancies and remaining staff agreed to changes in work practices and pay freezes &ndash; the consequences of which are still being felt by the airline.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to preside over a Cahill plan Mark 2 and that is why I am, as I said earlier, looking at all options for the future of the airline. The question of State aid has also been raised. I would like to remind the House that on the approval of the State aid package, a commitment was given by that Government in 1993 to the European Commission that no further State aid would be given to Aer Lingus. Since that time it has been the position of all Governments that no further State funds would be made available to the airline and I do not intend to change that position.</P>

The ownership and control of airlines is governed by the terms of the EU licensing regulation No. 2407 of 1992, and the terms of bilateral air services agreements. Under the EU regulation, airlines must be &ldquo;owned directly or through majority ownership by member states and/or nationals of member states&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to operate in the European Single Market while the terms of bilateral air services agreements stipulate that designated carriers must be &ldquo;substantially owned and effectively controlled&rdquo; by nationals or corporations of the State which designates the airline, or by the State itself. Irrespective of the method or timing of the sale of Aer Lingus, given the current international and national rules on airline ownership, Aer Lingus must remain in majority EU ownership to continue to operate within Europe and remain substantially owned and effectively controlled by Irish nationals or corporations to continue to operate on US routes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>These nationality requirements are not a new development. They apply to airlines worldwide and have long been a key regulatory control in the aviation world. They are likely to continue to influence developments and relationships outside the EU until replaced by multilateral agreements which I believe will not occur for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My advisers have already, in the context of preparations for the IPO, made recommend<Col N="550" /> ations on mechanisms that would allow Aer Lingus to ensure compliance with nationality requirements following a sale. These mechanisms have been deployed in the privatisation of state controlled airlines in other jurisdictions. The purpose of these mechanisms will be to ensure that Aer Lingus can continue to be regarded as an Irish airline and thereby continue to fly to countries within the EU Single Market and to countries with which Ireland has entered bilateral agreements, of which the US is by far the most important. The House can be assured that irrespective of which sale option is chosen or whenever that occurs, the Government will ensure that appropriate arrangements are put in place to protect traffic rights. Despite a welter of negative and sometimes misleading comment and the difficult trading conditions, Aer Lingus is a good company with an excellent brand. It has an admirable record in customer service which can be regained if staff and management co-operate in meeting the challenges ahead and in providing a quality service at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>It is to ensure that the company can build on these positives and, most importantly&mdash;</P>

      <P>We now move to much more comprehensive meetings on this Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make two points. There have been various references to the chairman. Mr. Cahill has <Col N="551" /> been appointed and reappointed by various Governments of differing hues, by Fianna Fáil by Fianna Fáil in coalition with the Labour Party and by the Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left coalition Government. The chairman has enjoyed the trust of people from various political parties in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter. I wish to refer to the matter concerning Mr. Foley. This was raised by Deputy Jim Higgins who said I gave the impression that he was very much my man. I have only met Mr. Foley once, at a social function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been a good idea to get to know him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman and the board sought out Mr. Foley and he came to Aer Lingus. A month later, I met him at a social function. I did not seek him out, as the Deputy said. I could not do that because I did not know him. It is not my role to decide who to appoint as the chief executive of a commercial company nor is it my role as the shareholder to decide how strikes will be settled. A favourite of Fine Gael among chairmen, Mr. Joyce, said that he resigned because I was taking an interest in the company of which he was chairman. That was CIE and, as it happened, I should have taken a much keener interest during that stewardship, as things are now arising.</P>
      <P>There was a question why I did not address the issue of capital investment. Deputy Donal Carey spoke about flights to Farranfore. I wish to inform the House that Farranfore now has four flights a day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said Farranfore had an odd flight per week or some such remark. The final point I wish to address is the Shannon stop-over. When I came into Government there was ambiguity about the Shannon stop-over as to whether we would be resolute at European Council meetings about our particular stance. At the first Council of Ministers meeting I attended as a representative of the Government I made my position clear and I have continued to do so at every transport meeting at which that issue has been raised. I got somebody to look over the records and I find that it has been raised seven times in various ways seeking to push out the boundaries. The Government gave a commitment to retain the Shannon stop-over. I continue to give that commitment. I am glad that at a very important <Col N="552" /> time when ambiguity was beginning to creep into policy making that I was on hand to ensure that continued.</P>
      <P>I wish to share ten minutes out of my half hour with Deputy Pat Carey. The Ceann Comhairle agreed to that.</P>

Like Deputy Owen I am not surprised they have won so many awards. I am deeply saddened that recently they have been beset by problems and those problems need to be overcome. I know from my discussions with the workers that they are determined to overcome the most recent setbacks even those at senior management level. Let us not fool ourselves.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The growing liberalisation of the European air transport industry in the early 1990s and the subsequent pressures on all airlines, including traditional national flag carriers, to operate in a truly commercial way led in turn to significant permanent changes in the market environment for airlines with the development of global strategic alliances and the emergence of low cost no frills airlines. We have seen that where there has been recession. On the basis of the September 1998 report, the Government accepted the Aer Lingus view that the airline should seek to participate in a major strategic alliance and authorise the company to enter into discussions with prospective alliance partner airlines with a view to obtaining proposals from those airlines. It also concluded that an alliance could involve an equity stake in Aer Lingus. The Government requested that the Aer Lingus board submit a report at the conclusion of discussions with prospective alliance partners in which it would make specific recommendations on the future strategic direction of the airline. The subsequent report submitted in April 1999 by the Aer Lingus board sought the approval of the Government to proceed with a major operation, a strategic alliance subject to satisfactory due diligence, etc. In July 1999 the consultants report supported Aer Lingus recommendations for a strategic alliance and concluded that the company needed additional capital to fund the growth opportunities. In July 1999 the Government approved an Aer Lingus proposal to oper<Col N="555" /> ate strategic alliances with American airlines and British Airways. The Aer Lingus alliance includes extensive co-operation with British Airways on a range of issues including frequent flyer programmer, scheduled co-ordination sales and marketing. In addition to the significant benefits to Aer Lingus in participating in a major strategic alliance, the alliance also offers substantial benefits to travellers to and from Ireland.</P>

      <P>To delete: &ldquo;&ndash; make a clear statement as to what Government plans are for the future of the airline.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for giving the House the opportunity to debate this important and urgent matter.</P>
      <P>Despite the current difficulties it is undergoing, Aer Lingus has been one of the outstanding successes not just of State enterprise but also of commercial life generally in this country and the Government is going to flog it. Since it was established in 1936, Aer Lingus has played a central role in the development of the economic and commercial life of this country, but they are going to flog it.</P>
      <P>Without Aer Lingus, our tourism industry would never have developed to the extent it did and without the high quality reliable service it provided for both passengers and cargo, it is doubtful if this country would have been able to attract and sustain the high level of investment from overseas which has contributed so much to our economic development, especially over the past decade. However, Fíanna Fáil is going to flog it.</P>
      <P>Apart perhaps from Guinness, Aer Lingus is probably the brand name most associated internationally with Ireland. That brand image is an important national asset as it has come to symbolise safety, high quality, efficiency and reliable service. It is a national asset that we should seek to enhance and protect and most certainly not to discard, but Deputy Pat Carey of North Dublin somewhere, supports the Minister in her determination to flog Aer Lingus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The air travel business is notoriously cyclical. There is hardly a major international carrier, private or state owned, that has not experienced major difficulties in the past decade. Aer Lingus has had its share of problems, most significantly in the early 1990s when it nearly came to grief. It was largely as a result of the commitment and dedication of the workers who made significant sacrifices that the company was put back on a sound footing. It has enjoyed a number of successful trading years since then, which have also seen the expansion of the fleet and development of new routes.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has been misfortunate in having a Minister who is incapable of dealing with the complexities of her Department and is given to hare-brained, off-the-cuff and often contradictory statements on the direction and policy for the companies in her remit. This had led to damaging uncertainty.</P>

    <P>Every time there is a difficulty, every time there is a hard decision to be made, every time leadership is required we get the same responses from the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke &ndash; find someone to pass the buck to, sell off the trouble<Col N="557" /> some enterprise or, Minister's favourite, appoint a quango.</P>
    <P>While this is going on the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, sticks with the photo opportunities and late chat show quizzes.</P>

      <P>I will never stop regretting that as I have said in this House on many occasions. The mistake is continuing and the Minister is continuing to hand over people's power to quangos outside this House at every chance she gets.</P>
      <P>She threatened to sell the ESB, the Gas Company and Íarnród Éireann. The usual bribery of workers with share holdings did not work in these cases. She talked the Luas light rail project to death and it will cost £500 million to bury the corpse. She tried to hoodwink the aviation pensioners with baseless and false promises. This is a scandalous carry on.</P>
      <P>In the case of Aer Lingus, she has prevaricated on its fate for the past four years. First it was to be retained and developed as a commercial State enterprise which would not be a problem. Then the privatisation fever infected our Minister for Public Enterprise and her true Thatcherite political position came to the fore.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus was now to be privatised by means of an IPO, whereby shares in the company would be offered for sale. The full scale of the Eircom disaster was not yet apparent and the Minister intended to repeat the performance.</P>
      <P>As Eircom began to unwind, the Minister, to protect her own political hide &ndash; and she is very good at that &ndash; began to cast doubts publicly on the IPO option but the fat consultants appointed by her continue with the IPO option.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty created by this prevarication led to serious commercial and industrial relations problems for the company. The company was effectively prevented from pursuing its necessary investment programme and three chief executive officers have now come and gone during the Minister's reign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the uncertainty created by the Minister, workers, through their unions, sought to protect their positions by lodging and pursuing claims for wage increases and better conditions. Despite the <Col N="558" /> glamorous image associated with the airline business, the fact is that many Aer Lingus workers endure unacceptably low pay and relatively poor working conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister's inability to make a clear decision and to establish clear policy for Irish aviation has led to practically every problem now being faced by the national airline. What is her response to this disaster she has created? Let there be no doubt, she did create it.</P>

Tonight she confirmed that she is absolutely determined to flog Aer Lingus regardless of the conditions.</P>
      <P>Fíanna Fáil, this great republican party, was now proposing that the strategically important national airline was to be dumped in a depressed market. It was to be subject of a glorified fire sale or monster car boot sale, all because the Minister is incapable or unwilling to deal with the crisis of confidence created by the Minister's own actions and confusion.</P>
      <P>Within days of the Minister's cop-out trade sale decision, the Taoiseach intervened in the debate. Most unusually for the Taoiseach, he was clear and unequivocal. He said in the Dáil last week: &ldquo;There will be no trade sale &ndash; the decision for IPO stands.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>How are the national airline and other important State commercial enterprises <Col N="559" /> under the remit of this incompetent Minister to behave in the face of confusion and conflicting indecision as to their future? They are now stranded in a policy vacuum. My sympathy also goes out to the excellent civil servants who have to operate without direction or leadership from this Minister in this section.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that the Government strategy for dealing with Aer Lingus is in total chaos with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise publicly contradicting each other as to the Government's preferred option for the future of the company. We got more of that tonight. At a time when the airline is experiencing internal management problems and a downturn in the market and it needs clarity and consistency from the Government, what it is getting is confusion, contradictory statements and key Ministers at odds with each other. The lack of a coherent Government policy is posing as big a threat to the future of Aer Lingus as any of the other problems it faces. Beyond doubt, a trade sale would be the most disastrous possible option. It would leave it open to sale at a bargain basement price to a rival whose primary interest may well be its landing slots at Heathrow and which might well cut key routes or even sell it off altogether.</P>
      <P>For an island nation, heavily dependent on tourism, an efficient, reliable national carrier is absolutely essential, but Fianna Fáil proposes to flog it. Aer Lingus has served the nation well for over 60 years and the prospect of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, preparing to hawk the company around the world, like some Molly Malone of the midlands, has filled both staff and customers with dismay. The Minister has placed Aer Lingus in an impossible situation and for every day she remains as Minister, their situation will only get worse. Her actions or lack of them have proved that she is not up to the task at hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No convincing case has been made for the privatisation of Aer Lingus. As we have seen with Eircom, once a company is privatised no control is possible over what then happens to it. The myth of large numbers of the public retaining small shareholdings in a privatised company is just that &ndash; a myth. The mobile division of Eircom is now in the hands of a British company and the fixed line division is about to end up in the hands of a small group of very wealthy, largely foreign, private investors. If Aer Lingus was to be floated, there would be every likelihood that it would follow the Eircom precedent and within a couple of months would fall victim to another predator airline or end up in the hands of a small number of wealthy investors. The only factor that would interest these people would be profit. No doubt, some of the Minister's colleagues would see nothing wrong with this. The strategic interests of Ireland, the needs of our tourism industry and the needs of our industrial or commercial sector would not figure on that agenda at all. We would find ourselves without a national <Col N="560" /> carrier, with routes pared down to an absolute minimum and perhaps thousands of staff thrown out of work.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has taken a pragmatic but principled approach to the issue of privatisation. We have judged each case on its individual merits. We are not opposing the sale of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and did not oppose the sale of the Trustee Savings Bank. Where there are convincing arguments that the interests of the consumer and the wider community will be served by privatisation, we will not oppose it, but we will not go along the road of ideologically driven privatisation, especially where this is likely to be to the disadvantage of the consumer and the wider community. This is most certainly the case with Aer Lingus. That is the reason we have tabled an amendment to the Fine Gael motion, seeking to delete the last sentence which simply calls on the Government to make a clear statement as to its future plans for the airline &ndash; which, as we now know, are to flog it &ndash; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Calls on the Government to recognise that the strategic role of Aer Lingus as our national carrier can best be guaranteed by the airline remaining in public ownership and to enter into discussions with the management and trade unions to devise and acceptable strategy for the future of the company.</P>

I regret her change of policy to the extent that she is determined to flog Aer Lingus to whoever may come forward and divest Ireland of what has been a major flag-carrying commercial project for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the present position in which Aer Lingus finds itself. In considering the Fine Gael motion, the Labour Party amendment and the Government's reply, it is worth considering the history of Aer Lingus to which the Minister made some reference. Her speech was an extraordinary mixture of paradox and contradiction in practi<Col N="561" /> cally every page. For example, she said: &ldquo;It is to ensure that the company can build on these positives, most importantly access to capital to fund the new aircraft, to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities and to rebalance its fleet to ensure a more cost-efficient mix between owned and leased aircraft.&rdquo;  That does not require privatisation. There is nothing in any EU regulation which has impeded other air companies associated with states in the European Union from proceeding to fund aircraft and the rebalancing of fleets.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to consider the background to the Minister's unwillingness to contemplate the possibility that the company might remain in State ownership. We are in the process of transferring what is left of the national telecommunications infrastructure to a private individual. I am amazed that, in this Republic, the thought has not occurred to many people that the two significant bidders for what was a State asset are both tax exiles. It is fascinating that people who are unwilling to accept the discipline of living in the country and paying their capital gains taxes and other taxes but decide to live abroad, become the new owners of what was previously a State asset. There is something morally reprehensible about the public acceptance of this as a kind of fact which cannot be disputed.</P>
      <P>The same ethos guided the Minister's speech, in which she suggested time and again that what she is doing is for the purpose of giving security to Aer Lingus. She also mentioned that she has confidence in the airline and asked the staff to work together with management and Government to ensure the future of the company. That sounds wonderful, but how can she create an atmosphere in which that is possible if she is saying she is not yet sure to whom she is selling it? She is not sure of the value of the asset and every single action which she takes is devaluing it, almost in every sentence and every paragraph.</P>
      <P>There is an extraordinary ideological confusion involved here. It begins with the prejudice that the State cannot be involved and moves to an assumption which is not validated anywhere. Through their taxes, people built up the State companies at a time when huxters were opposing them. The original State companies all encountered objections, as documented by Todd Andrews. The Sugar Company wanted to make galvanised buckets but could not do so because a huxter was producing them somewhere and the State could not interfere with private enterprise. That is the traditional thinking which is at the heart of the Minister's speech. There is nothing to prevent the State from being involved in replacing or leasing aircraft and renewing the fleet. Such involvement has happened all over Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of certainty and the Cahill plan, which is a great achievement by the workers. She said: &ldquo;The industry is undergoing significant changes arising from alliance, consoli<Col N="562" /> dation, ownership changes, increased competition from low cost carriers and accelerated technological innovation.&rdquo;  It is up to her to show that consumers would benefit from any changes which take place. What about the competition which is so superficial that it is, in fact, a disguised monopoly? I challenge the Minister to show what is happening in relation to the flotations to which I referred. If the flotation leads to a concentration of share ownership with no commitment to consumers, how can it be regarded as some great liberalising benefit to consumers, in this case air travellers? Nowhere in the Minister's 14 page speech is there one reference to the national economy or security benefiting from having a State airline. That is an important consideration. It is important to a country that relies on tourism for its economy and for an island country that relies on greater relationships with Europe, even though half the Cabinet seems to want to go to America instead.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks of her certainty but at the same time she is asking her advisers to look at alternative sales options for the airline, to take soundings of interest from potential investors or buyers and to report back to her within a few weeks. As I child I drove cattle to Newmarket-on-Fergus and Sixmilebridge fair but one would not sell much if one was to operate like that nowadays. The Minister does not know the value of the company. Everything she does is to devalue the asset. It is little less than a cheap little bribe&mdash;</P>

For other reasons, I have not had an opportunity to examine it in that context but I am sure the Minister of State will remind me of the position. The net point remains the same, that is, that information that comes into the possession of the director should be transferred to the Competition Authority where a possible breach of competition law is involved.

      <P>I support the principle of the amendment. It makes sense and is something we teased out on Committee Stage. One arm of the State will collect and collate information and will carry out investigations in relation to companies. All of us would agree that the Competition Authority needs to be given more resources than it is being given at present. It is acting with one hand tied behind its back. When the new position of Director of Corporate Enforcement is established, and if they come across instances where competition legislation is being broken or abused, that information should rightfully be furnished to the Competition Authority. It is ludicrous to have one State organisation carry out an investigation, while six months later another State body carries out a similar investigation. Even if the first one came across information, it could not furnish it to the other body &ndash; the Competition Authority. This amendment would ensure resources are better spent and that where breaches of the law take place, they are followed up and prosecutions are taken if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that it should be a function of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to put forward information to the Competition Authority where that information relates to the possible breach of competition law. The Tánaiste agreed on Committee Stage that the Director of Corporate Enforcement should forward any such information that comes into his or her possession to the Competition Authority. Amendment No. 41 on Committee Stage provided for this by amending section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990. This amendment provided that information obtained by the Director of Corporate Enforcement under sections 19 or 20 of the 1990 Act may be disclosed for the purposes of <Col N="564" /> the performance by the Competition Authority of any of its functions.</P>
      <P>By virtue of section 17, any information that may be relevant to the Competition Authority, which is obtained by the director or his or her staff in the course of the performance of their official duties, may be disclosed to the authority. This is the appropriate way to provide for the transfer of relevant information by the director to the Competition Authority rather than make it a function of the director to do so which this amendment proposes.</P>

      <P>I am puzzled by that because the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicated her intention on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, it has become a pattern among Ministers in that Department whereby on Committee Stage one is led to believe an amendment has been taken on board but when one gets to Report Stage, one finds the amendment does not materialise. I am quite sure the Tánaiste intended that it would materialise and that she was sincere in supporting the thrust of the amendment. I am very disappointed to find that there seems to have been a rethink on that.</P>
      <P>I lost the key contribution of the Minister of State in terms of explaining the whys and wherefores but I have the reference from the Tánaiste who stated on Committee Stage that if I was agreeable, following consultation with the chief parliamentary counsel, she would be more than happy to bring forward an amendment to section 17 requiring the director to pass on information to the Competition Authority. Will the Minister of State clarify the position in that context because I find it difficult to understand what seems to be a complete reversal from Committee Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We provided for this on Committee Stage under section 31(<i>d</i>). Amendment No. 41 amended section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990. This amendment provided that information obtained by the Director of Corporate Enforcement under sections 19 or 20 of the 1990 Act may be disclosed for the purposes of the performance by the Competition Authority of any of its functions. By virtue of section 17 of this Bill any information that may be relevant to the Competition Authority, which is obtained by the director or his or her staff in the course of the performance of their official duties, may be disclosed the authority. This is the appropriate way to do this. Section 31(<i>c</i>) is very clear. We are providing opportunity for information to be transferred. That is a change in the Bill which was made to <Col N="565" /> section 31.

      <P>In page 12, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Notwithstanding that he or she has been so seconded but without prejudice to <i>subsections (3) </i>and <i>(4),</i> a member of the Garda Síochána seconded to the office of the Director shall continue to be under the general direction and control of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>(4) A member of the Garda Síochána so seconded shall continue to be vested with and may exercise or perform the powers or duties of a member of the Garda Síochána for purposes other than the purposes of this Act, as well as for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 12 relates to the functions of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The existing subsection (4) empowers the Director of Corporate Enforcement to perform many of the functions assigned to the director through his or her officers and that in the performance of those functions, the officer will be subject to the directions of the director only. These amendments relate to the members of the Garda Síochána who will be seconded to the office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to assist the director.</P>
      <P>The amendments have two effects. First, the proposed new subsection (3) clarifies the power of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to give directions to seconded gardaí. The existing text could be so construed that in carrying out their duties while on secondment to the office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, gardaí would only be subject to the directions and control of the director. It was not our intention to make the Director of Corporate Enforcement responsible for the assignment, career advancement, discipline or other personnel issues of a seconded garda as these functions should remain the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. Seconded gardaí will be solely subject to the directions of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in the exercise of powers given to the director under this Bill. However, the general personnel function pertaining to those gardaí will continue to be a matter for the Garda authorities. Section 4 provides that members of the Garda Síochána seconded to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement shall continue to exercise the powers available to them as gardaí, in addition to the powers they may exercise as officers of the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> I proposed this amendment following discussions between my Department and the Garda authorities to clarify the powers of the Garda Síochána seconded to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. While it was always our intention that seconded gardaí would retain their normal powers while in secondment, this Bill did not specifically provide for this. Amendment No. 2 rectifies this and I ask Members to accept it.</P>

It is not clear where it says that &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána seconded to the office of the Director shall continue to be under the general direction and control of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;  It does not say, as the Minister has stated, that the Garda member shall be under the general direction and control of the Garda Commissioner in respect of personnel matters. In an investigation directed by the Director of Corporate Enforcement, from whom does a garda take instructions?</P>
      <P>None of us in this House is particularly concerned about the career path of a garda or an extra clothing allowance being the responsibility of the commissioner. In terms of the functions of the director, when a garda is involved, does he have two masters? Is he responding to the director or the commissioner? It reminds me of a not-dissimilar situation that concerned the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. It was the view in this case that the director might not be a member of the Garda Síochána. It was the subject of some discussion at the time. The Criminal Assets Bureau worked well, but the matter was resolved in favour of the garda being number one and Mr. Galvin being number two. I am curious about the origin of this section. From where did it come? When was it inserted? Am I wrong in saying I cannot recall it from Committee Stage?</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte made a good point regarding the question to whom a garda will be answerable. It is important it is clarified. A garda would appear to be under the rule of the commissioner. Who will be the boss when the director has complete autonomy in his duties as an enforcer of the obligations of the Company Law Enforcement Act?</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste signalled on Committee Stage that she intended to clarify this matter <Col N="567" /> and bring forward an amendment so there would be no ambiguity pertaining to the role of gardaí as members of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement &ndash; they would obviously be responsible to the Director of Corporate Enforcement while working for him or her. Regarding their personnel role and future promotion etc., they would also be subject to the control of the Garda Commissioner, whom they would be under at all times as members of the Garda Síochána. To ensure that they remain members of the Garda Síochána, we are clarifying in this amendment that those on secondment still remain members of the Garda Síochána with the full powers of that body while discharging their duties. The Garda authorities anticipate that in any future criminal proceedings brought by or on the instigation of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, gardaí seconded to the director's office will be subject to rigorous cross-examination as to the source of the legal powers exercised by them.</P>
      <P>Difficulties might arise when a seconded garda, while carrying out his duties, finds himself relying on powers not vested in the Director of Corporate Enforcement, whether these be under the Criminal Justice Acts or other legislation. An example of this might include a case in which, while conducting a search of a premises under the Companies Acts, officers of the director encounter obstruction, assault or other unlawful activity requiring the arrest and detention of one or more persons under the Criminal Justice Acts or other legislation.</P>
      <P>As the Bill does not specifically provide that seconded gardaí continue to be vested with their normal powers as members of the Garda Síochána, personnel could be unsure of their legal powers in a given situation. This amendment seeks to clarify these powers by specifying that a garda seconded to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement can continue to exercise the powers and duties of a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The wording in this amendment is consistent with the wording in section 8(8) of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996. In that Act, members of the Garda Síochána are seconded to the Criminal Assets Bureau and appointed as officers of the chief bureau officer. The bureau is a multi-disciplinary unit like the director's office, which requires seconded gardaí to exercise and perform the powers and duties of members of the Garda Síochána in addition to their specific powers and functions as officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. I hope this clarifies matters so we can maximise the value of having members of the Garda Síochána seconded to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>

      <P>I understand the thinking behind this amendment. I support it and the notion that gardaí might be seconded. However, the transcript of the Minister's remarks may be regurgitated down the years in the event of a dispute arising. I cannot see how subsection (3) provides for what the Minister intends it to provide. Notwithstanding that a garda has been so seconded, without prejudice to subsections (3) and (4), a member of the Garda Síochána seconded to the office of the director shall continue to be under the general direction and control of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. That seems to make it clear that the Garda Commissioner is number one. It invites the possibility that the Director of Corporate Enforcement may want a matter handled in a particular way and the Garda officer may want to handle it differently and will seek the support of the commissioner or the higher ranks of the Garda Síochána to do it in the way the Garda wants. I am not judging which is better or worse as one cannot make that judgment without being familiar with the terms of the case in question. Subsections (1) and (2) do not seem to make it clear that the director is pre-eminent in terms of the investigation. Is the Minister of State consciously putting on record that in terms of personnel matters, to use a generic term he used, the Garda Commissioner has the ultimate call because I doubt if that is the case? I cannot find in the section where it states this power will be delegated to the director. I have no objection to the principle behind it but such clarity does not seem to be there.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill, members of the Garda Síochána, when carrying out an investigation, would act under the sole direction of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. They would carry out directions on the instructions of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and would act accordingly under this Bill once it becomes law. Gardaí would be seconded from the fraud bureau and a good working relationship between the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda authorities is necessary to ensure the Bill will have the full force of successful implementation once it becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A garda is under the direction and control of the commissioner but would be under the specific direction of the director in relation to specific functions of the direction under section 12(4). In other words, once assigned, they would be under the control of the director, but as members of the Garda Síochána the commissioner is responsible for them, for their welfare and personnel matters. <Col N="569" /> Their secondment to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement would not debar them from applying for promotion in the Garda Síochána. As seconded members of the Garda Síochána to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, they would be entitled to anything from which members of the Garda Síochána would benefit.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to dwell overly long on this matter as we dealt with it on Committee Stage. The amendment caters for the possibility that there may be some cases where substitution of the director for the Minister might be appropriate.

      <P>This amendment relates to section 14 which provides for the transfer to the Director of Corporate Enforcement of certain functions currently performed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Section 14(5) provides that notwithstanding the transfer of functions, legal proceedings in which the Minister is a defendant and which relate to a function transferred to the director shall continue in the name of the Minister and shall not be taken against the director. This is a standard provision which is intended to ensure that the director does not have to defend legal actions taken against the Minister arising from the performance by the Minister of functions subsequently transferred to the director.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that the provision whereby the director would not be substituted for the Minister in respect of legal proceedings pending against the Minister should be subject to the power of the court hearing the proceedings to order otherwise. This would have the potential to leave the director in the position of having to defend decisions of the Minister taken before the establishment of the office of the director. This could place the director in an invidious position as a result and the amendment is, therefore, not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Section 14(5) would not have the effect of preventing the court from making any order that it considered appropriate in respect of the functions or activities being carried out by the new director. This could be done without the court requiring to have the director substituted for the Minister as a defendant in the relevant proceedings which would be an inappropriate step to take.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13 to delete lines 18 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15.&ndash;Neither the Director nor any officer of the Director shall be liable in damages in respect of any thing done or omitted to be done in good faith by him or her in the performance or purported performance of a function under the Companies Acts or any other Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 15 provides immunity from civil and criminal proceedings for the Director of Corporate Enforcement or an officer of the director in respect of anything done in good faith in the performance of the functions of the director. This provision for immunity was included on the basis that the director and his or her staff should receive protection from being held personally responsible for acts done in good faith in the course of the performance of their professional duties.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage concern was expressed that this provision went too far in protecting the director and his or her staff, particularly in so far as it provides for immunity from criminal prosecution. Taking the concerns of the select committee into consideration and having sought legal advice on the matter, I propose an amendment to section 15. The revised section no longer requires immunity from criminal prosecution. Instead it provides a form of indemnity against losses arising from civil actions taken against the director or his or her staff in respect of acts done in the course of their official duties. I have been advised that in the absence of strong policy grounds for a wide level of immunity this is the appropriate form of protection for the director and his or her staff, which will ensure that they can carry out their functions in the knowledge that they will not be liable in respect of civil actions taken against them in a personal capacity once they acted in good faith.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes the deletion of section 15 in its entirety. I do not consider this appropriate in view of the provisions of the replacement section being inserted by this amendment. While I agree that criminal immunity would not be appropriate in respect of the director and his or her staff, a provision for civil indemnity is warranted and justified and I hope it meets the satisfaction of Deputy Rabbitte and other Members of the House.</P>

      <P>This is a considerable improvement and it is right that the director and his staff <Col N="571" /> ought to be indemnified. That was the argument I advanced on Committee Stage. To give a general immunity was too sweeping, more especially as it seemed to essentially consist of an exemption from the criminal law. This civil provision is entirely proper. I agree with the Minister of State that it is superior to excising the section which is proposed in my amendment, which has acted as a spur to release the creative juices in the Minister of State's Department which has come forward with an amendment which improves the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 29 to 51, and in page 14, to delete lines 1 to 6, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A report under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall include information in such form and about such matters as the Minister may direct but nothing in that or this subsection shall be construed as requiring the Director to include in such a report information the inclusion of which therein would, in the opinion of the Director, be likely to prejudice the performance by him or her of any of his or her functions.</P>
      <P>(3) The Director shall furnish to the Minister such information about the performance of the Director's functions as the Minister may from time to time require (other than information the provision of which under this subsection would, in the opinion of the Director, be likely to prejudice the performance by him or her of any of his or her functions).</P>
      <P>(4) When so requested, the Director shall account to an appropriately established Committee of either House of the Oireachtas for the performance of his or her functions but in discharging his or her duties under this subsection the Director shall not be required to furnish any information or answer any questions the furnishing or answering of which would, in the opinion of the Director, be likely to prejudice the performance by him or her of any of his or her functions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 deals with the reporting arrangements for the Director of Corporate Enforcement both to the Minister and to the Oireachtas generally. On Committee Stage the issues of independence <Col N="572" /> and accountability of the director were debated and, in particular, the extent to which the director may provide information in relation to specific cases investigated by him or her in the course of meeting his or her reporting and accountability obligations.  The select committee felt that the limitations on what the director could report to the Minister and to the Oireachtas generally were too severe. Accordingly, as the Tánaiste agreed, the wording of the section has been considered and a number of amendments are now proposed. The amendments will enable the Minister and the Oireachtas to request information from the director on the performance of his or her functions and other activities and the director must furnish the information requested unless in his or her opinion the performance of his or her functions would be prejudiced in any way. It is important that the question of whether particular information is to be disclosed should be a matter for the director who is in the best position to judge whether disclosure would prejudice an investigation or otherwise breach the confidentiality of information available to him or her.</P>
    <P>The replacement of subsection (2) relates to the annual report that the director is required to provide to the Minister while the replacement of subsection (3) deals with periodical reports that may be requested by the Minister from time to time in relation to the performance by the director of his or her functions. In each case the Minister is empowered to require the director to provide certain information relating to the performance of the director's functions and the director is required to furnish the information requested. The exception is where the director believes that the provision of the information would prejudice the performance of those functions.</P>
    <P>The replacement subsection (4) concerns the director's responsibility to account to the Oireachtas through an appropriately established committee for the performance of his or her functions. Members felt the published text of subsection (4) was too restrictive in terms of the director's discretion to disclose information to an Oireachtas committee. In the Bill, as published, subsection (4) precluded the director from divulging any information specific to matters investigated or prosecuted. One of the main concerns of the select committee was that Oireachtas Members might have access to less information on ongoing investigations than they have under the present arrangements. The proposed replacement subsection (4) will enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to question the director on the progress of any of his or her investigations without compromising the conduct of those investigations. These amendments improve section 16 and strike the right balance between accountability and operational independence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, tabled by Deputy Naughten, provide for the provision by the director of progress reports on outstanding investigations both to the Minister and the Oireachtas. The revised subsections (3) and (4) contained in amendment No. 6 adequately cover this point. They will allow the director to furnish any information concerning ongoing investigations, including progress reports, subject to the proviso that the furnishing of the relevant information would not prejudice the investigations.</P>
    <P>Members will also note that this amendment provides for the deletion of subsection (5) of section 16. That subsection provides for an amendment of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. The effect of the amendment was to exempt the Director of Corporate Enforcement from the provisions of the compellability legislation. In the light of our proposed amendment of section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, whereby information obtained by the Director of Corporate Enforcement under section 19 of that Act may be disclosed to a committee with powers under the compellability legislation, I no longer consider it appropriate that the director should be outside the scope of that Act. I propose, therefore, to delete subsection (5) of section 16 and trust this meets with the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for tabling this amendment. It is a dramatic improvement of the legislation and returns some powers to this House. It is important not to continue on the course we have followed in the past in drafting legislation whereby we deny ourselves the ability to access information. The prime example is the National Roads Authority. The Minister of State and I are abused in our respective constituencies because we cannot get answers from the National Roads Authority. It is another quango. I hope there will be a change in the future and these bodies will become answerable to both this House and committees of the House. We had the same problem with the Director of Corporate Enforcement who refused to come before some of the committees. I hope this will not happen under future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Ceann Comhairle is present for this debate. He is the individual who will be responsible for interpreting this legislation following its enactment. Will the Minister of State clarify that on the enactment of this legislation we will no longer encounter the situation we have encountered many times in the past where parliamentary questions are ruled out of order because the Minister has no responsibility to the House in relation to the matter? Parliamentary questions are still a key tool for Members in eliciting information and it is clear from the proceedings in the tribunals of inquiry that the lack of answers to <Col N="574" /> parliamentary questions and the lack of information provided for the House led to the establishment of those tribunals.</P>
    <P>At the end of each subsection the following phrase is used: &ldquo;. . .  would, in the opinion of the Director, be likely to prejudice the performance by him or her of any of his or her functions&rdquo;. I question the use of the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo;. In my amendments I used the phrase &ldquo;. . . that any such report shall not prejudice the investigation&rdquo;. It could be the case that the Director of Corporate Enforcement by furnishing information to the House to the effect that he or she has not performed to the best of his or her ability, could damage his or her reputation in relation to the performance of his or her functions at a future date. It is important to clarify the position in this regard and what is meant by the use of the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If, for example, information is sought by a Member of the House in a parliamentary question and a significant amount of time is required to compile the information requested, that would limit the performance of the office of the director because a member of staff would have to be assigned to compile the required data. Can the director refuse to furnish the Member and the House with that information because it would prejudice the performance of the office? That is the problem with using the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;. Nobody wants investigations to be prejudiced because of a request for information. That is not the case at present. Members can elicit a certain amount of information from the Tánaiste. We can see what progress is being made and question her about delays in pursuing cases without referring to specifics. I hope that will continue to be the case with regard to the director.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that the director cannot be questioned by an Oireachtas committee about an investigation. Will the Minister confirm this? If so, it means that in the case of an investigation which was initiated two or three years prior to the director coming before the committee, the members of the committee cannot ask the director what progress has been made to date or the reason it has taken so long to get that far without a conclusion being reached. It is important that the director should be able to furnish such information to the committee and be answerable to it in that regard. It would not prejudice the investigation.</P>
    <P>We are trying to achieve a balance where there will be accountability to the House to ensure the director fulfills his or her functions in a proper manner while not prejudicing a particular investigation that might be ongoing. Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify the issues I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the amendment is a significant streamlining of the Bill. However, I <Col N="575" /> wish to focus on subsection (5) which is excised by the Minister of State's amendment. In his reply the Minister might remind me, in layman's English, of the connection between that and amendment No. 18 in respect of the compellability Act.</P>
      <P>Subsections (4) and (5) stand alone. Does the constraint in subsection (4) govern subsection (5)? I am referring to the question of the director discharging his accountability function subject to it not impinging on confidentiality in terms of work he is undertaking. Does this govern subsection (5)? Subsection (5) is excised and means that, for example, all committees of the House would theoretically be in the same position as the Committee of Public Accounts. That committee was in the original legislation which falls with the excision of subsection (5). All committees of the House may now seek, under the compellability legislation, compellability powers if they go through the proper procedure, ending in the compellability sub-committee conferring the powers on the committee for a stated purpose.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights was investigating a particular matter, had jumped through all the hurdles in terms of the compellability Act and had received sanction to engage in such an inquiry with the power to send for persons, papers, documents, and to compel witnesses. Would any area of the director's investigation be sealed off from the committee? If it asked the director, who might coincidentally be looking at the same area of who might have information pertinent to the inquiry being engaged in by the committee, is there any area which would be ring fenced? I raise this in the context of, for example, subsection (4) which says the director has to discharge his accountability functions to a committee of the Oireachtas, provided it &ldquo;shall not impinge on the obligation of confidentiality attendant on the performance of the functions of the Director and the Director shall not divulge any information specific to matters investigated or prosecuted by the Director or likely to prejudice any such investigation or prosecution&rdquo;. It is feasible that there could be a tribunal of inquiry sitting at the time a committee of the House was examining similar terrain. What will happen if the director is conducting an investigation while a similar investigation is being conducted by a committee of the House? Will the director be obliged to furnish information to the committee if it writes to him on an order for discovery of documents which the committee believes he has in his possession? What will happen if the committee requires the director to appear before it? What exactly is the extent of the constraints on him in complying with the order for discovery from the committee?</P>

      <P>The job description is very similar to that of the DPP. The annual report of the DPP two years ago was the first such report published. Under this Bill the Minister may determine the type of information which the director can include in the annual report, but the Minister may not direct the inclusion of such information in the report as to derogate from the independence of the director, and perhaps the Minister will explain this.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to deal with non-compliance and the failure of companies to meet their obligations under the companies legislation. There are thousands of companies, with new ones being formed every week, and there is a significant task involved in policing them. The Companies' Registration Office deals with policing. What level of staff does the Minister think will be involved in minor non-compliance cases? The Garda Síochána will be involved in serious non-compliance cases.</P>
      <P>The DPP must be exempted in order to protect the confidentiality of information, and the position of the director under this Bill seems similar. The DPP has not been to committees of this House too often. Perhaps the Minister will clarify if this appointment is similar in status to that of the DPP. I note the 1997 Act will apply, which also applies in the office of the DPP.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides for the deletion of subsection (5) of section 16. That subsection provides for an amendment to the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, to which I have already referred. The effect of the amendment is to exempt the Director of Corporate Enforcement from the provisions of that Act. In light of the proposed amendment to section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, whereby information obtained by the Director of Corporate Enforcement under section (19) of that Act may be disclosed to a committee with powers under the compellability legislation, we no longer consider it appropriate that the director should be outside the scope of the compellability Act. In order to achieve that, I propose the deletion of section 16(5).</P>
      <P>Under amendment No. 18 the director will be required to provide information to an Oireachtas investigative committee. Deleting subsection (5) means that the director must appear. If the information can be shown as required by the Oireachtas committee, he must provide that information. Nothing is <i>ab initio</i> or ring fenced. In other words, he must respond in terms of whatever is put to him. The Oireachtas will have power to call the director before a committee and to require him or her to account for the performance of his or her functions and that of his or her staff. He will be required to attend and answer such questions.</P>

      <Col N="577" /> The Minister will still answer parliamentary questions as the responsible Minister, but clearly with the establishment of the office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Minister will not have knowledge of the detailed day to day activities of the director and his or her staff. Consequently it will be a matter either for the Deputy to communicate with the office of the director or through a committee to seek detailed information.</P>

      <P>I know that under the changes proposed the existing investigations shall remain under the control of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and so we can continue to question her about those. Any new investigations will be directly under the control of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Will it be possible to get the same level of information we are currently getting regarding the progress of these reports from the Director of Corporate Enforcement? Will the Director of Corporate Enforcement be obliged to give those answers to a committee of the House? Will the director be obliged to give that information to a Member of the House on the basis that it is a Member of this House who is requesting information?</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to return to one of my original questions about the ambiguity regarding the use of the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo;<i>versus</i> the word &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;. Will it leave the Director of Corporate Enforcement in a position where he may not furnish the information because the length of time it would take to compile the information would restrict the performance of that office? That is an important issue on which the Minister of State needs to give an answer. How does one define the term &ldquo;performance&rdquo;? It is like asking how long is a piece of string. That needs to be clarified. We all agree that the investigations cannot be prejudiced but the issue of performance needs to be clarified.</P>

The subsection (4) which will now be enshrined in the Bill will still provide that &ldquo;the Director shall not be required to furnish any information or answer any questions the furnishing or answering of which would, in the opinion of the Director, be likely to prejudice the performance by him or her of any of his or her functions.&rdquo;. Will the Minister of State relate that to the circumstances of amendment No. 18? If the director were before an inquiry, as envisaged in amendment No. 18, and he said, in answer to a question, that he had formed the opinion that it was likely to prejudice the performance of his duties, would that be the end of the road?</P>

      <Col N="578" /> Supposing the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunity of Witnesses) Act, 1997, were invoked and a committee were engaged in an inquiry, even on a matter already being investigated by the director. If the committee concerned asked the director for information, which certainly would be ruled out under the old subsection (4), is it now permissible for the director to furnish that information to the inquiring committee?</P>

      <P>A number of questions have been raised and I want to respond to them as best I can. To return to Deputy Perry's earlier question, the position of the director in this regard is not similar to that of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is a law officer of the State. The Director of Corporate Enforcement will be required to appear before Oireachtas committees whereas the DPP is not required to do so.</P>
      <P>On the various points raised, there was reference to amendment No. 18 again. The Director will be required to provide information to an Oireachtas committee of investigation and that is why we have deleted subsection (5). Unless reporting on progress would actually prejudice the investigation under way, which is highly unlikely, the director would have to give progress reports to the committee. He would have to respond to the committee but he would respond to an individual Deputy at his discretion &ndash; I am sure he would respond to an individual Deputy out of courtesy.</P>

    <P>The net point here is that I argued on Committee Stage that an amendment such as this may be required for constitutional reasons. Where a party applies to the court, the application must be given reasonable equality with the case for the defence. The certification here would seem to carry a presumption of additional evidence, by mere virtue of it being certified. On Committee Stage the Minister undertook to take advice on that point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 relates to a constitutional point in terms of the use of the word offender, that if it applied to a criminal offence, then the term offender is wrong and the words &ldquo;a person alleged to have so refused&rdquo; would be more appropriate. We discussed this on Committee Stage when the Tánaiste undertook to take advice on both points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 relate to section 23 of the Bill which provides for the amendment of section 10 of the Companies Act, 1990. Section 10 of that Act sets out the powers of High Court inspectors appointed under section 7 or 8 of the Act to investigate the affairs of a company. Among these powers is the power to require the production of documents, to require persons to attend for examination and to require them to answer questions put to them in the course of such an examination. Section 10(5) and (6) deals with the refusal or failure of a person to comply with the requirements imposed by court appointed inspectors. It provides that the inspectors may certify the refusal or failure to the court and that the court, having heard any evidence of witnesses offered on behalf of the person concerned, may make any order it deems appropriate. Such an order could be for the person to attend and answer the questions of the inspectors or, indeed, that the person need not do so. Subsection (5) makes reference to a person who has refused or failed to attend for examination or answer a question as the alleged offender. Deputy Rabbitte's proposed amendment, previously submitted on Committee Stage, seeks to change the reference from the person alleged to have so failed or refused on the basis that the use of the word &ldquo;offender&rdquo; was inappropriate in that refusal or failure to comply with a requirement of court appointed inspectors would not constitute an offence. The Tánaiste agreed to consider this amendment for Report Stage and having sought legal advice on it, I can now accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 11 proposed the deletion of the provision in section 10(5) whereby inspectors may certify the refusal or failure of a person to comply with their direc<Col N="581" /> tions on the basis that the provision of certificate evidence is not appropriate to a criminal matter. With the removal of the reference to an offender, section 10(5) and (6) no longer carries any criminal connotation and the provision whereby inspectors may certify certain facts to the court as appropriate means no amendment is therefore required or appropriate in respect of this element of section 10.</P>

I remain puzzled about the proposition concerning a party applying to the court whose application must be afforded reasonable equality with a defence. One cannot, therefore, have the applicant furnishing a certificate also and saying there is an assumption that that is tantamount to additional evidence. I am still a bit confused, even if we have removed it from the rubik of criminal connotation. I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 11.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 27, to delete &ldquo;(f)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(fb)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 13, 18 and 19 relate to the disclosure to the Oireachtas or a committee of the Oireachtas of information obtained by the director of corporate enforcement under section 19 or 20 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte proposed an amendment on Committee Stage to include the Oireachtas or a committee of the Oireachtas in the list of competent authorities to whom such disclosure would be permitted under section 21 of the 1990 Act. His amendment No. 19 would have that effect. While similar proposals have been rejected in the past on the grounds that they might unnecessarily damage the section 19 examination process, the Tánaiste indicated on Committee Stage that she was disposed to the provision of relevant information to an Oireachtas committee of inquiry <Col N="582" /> where this would facilitate the deliberations of such a committee.</P>
    <P>As already stated the Tánaiste would like to see the role of the Oireachtas enhanced regarding inquiries. Members of the Oireachtas have shown that they can act in a highly professional manner in the conduct of such inquiries as was evidenced in the Committee of Public Accounts DIRT inquiry. Having considered the matter carefully, amendment No. 18 is now proposed and provides that information obtained by the director of corporate enforcement under sections 19 and 20 of the Companies Acts may be made available to committees of the Oireachtas in particular circumstances. The circumstances are such that the committee in question must be one that has been granted powers under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability of Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. The information must be required for the performance by the relevant committee of its functions. I believe this represents a reasonable measure of disclosure that will facilitate the performance of their functions by relevant committees without the potential for damaging section 19 examinations that might result from open disclosure to the Oireachtas generally of information obtained under section 19.</P>
    <P>Consistent with this position, I also believe that the Director of Corporate Enforcement should, if required, attend before an Oireachtas committee that has been given compellability powers and give evidence that may assist the committee in carrying out its mandate. As I indicated earlier, an amendment was introduced to delete section 16(5) of this Bill which would have exempted the director from the provisions of the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 is a technical amendment to section 24 which provides for the amendment of section 11 of the Companies Act, 1990, dealing with reports of court appointed inspectors appointed under section 7 or 8 of that Act. This amendment is directly consequential upon amendment No. 18. Its effect is to update the cross reference in section 11 of the 1990 Act to section 21 of that Act to include reference to the new subsection (1)(fb) inserted in section 21 by this new amendment No. 18.</P>

      <P>I think we have established, for the record, that in the event of the director being required to appear before a committee in the circumstances here envisaged he would be required to answer any reasonable question put to him provided the committee was seen to be discharging its mandate. If such an investigation is carried out by a committee of the House under the compellability powers and that committee makes an order for discovery, is the director required to furnish the information sought in that order for discovery? There are several circumstances where a committee of the House may be <Col N="583" /> seized of an identical matter to that being investigated by the director. A committee of the House may not even know that the director is looking at the same area but may have reason to believe he has information pertinent to its inquiry. If an order for discovery is made by the committee, must it be complied with by the director?</P>

The advice of the parliamentary counsel is that this approach is not the correct one and any reference to a person that occurs in a gender specific Act should be in gender specific terms.

      <P>(<i>b</i>) subject to subsection (4), other books or documents which may relate to any books or documents of the body;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> (4) The power under subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) shall not be exercised unless&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) in the opinion of the Director, there are reasonable grounds for believing the first and second-mentioned books or documents in subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) are related to one another (and those grounds may include grounds related to the relationship between the body and the person of whom the requirement under subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) is proposed to be made, a common origin of some or all of the information contained in the said books or documents or similar considerations), and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) save where the Director is of opinion that compliance with this paragraph could result in the concealment, falsification, destruction or the disposal otherwise of the books or documents concerned, the Director notifies the person of whom the requirement under subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) is proposed to be made ('the third party') that the Director proposes to make that requirement and states in that notification the grounds for his opinion under paragraph (<i>a</i>) and that the third party may (if such is his contention) make submissions to the Director, within 21 days from the date of the making of the notification, as to why he believes the said opinion of the Director to be erroneous (and the Director shall have regard to any such submissions so made before finally deciding whether to make the said requirement or not),</P>
    <P>but in no case shall the third party be obliged to comply with such a requirement in relation to a particular book or document concerned if he would be entitled, by virtue of any rule of law or enactment, to refuse to produce, in any proceedings, the book or document on the ground of any privilege (whether the privilege to which section 23 applies or not).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for the repeal and substitution of section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, which provides for the examination of the books and documents of companies and other bodies. Section 19(3) provides that where the Director of Corporate Enforcement has the power to require the production of books and documents from any body he shall have the power to request their production from any person who appears to be in possession of them. On Committee Stage it was agreed to extend this subsection to cover books or documents also that may constitute copies of any books or documents of the body in question.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the further extension of this subsection to cover books or documents that appear to the Director of Corporate Enforcement to relate to books and documents of a body whose books are being examined <Col N="585" /> by the director. It has been the experience with a number of section 19 examinations that arrangements are often put in place to hide the company's true business by using intermediate vehicles, such as other companies and trusts. As the law stands it has not been possible to obtain the books and documents that these other companies or intermediate vehicles may have relating to the business of the target company. Thus, the progress of section 19 examinations has often been inhibited by a lack of adequate legal powers. The Bill addresses these weaknesses by providing for the production by any other bodies of documents relating to a body whose books and documents are under examination.</P>
    <P>This additional amendment now proposed for section 19(3) should significantly enhance the usefulness of section 19 examinations. Access to the personal or private documents of individuals who have been involved or who have done business with the body under examination may be essential if the director is to obtain meaningful information or evidence of how a body conducted its affairs. As the books and documents referred to in subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) are the personal and private documents of an individual, I also propose the introduction of a new subsection (4), which is designed to protect the individual's right to privacy. The new subsection will ensure that the power under subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) will only be exercised where the director has reasonable grounds for believing that the individual's books and documents relate to the books and documents of the body under examination. The director must notify the individual concerned of the reasons his or her books or documents are being requested for examination.</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides that where the individual concerned believes the director's reasons for forming his or her opinion are erroneous he or she can make representations to the director accordingly. Finally, the proposed subsection (4) provides for the individual referred to in subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) to be relieved from his or her obligation and to produce personal or private documents if he or she is entitled to do so under any legally recognised form of privilege.</P>
    <P>The new section 371A of the Companies Act, 1963, introduced by amendment No. 41, is intended to address a situation in which a person claims a privilege under section 19(3)(<i>b</i>) but the Director of Corporate Enforcement disputes this claim to privilege. In such circumstances the director may apply to the court to compel the person to comply with his or her demand for production of the books or documents in question. The court would, as part of hearing any such application, settle the question of whether the books or documents were privileged or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the recent state of the environment in which this legislation will oper<Col N="586" /> ate, I appreciate that the Department has a good deal of experience in terms of this kind of intermingling and interaction of companies, their books and documents as envisaged being related to the subject matter of inquiry. This amendment goes some way to meet the debate on Committee Stage, in so far as the director is required to have reasonable grounds for sequestering the additional books and information, referred to here as second mentioned documents and so on.</P>
      <P>There is also some relief in that, as I understand it, the company may make a submission within 21 days if it thinks the intrusion is unwarranted, unfair and not relevant. To some extent the fishing expedition that was originally envisaged as feasible has been constrained and the requirement of there being reasonable grounds for this kind of intrusion is an improvement. Presumably this matter has been finessed by the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Department in as far as it is likely to go.</P>
      <P>While the amendment is an improvement, there may still be casualties in that the director has the final say. If a person felt aggrieved that there was no reasonable grounds requiring him to produce additional documentation and made a submission to the director does the director sit in a quasi-judicial capacity and make the decision? Presumably the person could have ultimate recourse to the courts but in the first instance the director decides.</P>

In many cases third parties can be foreign registered companies or companies that have been taken off the shelf, as has been shown in relation to the ongoing investigations in the Department where foreign registered companies have been used as the third parties. What is the position regarding the disclosure of information from these companies if they are outside the jurisdiction of this State and the EU?</P>
      <P>What controls or powers are there to ensure that information is furnished to the Director of Corporate Enforcement or is it the case that the director would have to fight a case under the legislation prevailing in other jurisdictions?

      <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Rabbitte, the director has the final say but the person could seek judicial review. If an individual refuses to comply with the wishes of the director the director can go to court to force that decision. Alternatively, if the individual is not satisfied to comply or believes he is being unfairly treated he can seek a judicial review and can go to court requesting the court to prevent the director from procuring the relevant information.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Naughten about the enforcement of judgments orders within the European Union, I expect the Director of Corporate Enforcement will have some powers. However, I doubt he will have any powers outside the European Union. It would be a matter for him to seek information through the courts in foreign jurisdictions. As we know, this is not easy to procure and the risks and costs involved are high. A judgment call would have to be made at the time.</P>
      <P>If a company is carrying on business in Ireland, it must provide the information under the Bill when it is enacted. There is provision for getting assistance from other company law authorities in other jurisdictions and we will expect and seek their support. Partnerships could develop where they might request information about individuals operating through companies in this country and <i>vice versa.</i> I am sure it will be possible to reach an arrangement in certain instances. However, the legislation would not have a mandate in foreign jurisdictions. Co-operation may be the order of the day, particularly between the police services. The fact that members of the Garda Síochána will be members of the office of corporate enforcement will ensure that there is a better chance of procuring information.</P>

    <P>As we are aware, there are difficulties with regard to the Competition Authority, which is a similar body under the umbrella of the Department. Up to recently, it had not functioned for the previous year or 18 months because it did not have the resources to recruit staff. If somebody made a complaint, he or she received a letter from the Competition Authority stating that an investigation could not be considered due to a lack of resources and staff. Will the Minister give <Col N="588" /> a commitment that whatever resources are required will be provided by the Department if the Director of Corporate Enforcement believes the office has a valid case to make in one of the countries involving information that is vital in relation to taking a successful case against a company in this jurisdiction?</P>

      <P>In page 28, to delete lines 37 to 45 and page 29, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following &ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The amendments made by paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of subsection (1) shall not have effect in relation to a declaration under subsection (1) of section 150 of the Act of 1990 made before the commencement of this section and, accordingly, the requirements of subsection (3) of that section 150 that shall apply in respect of a person who is the subject of such a declaration made before that commencement shall be those that applied before that commencement.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 41 of the Bill amends section 150 of the Companies Act, 1990, by increasing the amount of share capital that a company is required to hold where one or more of the directors of the company is subject to a restriction order under that section. The amounts in question are to be increased in the case of a private company from £20,000 to £50,000 and in the case of a public company from £100,000 to £250,000. The increases in these amounts are intended to ensure that companies that have restricted persons among their directors have adequate share capital to meet prospective debts in the more buoyant economy that now obtains compared to the period when the figures were set out ten years ago.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, we introduced an amendment that provided for transitional arrangements in respect of existing companies that currently have restricted directors. This would give these companies six months to raise the required additional share capital. The increased levels would have immediate effect for companies whose directors are restricted post commencement of the new provisions. Deputy Rabbitte proposed an amendment to this amendment, seeking to remove the retrospective nature of the provision by having the increased share capital imposed only on companies whose directors are restricted by orders made post commencement of the section and to exempt companies who currently have restricted persons among their directors. This amendment has been resubmitted as amendment No. 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the points made on Committee Stage, I have reconsidered the matter and tabled amendment No. 21. In essence, I agree with Deputy Rabbitte's view that the increased share capital requirement should only apply to companies whose directors include a person or persons who have been restricted by the court subsequent <Col N="590" /> to the commencement of section 41. The amendment provides for this by limiting the application of the increased share capital amounts to orders for restriction made after the commencement of the section.</P>

      <P>Section 42 of the Bill amends section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990, which deals with the disqualification of persons from being directors or other officers of companies. The amendment clarifies the power of the court to make a disqualification order in respect of a person who is disqualified in another state.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, an amendment to section 160 of the 1990 Act was introduced to include a provision whereby a person who is disqualified in another jurisdiction from being appointed or acting as a director or secretary of a company may, if the court considers it just, also be disqualified in this jurisdiction. Deputy Rabbitte tabled an amendment to this on Committee Stage to provide that the court, prior to making a disqualification order, must be satisfied that the conduct of the person that occasioned the foreign disqualification would, had it occurred here, been such as to warrant disqualification. This proposal has been resubmitted as amendment No. 24.</P>
      <P>I agree that Deputy Rabbitte's amendment would help to clarify the power of the court to make a disqualification order. Having consulted the parliamentary counsel, I propose amendment No. 23 which takes on board the Deputy's suggestion. It was the intention of the relevant Government amendment on Committee Stage that a disqualification order would only be made against a person on the basis of a foreign disqualification in a case where the court considered that the actions that occasioned that foreign disqualification would also warrant disqualification here. However, the amendment leaves no doubt about the power of the court in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 42 of the Bill which provides for the amendment of section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990. Section 160 deals with the disqualification of persons from being directors or other officers of companies. Paragraph (b) of section 42 of the Bill amends section 160 to provide that a court may order the disqualification of a person on the basis that he or she was a director of a company that was struck off the register for failure to file an annual return. The primary reason for this is to discourage abuse of the strike off procedure by directors of companies seeking to frustrate creditors from securing payment of debts. When a company is struck off the register it ceases to exist as a legal entity and creditors must have the company restored to the register before they can pursue payment of their debts through the courts or have the company wound up either by the court or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Section 42 paragraph (<i>c</i>) amends section 160 of the 1990 Act further to provide that the court shall not make a disqualification order against a person on the grounds that he or she was a director of a company that was struck off for failure to file if the court is satisfied that the company in question either had no liabilities when it was struck off or that any such liabilities have since been discharged.</P>
      <P>As the purpose of providing for disqualification of directors in these cases is to prevent companies from seeking to evade their liabilities, it is reasonable to remove the possibility of disqualification where there are no liabilities or where the liabilities have been discharged. Deputy Rabbitte's amendment seeks to limit the matter to a consideration of net liabilities only. On the face of it this may seem reasonable, as virtually all companies have some liabilities, but in most cases these will, I hope, be outweighed by assets and the company would, therefore, have no net liabilities.</P>

      <P>I will conclude with just a couple of sentences for the benefit of Deputy Rabbitte who asked me to refer to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> It is these very cases that the amendment to section 168 seeks to address. It is in circumstances where a company, despite having liabilities, has sufficient assets to discharge those liabilities that the striking off of the company is particularly deleterious to the creditors' interests as their rightful entitlement to a share of the assets of the company is frustrated by the fact that the company no longer exists in law. It is, therefore, important that the provision whereby the directors may be disqualified in such cases is retained, whereas the Deputy's amendment would remove this. Another important factor is that simply because a company does not have net liabilities does not mean it will discharge the liabilities it has. Allowing the company to be struck off the register by failing to file an annual return may be part of a strategy on the part of the directors to have the company avoid discharging its liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time now, we in Dungarvan have been worried about the future of our two American factories which belong to multinational companies. A series of mergers and buy-outs has caused this worry. The original Smith Kline Beecham company merged late last year with another pharmaceutical giant, Glaxo Wellcome, to form the conglomerate GlaxoSmithKline. Just down the road we have the Stafford Miller branch of another multinational. The owners of this group, the Bloch family, let it be known last year that they were anxious to sell their enterprise worldwide </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Stafford Miller international operation, which manufacturer the toothpaste, Sensodyne, and other dental products, was by pure coincidence purchased by GlaxoSmithKline. We had, therefore, two multinationals merging within a few hundred yards of each other. Obviously we were apprehensive about developments. We feared that as a result of these changes there might be some form of rationalisation in one of the plants in Dungarvan and so it transpired last Thursday with the announcement that the operations of the Dungarvan branch of the Stafford <Col N="593" /> Miller company would be transferred to Maidenhead in England with the loss of 104 jobs.</P>
    <P>Please note that there has always been a first class working relationship between workers and management at the factory and that the lay-offs are due to what the principals described as the restructuring of their operations. There have not been industrial problems at the factory in question and certainly no disputes.</P>
    <P>Dungarvan is the county town of Waterford. It has its own industrial base which was dependent on four factories, two of which I have mentioned, GlaxoSmithKline and Stafford Miller. Waterford Glass or, as it is known locally, Dungarvan Crystal, is the third and the fourth is Waterford Foods. However, two years ago the town suffered a very serious blow when the indigenous industry of Waterford Foods closed down with the loss of 400 jobs. This is the most established industry in the town. Between those 400 job losses and the 104 in Stafford Miller, we have lost more than 500 jobs, which is a great deal in a relatively small provincial town.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in conjunction with IDA Ireland, to direct her efforts towards the establishment of new industry in Dungarvan, be it one large scale factory or a series of smaller units. IDA Ireland has a 36 acre land bank in the town and with the construction of the state-of-the-art Waterford treatment plant imminent, the site will be suitable for a wide range of industries. It would also be appreciated if the Minister would agree to meet the four Deputies from the Waterford constituency in the next few days to discuss the problems arising from this setback in the town bearing in mind the comments she made over the weekend regarding the job losses at Stafford Miller.</P>
    <P>When questioned about the announcement last Thursday the Tánaiste commented that the news was a particular blow to an area of the State that had not fared as well as others in attracting new industries. That statement speaks for itself. The Tánaiste is aware that we suffered a massive loss when Waterford Foods closed down. We now have an additional loss. IDA Ireland and other State agencies have not been successful in attracting new industries to the town. The Tánaiste has acknowledged that and I ask that she meets us and IDA Ireland immediately to discuss the problem and try to rectify it as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I share fully his disappointment at the announcement of the loss of 108 jobs at the Stafford Miller plant in Dungarvan, County Waterford. Stafford Miller is a wholly owned subsidiary of Block Drug Company Inc. which was <Col N="594" /> recently acquired by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). GSK employs a total of 1,350 people between its Dublin, Cork and Dungarvan facilities. There are currently 381 people employed by the company in its Stafford Miller factory in Dungarvan.</P>
      <P>GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of reviewing worldwide operations in light of the merger between Glaxo Wellcome and Smithkline Beecham. On foot of this, a decision has been taken to transfer the manufacturing operations for toothpaste out of Dungarvan to the GSK facility in Maidenhead in England and to increase production of Poligrip denture fixative at the Dungarvan plant. Regrettably, the net result of this is a loss of 108 jobs in Dungarvan. These will be by way of voluntary redundancies and I understand that they will not take place until well into 2002. The company has committed itself to providing outreach support for those who opt for redundancy. None of the other GSK units operating in Ireland is affected by the announcement.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these losses, however, the consolidation of worldwide Poligrip manufacture in Dungarvan and the positioning of the plant as a focused denture care facility will provide a platform for future growth. The key objective now is to ensure that alternative employment is found for those workers who are to lose their jobs over the next year. FÁS has already been in touch with the human resources manager of GlaxoSmithKline, with a view to offering the full range of FÁS services to the workers who will be affected by redundancy.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland remains committed to the promotion and development of Dungarvan and of County Waterford. Its strategy is to focus on the growth sectors of international services, pharmaceuticals and information and communications technologies for new greenfield investment and to work with existing overseas companies to win expansions. However, there have been a number of positive developments in Waterford in recent times. In January last, the Tánaiste announced that Sun Life Information Services Ireland Limited, a member of the Sun Life Financial of Canada group of companies, will create 200 new jobs in Waterford city over the next four years with the establishment of a business support centre, which will be a key element in supporting the company's growing business in the US. Sun Life is a diversified international financial services organisation, focused on providing financial solutions to businesses and individuals. It already has an information technology services centre in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month, the Tánaiste announced that Waterford is to be the location for a significant new investment project in the biotechnology sector with the potential to create 480 new jobs. Genzyme Corporation of Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, one of the largest independent pharmaceutical-biotechnology companies in the world, plans to establish, with the support of IDA <Col N="595" /> Ireland, a new manufacturing facility on a 32 acre site in Waterford. The facility will be the initial project in a manufacturing investment envisioned by Genzyme that could reach 250 million and have the potential for creating up to 480 new jobs over five years. Genzyme will locate in an existing building formerly occupied by Luxottica-Rayban at the IDA Ireland Business Park in Waterford. The facility will be converted and used in the manufacture of Renagel tablets, a product used in the treatment of patients with kidney disease who are on dialysis. This project will be a high quality, high value operation and will have a major impact in Waterford. This is a strong endorsement by a world class company that Waterford can offer enormous opportunities to investors.</P>
    <P>In Dungarvan, IDA Ireland is actively promoting the 27,000 square foot advance factory provided by Irish Business Against Litter &ndash; IBAL. This is an adaptable, well positioned building and the new entrance road, which is now completed, will be an important factor in attracting a suitable client as access to the site has presented difficulties in the past. IDA Ireland has also recently acquired a 35 acre site in Dungarvan which is located adjacent to the existing IDA Ireland industrial estate. Agreement has been reached with Waterford County Council on plans to develop the site and work is set to begin shortly.</P>

Century Homes, an Enterprise Ireland company, has commenced production in the advance factory in Dungarvan. It manufactures timber frame houses and will employ 70 people over the next few years. The factory will be expanded in autumn 2001. Earlier this year, the Tánaiste established a group representing all relevant interests under the banner &ldquo;Strategy Waterford&rdquo; in recognition of Waterford's failure to achieve the same success as other major urban centres. The members are representative of business, local government, community groups and trade unions supported by the Government's development agencies. This group will play a very important role in developing Waterford as a key location for new business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, IDA Ireland's south-east regional office is located in Waterford city and this is soon to be expanded with a team of ten key executives headed by a senior manager. This team will have responsibility for some of IDA Ireland's critical target sectors for investment &ndash; information and communications technologies and engineering. It is envisaged that this new presence and focus will <Col N="596" /> drive growth across the region and allow the city to become a magnet for development in the south-east. This special focus by IDA Ireland will be of major benefit to Dungarvan with its excellent infrastructure, schools, housing and vibrant business environment. I will take Deputy Deasy's message to the Tánaiste in the morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this most important issue on the Adjournment tonight. I propose to share time with my constituency colleague, Deputy McGahon, with the agreement of the House.</P>
      <P>Just a short few years ago, there was a great welcome for the Xerox plant when it was established in Dundalk. A very significant business park was developed at the south end of the town and one of the largest industrial projects ever in Dundalk was set up.</P>
      <P>The recent announcement of the closure of the ink-jet sector came as a major shock to those who were looking forward with significant confidence to the further expansion of the plant and to the employment of a greater number of people. The announcement rocked the locality and confidence was quite clearly affected. Many people have been looking forward to expansion and not to retrenchment.</P>
      <P>We are at a stage now when there is an urgent need to reassure the remaining workforce in the plant. Many of those left other employments to come home to work in their native town. Many employees who have lost their jobs or are facing the threat of losing their jobs in the next few weeks would in normal circumstances have the commitment of house mortgages and the normal commitments of marriage and home establishment. They are now looking for reassurance both in the short and long-term. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, can give that assurance. It is important that the industry is in a position to consolidate in Dundalk. We hope that such consolidation will lead to further growth.</P>
      <P>Dundalk has taken a very severe battering over the years because of its proximity to the Border and the difficulties we have had to deal with over the last 30 years. We all hoped that when Xerox came to the town we had really turned the corner and we saw it as a clear indication of confidence in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for sharing his time. This is a matter of grave concern to both of us. The loss of manufacturing jobs in County <Col N="597" /> Louth, and particularly in Dundalk, has now become a serious crisis. Manufacturing industry in Dundalk has suffered badly in recent times, especially with the loss of 400 jobs in Xerox. I will not draw any graphic descriptions of the devastation, suffice to say that there are 400 families in shock in Dundalk tonight. Many of those families have taken out mortgages and do not know what the future holds for them. My concern is that an American company could come to Dundalk and inculcate such expectancy in the workers of Dundalk, and then within two years, that company is letting go 400 people.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say how much Irish money was invested in this company and what research was done into the viability of that company before Irish money was granted? The dogs in the street all around the world know that the Xerox company is in serious trouble in America where it has been threatened with bankruptcy. State money was donated, with the best of intentions. It was given a 100 acre site and Louth County Council provided the best of facilities, discommoding many people in Dundalk in the process. This was an ailing company before it came.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that enough research was done by IDA Ireland despite its desire to attract a major industry to Dundalk. It is well known Xerox was ailing and threatened with bankruptcy. The likelihood is that it will go bankrupt in America. If that happens the entire plant in Dundalk will close and at what cost to the taxpayer? I wish this company survival. I applaud the Government for making it attractive for it to come to Dundalk but I am deeply concerned at the amount of money spent on attracting an ailing industry. Can this company come clean with its workers who are still there? Can it be honest with the Government but more particularly with the unfortunate workers who do not know what tomorrow will bring?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Xerox Corporation is the world's sixth largest information technology company. It is a public company, quoted on the New York stock exchange. Headquartered in Stamford, Con<Col N="598" /> necticut, it currently employs more than 90,000 people worldwide and is one of the leading document processing companies in the world. It develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of products, including copiers, printers, scanners, fax machines and document management software, to facilitate the flow of information from paper to electronic form and back to paper again.</P>
    <P>Xerox Europe, the European operations of Xerox Corporation, markets Xerox products, solutions and services throughout Europe and employs 16,000 people. The company has advanced research and development centres in Cambridge in the United Kingdom and Grenoble in France. It has manufacturing operations in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Holland. The 110 acre Xerox technology park at Dundalk is one of its manufacturing facilities. This 500,000 square foot facility manufactures colour toner, inkjet printer cartridges, inkjet printer heads, power supplies, electronic assemblies, as well as undertaking software development. Its current employment in Dundalk is 900 people.</P>
    <P>Xerox Corporation has been experiencing poor financial performance in recent times. Revenues for year end 31 December 2000 were £15.58 billion with losses of £214 million. In the first quarter of 2001, revenues were £3.5 billion, down 13% from the equivalent period in 2000.</P>
    <P>Xerox is engaged in a review of asset dispositions, as a key element of a plan to restore a sound financial foundation to the business. The company has also undertaken an internal reorganisation and major cost reduction programme. The completion of the sale of its China operations in December 2000 to Fuji Xerox, its Japanese joint venture partner, was the first of such disposals. A partner was being sought for its inkjet business. However, while the company was engaged in active discussions with potential equity partners, the slowdown in the economy and its impact on the PC and SOHO &ndash; small office and home office &ndash; markets, prevented these companies from making what had been considered an attractive investment in Xerox's SOHO business.</P>
    <P>In the first quarter of 2001, the company recorded an $82 million pre-tax loss in its small office-home office business. Revenues for SOHO were $139 million, representing 3% of total first quarter revenues. Xerox expects its second quarter pre-tax SOHO operating loss to be similar to the first quarter.</P>
    <P>On 14 June, Xerox announced its plans to exit from its SOHO business segment in a move designed to sharpen the company's focus and support its turn-around strategy. It will discontinue its line of personal inkjet products, sold primarily through retail channels. As the inkjet product line is a significant part of the Xerox campus at Dundalk there will be an impact there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> Xerox's Dublin operations at Ballycoolin Business Park in Blanchardstown, include financial services, technical support and customer support operations for the European market. Xerox employs 1,500 people in Dublin. This operation will not be affected by the job losses at Dundalk announced on 14 June last. The company is trying to minimise the number of jobs affected by the decision in relation to its inkjet business. The inktank business will be maintained for the time being.</P>
    <P>Xerox and IDA Ireland have met at high level and discussions are continuing. Xerox has assured IDA Ireland of its willingness to work with IDA Ireland to find an alternative project for the Dundalk workers affected. IDA Ireland has an unique track record in all parts of the world in securing outstanding foreign direct multinational companies for Ireland. Key arrangements are made, commitments are entered into and must be honoured. In any negotiations with a company IDA Ireland will ensure all commitments are fulfilled to the absolute conclusion.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Beef Labelling.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of compulsory labelling for EU beef which will be complete by next year is welcome. It is one of the vital steps required to ensure traceability and confidence in beef. However, the extent of the labelling being proposed does not go far enough. Beef labelling is being introduced here as a result of EU regulations, the purpose of which is to establish traceability, thus ensuring that the information is accurate and verifiable. These regulations simply provide for minimum standards. In this context it is disappointing that the Government appears to be happy to accept these minimum standards as the maximum that the consumer should expect. As an economy which depends heavily on the food industry we should enhance these standards to ensure the consumer is fully informed and that traceability is extensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to introducing standards in the Irish food industry, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development insists on waiting for EU advice. This lax approach to taking a lead in food safety and standards was evident to me on a number of occasions. An example of this was when I asked the Minister if he would impose a permanent ban on the use of meat and bonemeal. His answer was that he would deal with these issues once EU regulations were effective for both labelling and a meat and bonemeal ban. As the guardian of our food industry the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should make key decisions about standards and quality in an effort to make the food on our shelves safe. He should not have to <Col N="600" /> wait until the EU sets out minimum guidelines but should take the lead.</P>
    <P>According to the information available to me on the proposed labelling system, beef which is included as part of a ready meal or a processed product will not have to be labelled. Given that there is a stronger association between BSE and meat products which may contain traces of specified risk material or which may derive from older cattle, it is incredible that products like meat pies, burgers and sausages will not be labelled. If anything should be labelled it should be these types of foods.</P>
    <P>Another critical feature of this new scheme is that it does not apply to meat or meat products which have been brought into Ireland from outside the EU. We already know that non-EU countries are experiencing BSE and if the consumer is to have confidence in beef there should not be any anomalies or gaps. Regardless of its origin all beef in shops, restaurants or other food outlets should be labelled and traceable.</P>
    <P>During the past week households throughout the country have been receiving information on beef labelling by way of a Bord Bia glossy leaflet. Unfortunately, this leaflet does not provide sufficient assurances that all beef on our plate is safe. The leaflet raises more questions than it answers. Will the Minister ensure that at a minimum all beef offered for sale in Ireland, whether fresh, frozen, processed or used in the catering industry, can be traced to source?</P>
    <P>The recent foot and mouth disease crisis should be enough to convince all of us that traceability is crucial to the safety of our food and the integrity of our markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue. Traceability is of the utmost importance in providing consumers with the necessary assurance, in relation to the food, which they are offered.</P>
      <P>We are committed to increasing the level of traceability of the foodstuffs that we produce, as evidenced by our cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, and by the introduction this week of the national sheep identification system, NSIS. We play a full and committed role at EU level in advancing this issue and we are very much of the view that demands for traceability must be every bit as applicable to third countries as to EU producers.</P>
      <P>Traceability is particularly relevant in the context of the foot and mouth disease crisis, which has affected the agricultural sector and many other sectors of our national economy in an unprecedented way over the past four months.</P>
      <P>It is now some considerable time, since the one and only case of foot and mouth disease in this country was confirmed in Proleek in County Louth on 22 March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> Thankfully we are now approaching a point, when a significant degree of normality can return to the agricultural sector, and the reopening of the marts on Monday last, 18 June, was perhaps the most significant step yet in the phased return to normal business, as far as the livestock sector is concerned.</P>
    <P>Our neighbours in the United Kingdom have not been as fortunate as us, however. More than 1,700 cases have to date been confirmed in Great Britain and, even now, they are averaging about three or four new cases every day there. We have not yet reached the stage, therefore, where we can relax our guard completely and we must remain on alert, until we are certain they have had their last case in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We have all seen in graphic detail the trail of devastation left by foot and mouth disease across the United Kingdom and the very significant social, economic, environmental and political fall-out from the disease outbreak there. Equally the consequences of just a single outbreak here helped to place the possible consequences of further outbreaks in perspective.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that here parties of all political persuasion, Government and semi-State organisations, sporting, social and business organisations and individual members of the public across every section of society have made a tremendous contribution to our national success in the combined fight against foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>As a Government, we owe it to all of those involved in this effort to absorb the lessons of foot and mouth disease and to adapt our policies in light of the events of the past four months. Recent experience has also pointed to the need for tighter legislative controls in certain areas.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has already put through a major amendment to the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, conferring significant new powers on his authorised officers, creating new offences, with significant penalties of fines of up to £100,000, or five years imprisonment, or both and providing for the seizure of assets, including animals, vehicles and buildings used in the commission of offences under the Act. This is very significant and far-reaching legislation and will prove a valuable addition to existing controls.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated to the Council of Agriculture Ministers, on a number of occasions, that lessons also need to be learned at European level. On two occasions in the recent past, serious animal disease outbreaks in the UK &ndash; of classical swine fever and foot and mouth disease &ndash; have been attributed to infected animal based products imported from third countries.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly time to re-examine the controls operated by third countries in this area to ensure that they are at least equivalent to those operating in the European Union. I do not agree <Col N="602" /> with those who might suggest that we should close our doors to third country produce. As a small, open economy we simply cannot afford to take this approach in dealing with third countries and those who might suggest otherwise are simply not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that our citizens are entitled to expect that food safety and traceability standards in third countries are equivalent to those upon which we quite rightly insist from our neighbours in Europe. A considerable body of regulation already exists in this area.</P>
    <P>In the case of the labelling of beef and beef products, the European Union adopted regulations last year to introduce compulsory labelling of beef at all stages of production and marketing, up to and including the final point of sale to the consumer. The regulations in question are the European Parliament and Council Regulation No. 1760/2000 of 17 July 2000, which establishes a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and the labelling of beef and beef products and the Commission Regulation No. 1825/2000 of 25 August 2000, which lays down detailed rules for the application of this system.</P>
    <P>Under these regulations, operators or organisations involved in the production and marketing of beef are, since 1 September 2000, required to label it with the following information: a reference number or code, which enables the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located; and the approval number of the de-boning hall and member state or third country in which it is located.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 2002, operators and organisations marketing beef should, in addition, indicate on the label information concerning origin, in particular where the animal or animals from which the beef was derived were born, fattened and slaughtered. These regulations, which are fully enforced in Ireland have direct legal effect in all member states of the European Union, which are also required to enforce them in full.</P>
    <P>The compulsory beef labelling system also applies to beef and beef products imported into the European Union. To ensure that the labelling arrangements relating to imported beef are of equivalent reliability to those applicable to Community beef, the EU Commission examines notifications received from third countries. Once the Commission is satisfied the procedures and/or criteria applied in the third country concerned are equivalent to those obtaining in the EU, it transmits notifications to the member states. To guarantee the reliability of the labelling system in third countries, the Commission may request additional information, while it may also carry out checks in the third country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> In relation to other animal based products, the country of origin and the establishment in which the product was produced must be approved in advance by the EU Commission. Granting of approval is dependent on such factors as the animal health status of the country, adequacy of its veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices. Third country production plants are inspected by veterinary experts from the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission before approval is given.</P>
    <P>On arrival in the EU, third country product is subject to official inspection at the first port of arrival. This includes checks on accompanying documents and on identity and labelling, as well as random physical checks on the product itself. If these checks indicate that everything is in order importation is authorised and thereafter the product may circulate freely. It must be borne in mind that particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU.</P>
    <P>In addition the products must comply with the packing and labelling requirements laid down in EU legislation. The requirements are that the consignment bears a health mark that includes the initials of the exporting country and the approval number of the consigning establishment on each sealed package. The marking must be with a health mark in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive No. 71/118/EC.</P>
    <P>These measures constitute an essential control on the importation of animal products from third countries. However, it is clear that in light of recent events they need to be re-examined in a fundamental way and that the Commission needs to refocus its attention to some extent on the potential threat to animal and human health from third country imports.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has made his views on this issue quite clear to his European colleagues and he will continue to press for a review of all of the controls in this area as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I trust this puts the matter in perspective for the Deputy who has a very particular personal interest in the matter, which I value very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, he cannot look after industry and commerce, agriculture and now health. However, I know he will handle it to the best of his ability.</P>
      <P>A number of incidents have recently been brought to my attention about the anti-social behaviour of tenants who are in receipt of rent supplement. When I investigated the matter, I found out from the health board that those tenants could be in receipt of up to 90% of the rent of the house and yet the health board has no responsibility concerning the social behaviour of those tenants.</P>
      <P>This is in contrast to local authority tenants who are subject to the controls of the local authority and if they engage in unsocial behaviour they can be punished with eviction. However, if tenants receiving rent subsidy are engaged in unsocial behaviour, the health board has no come back. The rent supplements cannot be withheld from those people. The only way to bring landlords and tenants to their senses would be to introduce a regulation &ndash; and the last regulations were in 1995-96. A regulation should be introduced giving health boards the same powers with regard to people receiving rent supplement as local authorities have over tenants in their houses.</P>
      <P>I know that the vast majority of people receiving rent supplements behave in a correct social manner. However, there is a minority that is making life hell for their neighbours by keeping animals in their back gardens and playing loud music all night totally disregarding their neighbours, including children who are in the middle of their exams. I know of cases in Galway city where neighbours of people behaving like this had to move out of their houses and rent elsewhere. A regulation should be introduced so that there is some control over these people.</P>
      <P>In the Western Health Board area in 2000 some £11.2 million was paid out in rent supplements. That would build a significant number of houses in that area. We are not getting good value for money in the manner in which that scheme is being administered.</P>
      <P>There is another anomaly whereby there is an advantage to a person receiving rent supplement compared with a local authority tenant. For example, a widow with only a widow's pension living in a local authority one-bedroom house pays rent of more than £14 each week. A similar person renting a one-bedroom apartment and getting rent supplement only pays £6 on top of the rent supplement that they receive. The only way to correct this serious anomaly is to introduce a regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contacted the Western Health Board and was told that it had no jurisdiction and that unsocial behaviour is a matter for the Garda. I know that unsocial behaviour is a matter for the law, but <Col N="605" /> there must be some regulation. If the landlord is in some other county or in some other country, he does not care about behaviour if he is getting his rent every week. However if he got the penalty of the rent supplement being cut for two, three or four weeks in the case of proven unsocial behaviour, then that landlord would not be long coming home and sorting out the problem.</P>
    <P>Communities are suffering great disruption and tension. People are suffering great stress, upset and worry on account of this. On the first occasion they approach the offending neighbour and ask for music to be turned down or to have dogs put in the back yard, it will be done. However, on the second occasion, tension arises and it only leads to a worse problem. We have had a very serious problem in a housing estate in Galway last week where a young boy from a neighbouring house was hospitalised as a result of the unsocial behaviour of people in that type of scenario. The Minister should address this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue on behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who is unable to be with us this evening. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs by the health boards and the Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various conditions for receipt of rent supplement are set out in Part III of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations, 1995, to which Deputy McCormack has referred. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent. In practice, most recipients contribute more than £6 per week towards their rent because their weekly social welfare payment is above the standard SWA rate. For example, single persons on long-term unemployment assistance pay £7.50 per week towards their rent, a lone parent with two children on one<Col N="606" /> parent family payment pays £11.50 per week towards rent and a single person on retirement pension pays £22 per week towards rent.</P>
    <P>SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent or mortgage interest supplement recipients to retain their housing supplement as an in-work benefit on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions. For example, people on approved employment schemes, such as community employment, can retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. The supplement is withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year 1, 50% in year 2, 25% in year 3 and 25% in year 4.</P>
    <P>In accordance with regulations, participants in community employment and back to work schemes are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements already described or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of SWA, whichever is the greater. The regulations to which I referred earlier also require each health board to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, for example, single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc, as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area and are reviewed regularly.</P>
    <P>These SWA income maintenance payments deal with the symptoms of the problem but it is also necessary to deal with the underlying imbalances in the overall housing system. As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure that the best possible housing options are made available to people with long-term housing needs, many of whom currently rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement. In that regard, I understand the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will bring detailed proposals to Government shortly. In addition, a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is currently under way. All aspects of the scheme will be examined, including the arrangements governing payment of rent supplements.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to the serious problems narrated by Deputy McCormack pertaining to the situation in Galway city. I have no doubt those problems exist in many other towns and cities across the country. It is a matter we <Col N="607" /> should address seriously to see what can be done to ensure there is equity in the regulations and that the rule of law prevails for everybody, including those who pay for their private accommodation through mortgages and hard work and those who benefit from the State as a result of the resources we make available. I will bring the sentiments expressed by the Deputy to the attention of both the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 70 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to record my satisfaction with the outcome of the referendum on 7 June 2001 on the death penalty. The outcome clearly demonstrates the opposition of the people to the use of the death penalty in this country. The consistent view of the Government has been and is one of total opposition to the use of the death penalty. The Deputy will be aware of the efforts we have made, in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, to seek its universal abolition.</P>
      <P>The EU guidelines, adopted in 1998, set out clearly the common EU position on the use of the death penalty. The US authorities, at both state and federal level, have been frequently lobbied on the use of the death penalty. They have been made aware in numerous <i>démarches</i> of Ireland's and the EU's opposition to the death penalty in all cases and of our view that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. Where the facts of individual cases suggest a violation of basic minimum standards under international law, the EU considers making a specific intervention. The Government is strongly of the view that an EU intervention carries significantly greater force than individual bilateral interventions by national Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month the Swedish Presidency in Washington delivered a general <i>démarche</i> on the death <Col N="610" /> penalty to the State Department, along lines agreed by all partners, including Ireland. The EU's support of the principle of maintaining the <i>de facto</i> moratorium on the use of the federal death penalty was also reiterated. We will continue to engage in a dialogue with the US authorities to seek abolition of the death penalty and are seeking in the interim the introduction of moratoria at state level and the reintroduction of the <i>de facto</i> moratorium at federal level. Internationally we will continue our efforts, with our EU partners, to seek the universal abolition of the death penalty.</P>

      <P>In November 1998, the UN General Assembly expressed its firm determination to facilitate and promote dialogue among civilisations and decided to proclaim the year 2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilisations. Subsequently, an Eminent Persons Group was tasked by the UN Secretary General with preparing a report on the issue which will be presented at the 2001 session of the United Nations General Assembly. The group is composed in the main of political figures and academics, each of whom has been individually invited to participate by the Secretary General. It is intended that the report will outline the main components of a new paradigm of international relations.</P>
      <P>At the request of UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and his personal representative, Giandomenico Picco, the Government hosted a meeting in Dublin on 30-31 May of the Eminent Persons Group. Members of the group travelled from various parts of the world, including Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and the United States. The meeting, which was attended by officials of my Department in an observer capacity, focused on drafting the report and in particular on chapters concerning the relationship of globalisation to the concept of a dialogue among civilisations. The emerging international relations scenario foreseen by the group is one in which dialogue is used to manage diversity and to lay the groundwork for a peaceful future for all the peoples of the world. The aim is to produce a text which will be read both by policy makers and members of the public and which will appeal in particular to young people.</P>
      <P>The meeting was a useful contribution to the work of the Eminent Persons Group and the Government's invitation was highly appreciated by both the UN secretariat and the eminent persons themselves. I look forward to the successful outcome of this project at the General Assembly next December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply which I provided to an almost identical question in this House on 28 November last. I am, of course, happy to recapitulate the points which I made then and in particular to reiterate that the information which the Deputy has requested relating to formal Council meetings is already available in the public domain.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 16 Council formations at present, some of which meet as often as 12 times per year. Irish Ministers and Ministers of State attend the various Council meetings according to their areas of functional responsibility. Following each Council meeting, a comprehensive Council press release is issued which gives the venue, a list of those attending from each member state and full details of the agenda. These press releases are, of course, available in the public domain. Each one issued since 1 January 1995 can be accessed on the EUROPA website. I can provide the precise website address if required.</P>
      <P>Once every six months, the Presidency-in-office invites the Ministers attending individual Council formations to an informal gathering. These meetings take place in the country holding the Presidency. They serve the useful function of allowing EU Ministers to confer informally, often about longer term and strategic issues, without the pressure of more immediate work which can often dominate Council agendas. There are no agendas for informal meetings. No formal business is transacted and no conclusions are adopted.</P>
      <P>I have attended informal meetings of Foreign Ministers, known as &ldquo;Gymnich&rdquo; meetings, on two occasions since my appointment. At the first such meeting, held at the Azores on 6-7 May 2000, Ministers discussed the future of Europe, the western Balkans, expenditure on the EU's foreign policy priorities, European security and defence policy, Austria, the situation in Zimbabwe, the next EuroMed ministerial meeting, developments in Sierra Leone, EU-Turkey relations and Russia. At the Gymnich meeting held at Evian Les Bains, France on 2-3 September 2000, Ministers discussed the future of Europe, the Middle East peace process, the EU's external relations and the western Balkans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of an injury received in a minor traffic accident, I was unfortunately unable to attend the Gymnich meeting in Nykoping, Sweden on 5-6 May this year. I understand that Ministers discussed enlargement, the two Koreas, the Middle East, western Balkans and the EU's <Col N="612" /> approach to human rights. EU Foreign Ministers were joined for lunch on 6 May by Foreign Ministers for the candidate countries for a discussion on the future of Europe.</P>
    <P>My predecessor also attended informal meetings of EU Foreign Ministers at Mondorf-le-Bains, Luxembourg in October 1997, Edinburgh in March 1998, Salzberg in September 1998, Reinharthausen, Germany in March 1999 and Saarriselka, Finland in September 1999.</P>
    <P>With regard to informal gatherings attended by other Ministers, invitations are normally issued directly by the chairman in office of each such Council formation to the relevant Irish Minister. By their nature, such meetings are conducted through informal procedures, without the direct involvement of my Department. Should the Deputy require information about the attendance of Ministers other than those for Foreign Affairs, he might direct his question to each of the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the latest US and UK initiative on Iraq at the UN Security Council is a genuine attempt to resolve the humanitarian crisis in that country; and if the Government has made alternative proposals at the Security Council on the issue.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has consistently made clear its grave concern about the humanitarian situation in Iraq. It therefore welcomes the initiative by Britain and the United States for changes to the operation of the UN sanctions regime on Iraq. In our view the new proposals appear to be a major step in the right direction. We are examining those proposals closely and are playing an active and constructive role in the negotiations in the Security Council where agreement on a new resolution is required by the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to their initiative, I have written to US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and the British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, outlining the concern of the Government to achieve a resolution which will provide, to the fullest extent possible, for the normalisation and development of the Iraqi economy for the benefit of the people <Col N="613" /> of Iraq. This would include normal trade in civilian goods and the restoration of Iraq's infrastructure and production capacity, while maintaining those controls essential to prevent the Iraqi regime from developing weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>In addition to the current British-US proposals, which focus on a revised system for the importation of goods into Iraq, Ireland has proposed further measures to permit foreign investment and international service contracts, within the context of effective weapons control. I am hopeful that because of our efforts these issues will be addressed in the final resolution. The existing British-US proposals involve a reversal of the underlying concept of how the sanctions regime operates. It would no longer be the case that all imports must be authorised and every import contract assessed to establish that it has no military use. Rather, all goods will be allowed into Iraq except those items specified on a goods review list. The current system of 180 day distribution plans to be agreed between the Government of Iraq and the UN would no longer be required.</P>
    <P>The content of the goods review list is a vital element of the current negotiations. In my view the list should be as precise as possible and be limited to those dual use items that have a clear military application. As important is the manner in which the list will be applied by the 661 committee. In order to achieve the humanitarian objectives shared by all members of the Security Council, I see it as crucial for the 661 committee not to act in an excessively restrictive way. This is a particular concern which I have raised in my letters to the US Secretary of State and the British Foreign Secretary. Items on the list should not be blocked if they are verifiably being imported for specific civilian use. This is especially the case for needed infrastructural projects in Iraq. These projects should not be prevented, restricted or delayed simply because a constituent item required for the project appears in the list. I am hopeful that in the final resolution agreement will also be reached on the procedures for dealing with contract applications to leave as little room as possible for ambiguity.</P>

      <P>The Government condemns in the strongest possible <Col N="614" /> terms the cowardly practice of &ldquo;exiling&rdquo; by paramilitary groups. No-one from any community in Northern Ireland has a mandate to engage in such acts of violence or intimidation. The Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island, North and South, recognised the right of citizens to freely choose their place of residence. It is imperative that this right be protected and vindicated throughout Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We discuss this issue with the British authorities on an ongoing basis through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. They have confirmed that no figures are available on the numbers of people actually forced to leave Northern Ireland as a result of paramilitary &ldquo;exiling&rdquo;. The Government continues to urge all parties with influence on the perpetrators to use their best endeavours to end this practice and to allow those already &ldquo;exiled&rdquo; to return safely to their homes.</P>

      <Quest>his response to the call made by Trócaire that the Government should use its influence within the EU and the UN to halt western investment in the oil fields in Sudan in view of allegations that oil companies have been complicit in serious human rights abuses in the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The initiative launched by Trócaire and other European NGOs is a welcome development that will help heighten public awareness of the situation in Sudan. I share many of their concerns and am pleased that officials from my Department recently met with representatives from Trócaire to discuss the role of oil companies in the conflict.</P>
      <P>The Government's deep concern at the ongoing civil war in Sudan and the enormous humanitarian toll it has taken on its people is a matter of record. We have repeatedly articulated these concerns in public and privately. I believe that the most effective way to improve the human rights situation and ease the terrible suffering of the population is to end the protracted civil war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, through its membership of the European Union and the IGAD partners forum, has actively sought to encourage meaningful negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive peaceful settlement in accordance with the agreed declaration of principles. While progress has been difficult to achieve, there have been some significant developments over the past month. On 2 June, a meeting took place in Nairobi between the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, and John Garang of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, SPLA, the first such summit meeting between the two leaders since 1997. The progress achieved at this summit was limited, but it did represent an important first <Col N="615" /> step in reinvigorating the long stalled peace process and must be built upon in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>On 24 May, the Government of Sudan announced a cessation of its air strikes in the south of the country and in the Nuba mountains. This initiative was regrettably reversed last week following an escalation of military activity by the SPLA. In a statement issued on 12 June, Ireland joined our EU colleagues in calling on both parties to halt their military activity and urged the Government of Sudan to fully honour its commitment to end aerial bombings in the south. It is essential that this renewed hostility is not permitted to reverse the tentative progress achieved on the political front.</P>
    <P>The EU and the Sudanese Government have been conducting a renewed dialogue for the past 18 months. Within the context of these discussions, the EU has raised a wide range of concerns relating to human rights, the humanitarian situation and the conduct of the war. Oil related issues have become an increasingly important element in this dialogue. In response to the concerns expressed by NGOs and international organisations, an EU delegation made an informal visit to a number of oilfields in Sudan in May. The visit took place within the framework of the EU-Sudan dialogue and was an attempt to obtain a first hand impression of the humanitarian situation in the oil concession areas. The delegation visited a number of locations in South Kordofan and Unity State and met with a wide range of representatives from UN agencies, NGOs, local representatives of civil society and representatives from the oil companies. They were not accompanied by Sudanese Government officials.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that revenues from the production of oil play an important role in helping to finance the war in Sudan. It is regrettable that few of the profits from oil are reinvested in the oil producing areas, a point emphasised by the EU delegation following its visit. We have raised these concerns with our EU colleagues and have urged that efforts be made to ensure that companies operating in the country comply with international best practice. We will continue to insist that oil related matters remain a priority within the EU-Sudan dialogue and will support efforts aimed at ending the prolonged civil war.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Security Council has very specific responsibilities for the maintenance of peace and international security. The issues raised by the Deputy are not dealt with directly by the Security <Col N="616" /> Council but are pursued on a thematic basis and, in the Security Council, in the context of specific situations. For example, sanctions are in place with the specific aim of reducing the flow of arms to a number of conflict areas.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is also illicit trafficking in arms and this is often linked to illegal trade in high value commodities, such as so-called blood diamonds and other natural resources. This link often leads to the exacerbation of conflicts, particularly in Africa. Both aspects of this problem are now being addressed. The UN conference on the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons in all its aspects will take place in New York next July with the objective of agreeing an international action plan in order to combat this illicit trafficking. The Irish delegation is already fully engaged in the preparatory work. The trade in high value natural resources and commodities is also being addressed especially in areas which suffer from persistent conflict, such as Angola and Sierra Leone.</P>
      <P>In the case of Angola, Ireland, as a member of the UN Security Council, is playing a very active role through its chairmanship of the United Nations Sanctions Committee Against UNITA, Angola. The sanctions have an important role to play in bringing the tragic conflict in Angola to an end and I am determined to ensure that they are fully implemented. So far as Sierra Leone and Liberia are concerned, Ireland, as vice-chair of the Liberian sanctions committee, is also playing an active role. Security Council sanctions against Liberia came into effect on Monday, 7 May, and we will work to help ensure their full implementation and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>In all our efforts on these important issues we remain conscious of the commitment made by the leaders of all UN member states on the occasion of the millennium summit in New York last September. The declaration which they made, <i>inter alia</i>, addressed the interrelated issues of development, peace, security and disarmament, and specifically the need to implement treaties in arms control and disarmament, to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and to end illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons.</P>
      <P>In compliance with these undertakings, the UN Secretary General is preparing a progress report on implementation for consideration at the next regular session of the General Assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has on a number of occasions expressed its concerns about the deaths and serious injuries which have resulted from the use of PBRs in Northern Ireland. Since their introduction in 1973, 14 people have been killed by PBRs and many hundreds have been injured. Prior to that, three people died as a result of rubber bullets. We have consistently urged the need for stricter controls and maximum restraint to curtail the use of these bullets to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>The Patten Report acknowledged the concerns about PBRs and, although it did not recommend an outright ban at that stage, the report did express a desire to &ldquo;see the use of PBRs discontinued as soon as possible&rdquo;. Patten made a number of recommendations about their deployment and use and also specifically recommended that &ldquo;an immediate and substantial investment be made in a research programme to find an acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternative to the PBR&rdquo;. The British Government accepted these recommendations and initiated the research project in July 2000. We want to see a speedy conclusion of this project.</P>
      <P>Against this background, concerns have been expressed about the introduction of a new and potentially more lethal PBR from 1 June. In April, the Taoiseach said that &ldquo;the Government have grave reservations about the proposed introduction of a new form of plastic bullet, which can be even more lethal to certain vulnerable parts of the body like the head&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The clear spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten Report is that PBRs should be phased out, not renewed or replaced in a different format. Our very serious concerns about the new PBR have been raised with the British authorities through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We welcome, however, the measures introduced since August 1999 by the British Government to limit the use of plastic bullets, including by restricting their deployment to a reduced number of specially trained and authorised officers.</P>
      <P>I should note that there has been a relatively low incidence of PBR usage in Northern Ireland over the past year and a half: more than 6,000 were used in 1996 contrasting with a figure of 26 in 2000 and nine so far this year. It is vital that this trend continues and that the use of PBRs be kept to the absolute minimum in the coming months, with a view to eliminating their use entirely as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any incidents of anti-Irish racism in Britain must be seen in the context of the greatly improved climate of Irish-British relations in recent years. The significant contribution of members of the Irish community there to the political, economic, social and cultural life of Britain is now fully recognised and appreciated by the British Government, as recorded by Prime Minister Blair in his address to the Houses of the Oireachtas in November 1998 and exemplified by his attendance at a recent London reception of the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain and the presence of the Home Secretary and the Northern Ireland Secretary at the federation's congress in Sheffield this past weekend.</P>
      <P>This acknowledgement by the British authorities of the contribution of Irish people to society there is accompanied by acknowledgement that some of our community continue to encounter discrimination and disadvantage. A report in 1997 for the Commission for Racial Equality examined the extent of discrimination against the Irish community in Britain and how it affected many areas of people's lives. The report contained recommendations to Government agencies, statutory bodies, voluntary organisations and private companies about combating anti-Irish discrimination. The then British Home Secretary welcomed the raising of awareness of the issues covered by the commission's report and undertook to ensure that the concerns mentioned in it would be given proper attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Through the embassy in London the Irish Government also welcomed the report's highlighting of the problem of discrimination and we expressed support for the remedial action recommended. The embassy, in conjunction with the Federation of Irish Societies and other Irish organisations in Britain, is promoting and monitoring action to put into practice the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>Following representations by the embassy in support of it, one of the key recommendations &ndash; that the separate ethnicity of Irish people be recognised by the inclusion of an Irish ethnic category in the census of population &ndash; has been implemented in respect of England and Wales in the April 2001 census. This gives a lead to official bodies generally to monitor and give particular attention to services for the Irish community.</P>
    <P>The Home Secretary has responsibility for British Government policy in this area and the Commission for Racial Equality is the only Government body with the statutory power to enforce the Race Relations Act. Discrimination and disadvantage are as repugnant to the British Government as they are to us. We remind them of the importance of sensitivity by public authorities towards the distinctive social and cultural characteristics of the Irish people with whom they have dealings.</P>

      <Quest>whether multilateral agencies, of which Ireland is a member, are funding the building of a dam which represents a major threat to the Kurdish people and the record of their civilisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Ilisu dam forms part of the South-East Anatolia project in Turkey. The dam generates hydro-electricity from the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris in the predominantly Kurdish region of Turkey. The South-East Anatolia project, which has an anticipated completion date in 2010, involves more than 20 major dams, including the Ilisu facility, 19 hydroelectric plants and dozens of irrigation systems. The Ilisu dam itself is on the River Tigris close to the frontier with Syria and Iraq, and is currently the largest hydropower project in Turkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Kurdish and nongovernmental sources, such as Friends of the Earth, the South-East Anatolia project has resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of local people. The Ilisu dam reservoir will flood 15 towns, more than 50 villages and is expected to displace about 20,000 people. A major concern has been the <Col N="621" /> alleged lack of compensation for the affected Kurdish population and reportedly inadequate consultation over resettlement.</P>
    <P>Concerns have also been voiced over the consequences of the dam for the Kurdish people's cultural heritage. The reservoir will flood Hasankeyf, one of the oldest settlements in the world and a site of great archaeological significance.</P>
    <P>The World Bank has declined to fund the Ilisu dam or indeed the other aspects of the overall South-East Anatolia project. The bank had a number of serious reservations in relation to the project, including political sensitivities.</P>
    <P>The potential for friction between Turkey and neighbouring Iraq and Syria over the transboundary use of waterways has also given cause for concern. In 1997 Turkey was one of only three out of 133 countries to reject the UN's Convention on Transboundary Waterways, which aims to minimise the negative impact of waterway development projects on neighbouring states. The River Tigris flows into Iraq and Syria about 40 miles from the Ilisu dam. There are concerns that the project will impact negatively on the quantity and quality of water reaching these neighbouring states.</P>
    <P>The World Bank is a co-founder of the World Commission on Dams which it established with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 1997. Its overall mission is to review the performance of large dams and make recommendations for future planning of water and energy projects. In November 2000, the World Commission on Dams published its report, which was sponsored by the World Bank, on a three-year global investigation into dam building. The report, which was launched by former South African President, Nelson Mandela, World Bank President, James Wolfensohn, and UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, is an indictment of past dam-building standards and calls for the application of much tougher financial, environmental and social guidelines in the future. The report found large dam projects in the developing world often cause more misery than benefit for the impoverished peoples affected by them, and has recommended sweeping, participatory changes in the way dam proposals are evaluated.</P>
    <P>Because of its high-level backing and the emphasis on the adverse social and environmental impact of many dam and hydro-electric schemes, the report will be interpreted as also putting increased pressure on major dam-building countries to do more to respond to the demands of their critics.</P>
    <P>The World Bank is providing almost no money for new dam projects &ndash; indeed it now funds less than 1% of the large dam projects that are under way around the world. Instead, it has refocused its resources on dam rehabilitation and safety.</P>

      <P>As I have said before, punishment beatings, shootings and acts of intimidation are totally unacceptable and have no place in a democratic society. The Government has consistently called for an immediate end to all such acts of violence or intimidation and our position has been communicated to those parties with influence on paramilitary organisations.</P>
      <P>The statistics available show there has been an increase of nearly 40% in the number of &ldquo;paramilitary-punishment attacks&rdquo; to date this year in comparison with the same period in 2000. Since 1 January last, 164 punishment attacks have been recorded &ndash; 102 have been attributed to loyalist paramilitaries and 62 have been attributed to republican paramilitaries. Given the nature of these attacks, these official figures probably understate the full extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>The Government deplores this upward trend and once again calls on those parties who may have influence with paramilitary organisations to help bring these attacks to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>First, I refer the Deputies to the reply I have given to the priority question on the same matter, the text of which was as follows. The reports to which the Deputy is referring relate to our programme in Kilosa in Tanzania. The facts of the matter are these. Our head of mission at our embassy in Dar-es-Salaam was advised that our monitoring and accounting systems were indicating that an amount of funds provided to our area based programme in Kilosa in Tanzania was not properly accounted for. He ordered an independent investigation which verified insufficient accounting for some procurements and tenders, the total of which could reach £50,000. I should mention that our total programme in Tanzania this year is £13.5 million.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the results of the investigation, the head of mission went to Kilosa where he laid the information before a public session of the Kilosa District Council and demanded immediate action. His statement was picked up by the local media which presented it as the proper assertive approach for a donor friend of Tanzania to take. This was taken up in turn by the national media which took a similar line. This is the source of the information picked up in Ireland by a Sunday newspaper.</P>
      <P>The current position is that six senior officials have been suspended and that a police investigation has been initiated with a view to bringing charges against those suspected of corruption. The responsible Tanzanian Government Minister is engaged on the matter and determined to see a full and thorough investigation. Our main focus is to seek to have the funds properly accounted for. If funds are indeed proven to be missing, we do also have the option of off-setting such an amount against further assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> The important point to make is that our oversight systems do work, even in an environment like Kilosa, where poverty and weak governance are features. The Deputy will, I think, further appreciate that in pursuing this matter in so public a manner we are determined to demonstrate not only that these systems work but that they are seen to work.</P>
    <P>However, the reality of development aid is that the environment in which all aid programmes operate is one where the issues of good governance and responsible public administration are themselves development issues. It is a fact that weakness in these areas is always present where there is poverty. Within Ireland Aid every effort is made to put in place systems to guard against malfeasance. For example, in the six priority countries in Africa, where the greater part of bilateral assistance is concentrated, the six missions together with all of the accounts under their control are subject to annual external audit by reputable international accounting firms. Additionally, where there are area based programmes, like those in Kilosa, and sector support programmes in the country programmes in these priority countries, they too are subject to annual audit. There are qualified accounting staff in all of the missions in the priority countries. In two of the countries, where there are sizeable programmes, there is a second accountant.</P>
    <P>Overall it is important to note that appropriate monitoring and accountability mechanisms are in place; the issues of governance and accountability are central to our dialogue with our partner Governments in Africa; where incidents of this kind occur, proper action is taken, lessons are learned and new precedents set; and that we work closely on all issues of development co-operation, including accountability, with other bilateral and multilateral donors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 95 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that the proposals put forward on missile defence are of a general nature. The US Administration has yet not made clear its thinking on a number of specific aspects but it is clear that the current administration <Col N="625" /> intends to pursue the missile defence option. In line with an earlier commitment to consult with its allies and other interested parties, the US is now involved in a process of such consultation. We understand that President Bush last week discussed this with his allies in NATO and with President Putin of the Russian Federation whom he met in Slovenia.</P>
    <P>The declared intention of the US Administration to reduce further its stockpile of nuclear warheads is, in itself, positive. The previous Administration accepted last year at the United Nations General Assembly the objective put forward by Ireland, together with its partners in the New Agenda Coalition, of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Any genuine progress in this direction would of course be a constructive step.</P>
    <P>The Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, has served the world well as a cornerstone of nuclear arms reductions and as a central element in diminishing the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war. In this regard, it can be seen as a vital framework until such time as nuclear weapons have been eliminated.</P>
    <P>President Bush has made it clear that he does not regard the ABM Treaty as relevant to what he describes as &ldquo;the new strategic environment&rdquo; and he has also made it clear that the United States sees a need &ldquo;to move beyond the constraints&rdquo; of the ABM Treaty. I would be extremely concerned if this could lead to the ending of the ABM Treaty and the consequential destabilisation of the present nuclear balance. This could result in a renewed nuclear weapons arms race and the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is for this reason that Ireland has supported resolutions at the two most recent sessions of the UN General Assembly on the need to uphold the existing framework of the ABM Treaty and in the context of plans leading to the elimination of the nuclear arsenals.</P>
    <P>At the fifth review conference of the states parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last year, the 187 states parties, including the five nuclear weapons states, agreed &ldquo;that the ABM Treaty be strengthened as a cornerstone of strategic stability and as a basis for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons&rdquo;. It is our hope therefore that the Bush Administration will have regard to the commitment which was undertaken by the United States at the Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently opposed any moves which might undermine the current balance of strategic stability. The Government continues to work in all appropriate fora to achieve the objectives of its disarmament policy in relation to weapons of mass destruction. Our views and concerns on this matter have been and continue to be communicated to the Bush Administration in all our contacts.</P>

      <P>I discussed the situation in the Middle East with my EU colleagues at the meeting of the European Council in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June. The Council gave its full support to the recommendations of the Mitchell report, which we believe provide the best basis for the resumption of the peace process. We welcomed the Palestinian-Israeli security plan, which commits the parties to end violence and the lifting of internal closures. The Council stated that it is essential to agree rapidly on the steps to be taken and on a timetable for their full implementation. The Council also called for a complete freezing of settlements activity. A cooling off period should start as soon as possible in order to allow for the implementation of additional confidence building measures and a resumption of full and meaningful final status negotiations on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>The case relates to the situation in northern Cyprus since the invasion of that territory by Turkey in 1974 and the continuing division of the island of Cyprus. The issue at stake was the accountability of Turkey for violations of the European Convention on Human Rights occurring in northern Cyprus. Cyprus contended that, notwithstanding the establishment of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in November 1983, Turkey remained accountable under the convention on the grounds that the TRNC was an illegal <Col N="628" /> entity and is not recognised by the international community. Turkey maintains that the TRNC is a democratic and constitutional state and is politically independent of all other states, including Turkey, and that allegations of human rights abuses made by Cyprus were imputable exclusively to the TRNC.</P>
      <P>The application by Cyprus was lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights in 1994 and was declared admissible on 28 June 1996. In June 1999, the commission reported that there was no basis on which a friendly settlement of the issues could be secured and referred the matter to the court in September 1999.</P>
      <P>In a judgment delivered in Strasbourg on 10 May 2001, the court held, by 16 votes to one, that the matters complained of by Cyprus in its application entailed Turkey's responsibility under the European Convention on Human Rights. In all, the court held that there had been 14 violations of the convention. Details of the very lengthy decision can be found on the court's internet website &ndash; ttp://www.echr.coe.int.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government with regard to the Cyprus problem is not affected by the decision of the court, which is binding on the parties concerned. Ireland recognises the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the sole and legitimate Government of the island of Cyprus. We believe that this decision, which is consistent with previous decisions of the court in relation to the status of Cyprus, re-emphasises the need for a resolution of the problem of Cyprus. In this regard, Ireland supports the efforts of the UN Secretary General in the search for a political solution based on a bicommunal, bizonal and federal approach.</P>

      <P>Further to its commitment to meet the UN overseas development assistance target of 0.7% of GNP by the year 2007, the Government has appointed a 15-person Ireland Aid Review Committee chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for overseas development assistance and human rights, Deputy O'Donnell. The review committee has been tasked by the Government to examine and assess the future role and management of Ireland Aid in <Col N="629" /> responding to humanitarian crises and in helping to advance the objectives of poverty alleviation, sustainable development and the integration into the world economy of developing countries.</P>
      <P>The establishment of this review process reflects the reality that the Government's planned four-fold expansion of Ireland's overseas aid budget, to a figure in the region of £800 million by the year 2007, will require considered and prudent management, both politically and administratively. The review committee held its inaugural meeting on 13 February. Since then it has had seven further meetings. In addition, a number of sub-groups are actively engaged in advancing the work of the review committee in relation to specific areas of consideration.</P>
      <P>Through a series of oral presentations, the review committee has considered the views of the Ireland Aid Advisory Committee, the National Committee for Development Education and the Agency for Personal Service Overseas. It has also had meetings with Irish NGOs and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs as part of its ongoing consultative process. Over 220 written submissions have been received. Submissions have ranged in scope from full overviews of the aid programme to sectoral inputs and letters raising individual concerns. These are being actively considered, as befits the Government's commitment to a meaningful expansion of the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
      <P>The review process will also seek to create greater public ownership of the Ireland Aid programme and greater public identification with its objectives and achievements. It will examine how this might be attained through a meaningful dialogue between Ireland Aid, the Oireachtas, the Irish people, NGOs, aid workers, missionaries, the private sector and other stakeholders &ndash; possibly by drawing on the successes of existing partnership models.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the review committee will make a number of key recommendations for consideration by the Government. These will, under the review's terms of reference, relate, <i>inter alia</i>, to strategic priority policy areas, geographical range, social and economic development, agriculture and rural development. They will also relate to a number of horizontal issues, including human rights, good governance, gender equality, peace-building and conflict prevention, sustainability, HIV-AIDS and meaningful local participation.</P>
      <P>In addition to considering those issues, the review committee will also make recommendations on the management and organisational structures which will be required to ensure that the Ireland Aid programme expands in the most effective and accountable manner. This will include the option and implications of establishing a new body as proposed in the submission to the review committee by the organisation under reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government stands ready to consider all options and their implications following due <Col N="630" /> examination by the Ireland Aid Review Committee. This consideration will take place in the light of the report which the review committee has been mandated by the Government to prepare precisely for that purpose. It would not be appropriate for me to impair the review committee's deliberations nor to pre-empt its outcome by premature comment on particular matters. Suffice it to say, the Government will give full consideration to all of the relevant issues once the Ireland Aid Review Committee has completed its work, as is anticipated, at the end of the summer.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has been to the forefront of efforts to raise international awareness of the scale of the human tragedy which the epidemic of HIV-AIDS is causing in Africa. He has used every opportunity at international level to draw attention to the crisis and to press for greater action to combat it.</P>
      <P>At EU level, the Taoiseach wrote to the President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, on 26 January 2001. In his letter the Taoiseach pressed for a revitalised EU response to the AIDS crisis in developing countries, particularly in Africa. He called for the EU to adopt a more active international role in this area, given the close relationship between the EU and Africa, the fact that the EU and its member states are collectively the most important aid donor to Africa, and the extensive resources devoted to HIV-AIDS in our development aid programmes.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also raised the issue of access to medicines by poor countries. As a first step towards co-ordinating a more effective EU response to the disease, the Taoiseach suggested that the issue should be put on the agenda of key international meetings dealing with development issues, including the EU-Africa summit, and the EU-SADC ministerial meeting.</P>
      <P>Commission President Prodi replied to the Taoiseach's letter saying that he shared the Taoiseach's concern at the grave tragedy Africa is facing as a result of HIV-AIDS. He outlined the steps which the European Commission has taken to support efforts to combat HIV-AIDS, in particular the financial assistance which the Commission is devoting to the fight against the disease. President Prodi said that it would be useful for the European Council to discuss the EU's response to the crisis, and he looked forward to discussions with developing country partners at the EU Africa Summit, where AIDS was one of the major agenda points. Mr. Prodi also took the opportunity to commend the main policies and strategies of the HIV-AIDS strategy of the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, subsequently raised the issues identified by the Taoiseach at the Development Council. In September 2000, the Commission issued a communication on an accelerated programme of action to fight HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria. An action plan to implement this programme has since been issued. Ireland has participated actively in discussions with the Commission and the other member states on the fight against HIV-AIDS.</P>

      <Quest>the steps the Government intends to take either unilaterally or through the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance for the people of Afghanistan where the lives of up to four million people are threatened by conflict, drought and food shortage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 20 years of conflict has ruined the economy and reduced the living conditions of most of Afghanistan's 20 million population to a bare subsistence level. The United Nations system recently estimated that over half a million Afghans have left their homes since last year due to drought, conflict, or a combination of both, while nearly three million Afghans are now dependent on food aid for survival.</P>
      <P>The Government is actively responding to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Last year, it made that country a priority for humanitarian support as a forgotten emergency and assistance of £440,000 was provided. In March, the Government announced a further package of emergency aid totalling £953,000. This is addressing the effects of drought, crop failure, conflict and displacement, which have devastated the lives of millions of Afghans. It includes allocations to the Irish non-governmental organisations Concern and Christian Aid for projects providing emergency assistance to the most vulnerable among those affected by drought. Some £750,000 was granted to the UN agencies, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and UNICEF through the UN Consolidated Appeal for Afghanistan. This is being directed at the areas of greatest need such as food assistance, food security and emergency health activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further assistance for Afghanistan is anticipated, including an imminent allocation to the countrywide mine victim assistance programme of the International Committee of the Red Cross. By the end of this month, therefore, the Government will have allocated a total of £1.6 million in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan over the preceding nine-month period. This significant contribution is part of a determined effort by the Government to be more pro-active in responding to emergencies through Ireland Aid, while at the <Col N="632" /> same time enabling more timely humanitarian interventions in the field.</P>
    <P>The European Union is the principal donor for the provision of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. In the period 1991-2001, approximately 400 million has been committed by the European Commission for programmes focusing on emergency aid to refugees, returnees and internally displaced people. The Government, along with our European Union colleagues, continues to raise the need to improve the conditions of the general population of Afghanistan. We have stressed the importance of finding a long-term, comprehensive solution which addresses the political difficulties, the issues of terrorism and drugs, as well as the humanitarian situation, including at the UN Security Council. We will continue our efforts to help resolve these issues while at the same time providing bilateral humanitarian assistance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together, as both relate to the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS.</P>
      <P>The HIV-AIDS epidemic is beyond doubt one of the greatest challenges to global development and poverty reduction. At the end of last year, over 36 million people were believed to have been infected with HIV-AIDS. It is estimated that over 22 million people have died of the disease to date. The majority of those infected with HIV virus &ndash; 95% of the global total &ndash; live in the developing world in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the developing countries of Asia. In these situations the epidemic is leading to a reversal of life expectancy and a huge increase in demand for medical and welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear the brunt of HIV and AIDS &ndash; we know that almost 25 million Africans are living with this disease. In Africa, this disease is responsible for the deaths of seven out of ten young adults. It is expected that the number of people who become infected in this age group will continue to increase. This has hugely important economic and social implications for these countries as it is this population sub-group who contribute to the economic development of society. It is this group also who are responsible for the upbringing and welfare of <Col N="633" /> young families. In these situations HIV serves to further contribute to high levels of poverty.</P>
    <P>HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in all countries in Africa where the Government is providing financial support for development programmes, that is, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>In January 2000, in response to this enormous problem, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, launched a HIV-AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid Programme, the purpose of which was to ensure that Ireland Aid is fully responsive to the additional burden HIV-AIDS presents to development in countries benefiting from Government support. The allocation of additional resources for official development assistance has meant that the Government has increasingly contributed to AIDS control programmes in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption of a resolution in September 2000 by the UN General Assembly, a special session of the General Assembly &ndash; UNGASS &ndash; on HIV-AIDS will be held from 25 to 27 June 2001. The objective of this special session is to provide an opportunity to review the global HIV-AIDS epidemic and to intensify international efforts to prevent and contain this disease. The meeting will issue a declaration of commitment to intensify efforts to control the global HIV-AIDS pandemic.</P>
    <P>To signify our commitment to the international fight against HIV-AIDS, the Government will be strongly represented at this special session of the General Assembly. The Irish delegation will be led by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and will include nominees from civil society organisations and other representative groups. The Taoiseach will deliver our national statement to the General Assembly and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will participate in one of the parallel round table discussions, which will examine HIV-AIDS related issues in detail.</P>
    <P>My Department has been co-ordinating the preparations for this special session. It has also been actively involved in the negotiations of the declaration which will be adopted at this meeting. Preparations for the UNGASS have involved discussions with Departments, civil society organisations, Ireland Aid field staff and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland. The output of these discussions will inform the issues which will be raised by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, in the course of their formal presentations at the special session.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, are both attending this meeting, and that our delegation is strongly inclusive of representative groups, signals the extent of the commitment of the Government to addressing the global problem of HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>In the course of the special session, the Government will point to the effects of the epi<Col N="634" /> demic at community level and the links between the spread of HIV-AIDS and global poverty and under-development. The need for the international community to mount an intensive and urgent response will be emphasised. A strong focus will be placed on the importance of leadership &ndash; at international, national and local levels &ndash; in the fight against AIDS. Some issues relating to the prevention and treatment of HIV-AIDS will be highlighted.</P>
    <P>A key theme at the UNGASS will be the need for additional resources to help the most affected countries. It is our belief that the amount of resources committed to date by the international community for the prevention and control of HIV-AIDS has been grossly inadequate. Our input to this meeting will include a call for this situation to be redressed and point to the responsibilities of the public and private sectors to allocate additional resources to the control of this epidemic.</P>

      <P>The Government remains firmly committed to Ireland's policy of military neutrality. It is a policy which has been espoused by successive Irish Governments and has as a core defining characteristic non-membership of military alliances. This policy of military neutrality has gone hand in hand with a strong commitment to international co-operation for peace and stability, as evidenced by Ireland's participation in UN mandated peacekeeping operations. The Defence Acts provide that Ireland would only take part in missions which are specifically authorised by the UN and on the basis of a sovereign case by case decision by the Government, subject to the approval of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also highlight the fact that the Constitution, in Article 29, already affirms Ireland's <Col N="635" /> devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality. Article 29 also affirms our adherence to the principle of pacific settlement of international disputes. Against this background, I do not see a case for amending the Constitution in this area.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the open public debate which will take place on European issues, through the National Forum on Europe, will help to dispel the fears and anxieties that have been expressed during the recent referendum campaign, including the question of Ireland's neutrality. Ireland's involvement in the European Security and Defence Policy is fully consistent with our policy in this area. The Government has made clear that the consent of the people, in a referendum, would be required if the issue of entering a military alliance involving a collective or mutual defence obligation were ever to arise in the future.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a signatory to the treaties establishing the European Communities, including the treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, EURATOM. Article 2(b) of the EURATOM Treaty states that the Community shall facilitate investment and ensure, particularly by <Col N="636" /> encouraging ventures on the part of undertakings, the establishment of the basic installations necessary for the development of nuclear energy in the Community.</P>
      <P>Council Decision 77/270/EURATOM empowers the Commission to approve loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power plants in the Community. Council Decision 94/179/EURATOM permitted the Commission to offer similar loans for power plants in ten states of central and eastern Europe, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Armenia and Ukraine. This activity now comprises the bulk of EURATOM's new lending.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a full member of the European Atomic Energy Community and we participate in the main EURATOM committees. The Government's policy is to ensure that EURATOM's activities in regard to the nuclear industry are directed towards nuclear safety and radiological protection, rather than towards the expansion of the nuclear energy sector. Ireland is obliged to meet its commitments under the EU treaties, including the EURATOM treaty which specifically provides for investment in nuclear facilities. Through our participation, however, we aim to emphasise the nuclear safety imperative, and to seek a shift away from efforts towards support or expansion of the nuclear energy sector.</P>
      <P>The European Investment Bank &ndash; EIB &ndash; does not make loans to the nuclear sector. EIB involvement in this area is restricted to the administration of EURATOM loans which it does under mandate from the Commission and the provision to the Commission of opinions on the economic and financial aspects of individual proposals. These opinions are strictly limited to the economic and financial area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The North-South Ministerial Council &ndash; NSMC &ndash; began operating in December 1999. The council brings together those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government to develop consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed between the two Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland that the council would focus initially on 12 subject areas in respect of which co-operation and implementation for mutual benefit would take place, with further development of these arrangements to be possible on an agreed basis. Co-operation in these 12 areas is being implemented in two ways. <Col N="637" /> In the case of six of them, it is done by means of existing bodies in each jurisdiction separately, also commonly referred to as the areas for co-operation, and in the case of six others by means of new North-South Implementation Bodies, also commonly referred to as the North-South bodies, operating at a cross-Border or all-island level.</P>
    <P>The following are the 12 areas: the six areas for co-operation are: aspects of agriculture, education, environment, health, transport and tourism, in respect of which a publicly-owned limited company, Tourism Ireland Limited has been established to promote the entire island of Ireland overseas as a tourist destination. The six North-South bodies are: Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, the Trade and Business Development Body, now titled Intertrade Ireland, the Special EU Programmes Body, the Language Body, comprising two agencies &ndash; Foras na Gaeilge and The Ulster Scots Agency, and the Foyle Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, also comprising two agencies &ndash; the Loughs Agency and the Lights Agency.</P>
    <P>The NSMC has responsibility for overseeing co-operation in all 12 areas. In addition to meeting twice a year in plenary format, the council meets regularly in sectoral format to take forward co-operation in the 12 areas. Since its establishment in December 1999, there have been 31 meetings of the council &ndash; two in plenary format and 29 in sectoral format.</P>
    <P>Overall the Government is pleased with the level of progress that has been made by the council in the 18 months since its establishment. The implementation bodies are up and running, four of them involving boards of directors. In most cases, the permanent chief executives have been appointed, and in the remaining cases the work of the bodies is being taken forward by interim chief executives, pending the making of permanent appointments. Staff are being recruited and headquarters established. Active programmes of work are being undertaken by the bodies, across a broad range of areas. When fully operational, these bodies are expected to employ a total staff of roughly 900 people and they have a total budget in 2001 of £64 million. I believe that, as they are already demonstrating, these bodies have very great potential in terms of the benefits they can bring to all of the people of this island, North and South.</P>
    <P>In the six areas of co-operation, significant progress has also been made. For instance, Tourism Ireland has been established and the start-up arrangements are well advanced, under the supervision of the board of directors, reporting to my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and his Northern counterpart, Sir Reg Empey, in the NSMC. In other important sectors involved, solid progress is also being made to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island. For instance, the council and its networks of contact and co-operation provided an important platform for the co-ordination of the campaigns of both Administrations to combat <Col N="638" /> the threat of foot and mouth disease on this island.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies that difficulties remain to be overcome. Regrettably, Sinn Féin Ministers have, since November last, been prevented from participating in the council. In their statement of 8 March in Hillsborough, the two Governments recognised that it was essential that the full implementation of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council resume. The pursuit of this objective will form an important part of the Government's approach to the forthcoming talks aimed at achieving the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of difficulties in taking forward co-operation in the transport sector, arising from the refusal of the DUP Minister with responsibility for the matter within the Executive to participate in the North-South Ministerial Council. With the co-operation of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, one meeting of the council has taken place in this sector. Recognising that participation in the council is one of the essential responsibilities attaching to ministerial office in both Administrations, the Government is very anxious that this blockage in the transport sector should be effectively addressed.</P>
    <P>Work is still ongoing between the two Governments and the Northern Ireland authorities on the transfer of the functions of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to the Foyle Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission &ndash; FCILC. A number of technical issues remain to be resolved before this transfer can take place.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these difficulties, solid progress has been achieved by the North-South Ministerial Council. The 31 meetings of the council to date have all been positive and constructive occasions. My colleagues in the Government are working closely and harmoniously with their pro-Agreement Northern counterparts, all of whom, regardless of political affiliation, have participated constructively in the many meetings of the NSMC which they have attended.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that <Col N="639" /> the applications concerned were received in my Department on 7 June 2001. It is the policy of this Department to process all applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. Assuming that an application has been completed correctly and is otherwise in order, it should take approximately seven weeks to process from date of receipt.</P>
      <P>The processing time has increased due to the unprecedented number of applications being received in my Department. The number has increased from an average of 600 per week at the end of 2000 to an average of 1,000 a week currently. Increases in staff resources and overtime working have facilitated the issue of over 14,000 work permits in the first five months of 2001 compared to 4,175 which were issued in the same period last year. Last week a total of 1,343 applications were received.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to examine options for significantly reducing the processing time for the issue of permits. However, in light of the continuing increase in demand for non-EEA labour, employers will have to engage in an appropriate level of forward planning. In this context it should not be forgotten that we are part of the wider European Union labour market and that employers can recruit from that market without any need for work permits.</P>

      <P>Chapter 3 of the national development plan recognises that the rapid pace of economic growth, the pattern of development and increasing urbanisation and centralisation of economic activity have raised issues in relation, <i>inter alia</i>, to infrastructural provision in facilitating and promoting development at regional and national level. In acknowledging these difficulties, the Government set out in the NDP how it proposes to achieve more balanced regional development in order to reduce the disparities between and within the regions and to develop the potential of both to contribute to the greatest possible extent to the continuing prosperity of the country.</P>
      <P>A prerequisite for implementation of Government policy is the achievement of the macro-economic objectives on which the plan is based so that the necessary resources for investment can be made available. It will also require an integrated and flexible approach to the development and implementation of sectoral policies and co-ordinated investment in areas such as transport, education and housing.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for a total investment of some £24 billion in infrastructure through the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme. On a <i>per capita</i> basis, the investment involved will amount to £7,658 in the BMW region and £6,566 in the southern and eastern region. This planned investment in infrastructure is the largest ever undertaken by the State and represents an average annual increase of 55% over 1999 levels, demonstrating the Government's proactive approach and commitment to upgrading the country's infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national spatial strategy currently being prepared by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to be finalised by end 2001, will address the promotion of more balanced regional development on a broader basis, <Col N="641" /> with due regard to improving quality of life, maintaining and enhancing our natural and cultural heritage and sustaining economic development. The spatial strategy will provide a framework within which future decisions on public investment, including investment in infrastructure, can be made in the context of the measures needed to achieve more balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>The agencies under the remit of my Department are actively engaged in facilitating the development of the national spatial strategy, and are inputting into the policy papers being prepared in that respect in terms of infrastructure expenditure and regionalisation of industry. Indeed, both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have recently announced enhanced regional strategies which will lead to an increased focus on the needs of the regions.</P>

      <P>Community employment or CE is a work experience programme whose primary role is to assist the progression of participants into jobs and-or further education and training. FÁS has operational responsibility for the delivery of the programme <Col N="642" /> which has currently approximately 33,500 participants. Following the Government decision in July 1999 to restructure the programme the numbers employed on CE are being gradually reduced.</P>
      <P>In managing the allocation of CE places in the Kerry area, FÁS takes into account the increased demand for workers in the tourism business during the summer months. During the period January to June 2001 participant numbers in the Tralee area increased from 1,119 to 1,176 and in Killarney participant numbers increased from 175 to 191, which is an overall increase of 73 participants in the Kerry area. In this context, recruitment for the programme is not currently taking place. However, FÁS has advised that it will resume in the autumn in line with the budget allocation for the county.</P>

      <P>EUREKA is a Europe-wide network promoting market-driven research and development in fields of advanced technology. Its aim is to strengthen the productivity and worldwide competitiveness of European companies by promoting cross-Border co-operation in R&amp;D of products, processes and services aiming at the world market. Each member state contributes annually to EUREKA's secretariat costs. This contribution is linked to the state's GDP and in Ireland's case this amounted to 23,629 this year. The network does not contribute financially to the research costs of participants, who can, if necessary, seek financial support towards their costs from their respective Governments.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, companies wishing to obtain financial support to finance their involvement in a EUREKA project can apply for assistance under the research, technology and innovation initiative operated by the industrial development agencies as part of the national development plan. To encourage more companies to enjoy the benefits of collaborating in EUREKA projects, research proposals involving collaboration recently became eligible for increased grant levels. In the past five years 11 Irish participants in EUREKA projects have been funded under the aforementioned R&amp;D scheme. The only Irish beneficiaries of funding for EUREKA actions are Irish-based manufacturing and internationally-traded service companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the specific context of giving political impetus to EUREKA, I represent Ireland at the annual EUREKA ministerial meeting where pol<Col N="643" /> icy issues are debated and agreed. As Minister of State with responsibility for science, technology and commerce, I also play a role in promoting EUREKA and other international research and development programmes, both in Ireland and abroad. I am supported in this by the promotional efforts of Enterprise Ireland in that body's continuing efforts to encourage industry to collaborate in research and development. These promotional efforts include regional seminars, regular circulation of relevant brochures, and in particular the holding of business planning meetings with individual companies.</P>

The chairman of the society has been contacted by my Department and he confirms that the club received no funding from the society during 2000. He states that the sums recorded in the society's accounts represent the cost of fisheries development works undertaken by the club in 2000. The accounts have been submitted by the society to my Department in support of the society's claim for Exchequer funding.

      <P>Three aquaculture licences for the bottom culture of mussels in Lough Swilly were granted in November 1999 under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, following public advertisement of the licence applications in the <i>Derry People</i> and <i>Donegal News</i> on 31 October 1997 and 25 June 1999. No objections were received in response to the advertisements or from the statutory consultees including the Northern Regional Fisheries Board which was consulted directly. The decision to licence in each case was also publicly advertised in the <i>Derry People</i> and <i>Donegal News</i> on 24 September 1999 and no appeal against that decision was made to the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board established under that Act.</P>
      <P>Recent correspondence from the Northern Regional Fisheries Board to my Department contained allegations that mussel seed has been deposited on wild oyster beds in Lough Swilly. My Department has sought information on licences granted by the board for the dredging of wild oysters and the volume of shellfish harvested. The Department awaits information from the board. Based on the information received, the Department will assess whether and to what extent, wild oysters in Lough Swilly represent a commercially viable resource.</P>
      <P>If there is clear evidence that wild oysters are present in commercial volumes, the next step would be to undertake a survey to locate and quantify the resource. My Department has indicated that it would give consideration to such a proposal and has asked the Northern Regional Fisheries Board for its views in this regard. At this stage, however, I would be reluctant to impose a wholesale ban on the seeding of licensed aquaculture sites which, given the lack of information on the possible location and extent of wild oyster beds in Louth, might be entirely unwarranted and could result in licence holders suffering considerable financial losses.</P>

      <P>Following the approval of this House, Ireland has <Col N="646" /> participated in Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council since December 1999. Our participation has been on the basis of our Presentation Document, the terms of which were also approved by Dáil Éireann. Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace is fully consistent with our approach to European security. PfP provides an important framework for discussions on the UN-mandated, NATO-led peacekeeping forces in the Balkans to which Ireland is contributing.

The text of the IPP has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General advised that there is no legal requirement for a referendum on Partnership for Peace. Also, participation in Partnership for Peace has no implications for our policy of military neutrality. I do not believe, therefore, that a referendum on this matter is either required or appropriate.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the Government has made clear that the consent of the people, in a referendum, would be required if the issue of entering a military alliance involving a collective or mutual defence obligation were ever to arise in the future.

      <P>The most significant political development in Kosovo has been the announcement by the Head of the UN Interim Administration in Kosovo, UNMIK, Hans Haekkerup, that province-wide elections will be held on 17 November. This accompanied the finalisation of the constitutional framework for provisional self-government in Kosovo on 15 May. The framework sets out the structure and functions of new institutions for provisional self-government in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.

    <P>UNMIK has been conducting meetings with the authorities in Belgrade to give assurances regarding the nature of the new institutions and to secure support of the Kosovo-Serb community.

The framework incorporates the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Protocols. Chapter 4 of the framework sets out the rights to which members of the different communities of Kosovo are entitled. These include linguistic, religious, educational, associational and employment rights. The right of refugee return and property recovery are also enshrined in the framework.</P>
    <P>As a further safeguard for fundamental rights, ten seats in the assembly will be reserved for representatives of the Serb community and ten for the representatives of the Roma, Ashkaeli and Egyptian communities. The special representative of the UN Secretary General will retain the authority to intervene as necessary to protect the rights of communities and their members.</P>
    <P>The influx of refugees displaced by the conflicts in southern Serbia and in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, has been an urgent concern for the authorities in Kosovo. Approximately 8,000 people fled to Kosovo from southern Serbia, although with the re-entry of Yugoslav forces to the demilitarised zone and the demobilisation of ethnic Albanian armed groups, the process of return has already begun. On the other hand, the number of refugees from the conflict in FYROM are estimated at over 30,000 and will probably increase.</P>
    <P>Economically, Kosovo has been recovering from a very low base. Unemployment remains very high. UNMIK has been working to establish the functioning tax system necessary for a self-sustaining budget for the province. Tax collection points at Kosovo's boundaries prompted roadblocks and demonstrations by the Kosovo Serb community which interpreted them as customs points. An IMF report in February 2001 assessed agricultural production to have reached three-quarters of pre-conflict levels, with a high level of construction activity but with the industrial sector remaining depressed.</P>
    <P>Ethnically and politically motivated violence continues to be a serious threat to stability and reconciliation in Kosovo. In the past three months, UNMIK has reported a general increase in tensions in Mitrovica, Gnjilane and Pristina regions. UNMIK has enacted new anti-terrorism measures to prevent armed violence within Kosovo and the support of violence across its boundaries.</P>
    <P>While fully supporting process of transferring ownership of the political and economic institutions of Kosovo to its people in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244, Ireland believes the continued engagement of the inter<Col N="648" /> national community in Kosovo to be of vital importance. Ireland will continue to work actively, particularly through the structures of the UN and the European Union, to promote peaceful development in the province.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 121, 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Afghanistan remains extremely grim with no sign of any political solution to end the civil war there in the near future. With approximately 90% of the territory under the control of the Taliban and the remainder under the control of the opposition  &ndash; the United Front-Northern Alliance &ndash; there are increasing fears that the summer period will be used by both sides, which have reinforced their positions, for a further round of fighting. The Taliban continue to refuse any peace negotiations with direct or even indirect UN involvement. The various involvements of a number of regional states constitute a further obstacle to peace.</P>
      <P>Within the territory controlled by the Taliban the imposition of an extreme form of Sharia law and increasing harassment of aid organisations, make the delivery of humanitarian aid more difficult. The plight of the civilian population, already made difficult by the ongoing conflict, has become even more serious through the effects of drought and there are fears that the already high number of internally displaced persons could increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation, therefore, is one of the most profound concern to the international community and this is the background against which Ireland, both at the UN Security Council and through the EU, is seeking to work towards an alleviation of these problems. The priorities remain the search for a way to bring about peace negotiations, the continuation of the effort to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need and the implementation of UN sanctions to control the illegal flow of arms <Col N="649" /> and other materials. Ireland endeavours at all relevant fora to ensure that the question of human rights is also properly addressed. At Ireland's initiative the specific aspect of the treatment of women was included in the common position adopted by the EU in January 2001, and Ireland has also raised this aspect in our interventions at the UN Security Council.</P>

      <P>There has been a serious deterioration in the situation in the mainly Berber region of Kabylie in north eastern Algeria. Violence followed protests at the reported death in police custody of a Berber youth, Guermah Massinissa, on 18 April and alleged assaults by the Algerian police on members of a Berber student organisation. These events sparked off public demonstrations across the region, with clashes taking place between the Algerian security forces and Berber youths in a number of population centres.</P>
      <P>According to the Algerian authorities, 30 demonstrators were killed in clashes between the security forces and rioting youths. Other reports have put the number of deaths as high as 80. There have been demonstrations in other parts of Algeria, including the capital, Algiers, in support of the Berber protests. On the political front, one of the main Berber political parties, the Rassemblement pour la Culture et la Democratie &ndash; RCD &ndash; pulled out of the government on 1 May in protest at its handling of the situation. The President of Algeria has announced the creation of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the causes of the violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is deeply saddened at the outbreak of violence and loss of life in Kabylie. It remains very seriously concerned at the deteriorating situation in Algeria. The Government believes that all sides should avoid actions which could result in further violence. In particular, it calls on the Algerian authorities to exercise <Col N="650" /> restraint and to take additional measures to defuse the current crisis and bring about a peaceful restoration of calm in the region. In the longer term, it calls on the Algerian authorities to take concrete measures to address the underlying social, economic and political issues which lie at the heart of the recent unrest.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to take every appropriate opportunity in its bilateral contacts and through the process of dialogue between Algeria and the EU, especially in the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, to help improve the situation in Algeria. We have urged the Algerian authorities to take the necessary steps that will hopefully lead to an ending of the conflict and for the establishment of independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and for bringing those responsible to justice.</P>
    <P>The situation in Algeria was discussed by the EU at the meeting of the European Council in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June. The Council urged all those responsible in Algeria to act to end the current confrontations and violence. It called on the authorities to launch a political initiative to overcome the crisis by means of dialogue among all Algerians and stated that the EU stands ready to assist the political, economic and social reforms necessary for restoring peace, stability and prosperity.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 9 May this year. Since then, the European Union has adopted a common position on Nigeria and Ireland fully subscribes to it. In the common position, Ireland and its European partners indicated that we intend to maintain a positive, constructive and consistent approach towards Nigeria, to support it in its efforts to consolidate democracy and to advance economic development.</P>
      <P>The common position identifies five key areas for future EU support, namely, the development of a democratic culture, institutional capacity building, the poverty reduction strategy paper, economic growth and development and strengthening Nigerian capacity for regional integration, conflict prevention and resolution and crisis management in west Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the European Union has adopted a common position on Nigeria is an indication of the high priority we attach to it and its development. It is in the best interests not only of Nigeria, but of the sub-region and of the continent as a whole that Nigeria continues to develop in a stable and democratic way. We will continue, therefore, to <Col N="651" /> monitor events in Nigeria and to support its efforts to create a just and democratic society of which all Nigerians can feel proud to be part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy on 9 May, significant progress has been achieved in Mozambique in the past decade. The end of the brutal civil war and the establishment of a multi-party democracy have provided a strong basis for future political development. At the same time, the country's economy has experienced significant expansion.</P>
      <P>I remain conscious that this political and economic progress remains fragile. Mozambique's economic performance is heavily dependent on massive inflows of international assistance and considerable political tension remains between Frelimo, the ruling party of President Chissano, and the opposition, Renamo, led by Alfonso Dhlakama. The current political difficulties can be traced to the presidential and parliamentary elections of December 1999, which were disputed and challenged by Renamo. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the results were valid, a verdict also reached by international election observers.</P>
      <P>These difficulties exacerbated long-standing political tensions and gave rise to several outbreaks of violence. The most serious incident occurred last November when at least 28 people were killed in clashes between police and Renamo supporters in northern and central parts of the country. Renamo continues to demand more political concessions from President Chissano in exchange for their agreement to accept their opposition status. In recent months, a series of negotiations aimed at ending the political tension has taken place between the president and Mr. Dhlakama. While some progress has been made at these talks, they have so far failed to resolve all outstanding matters.</P>
      <P>Along with our EU colleagues, Ireland condemned the violence that took place last November and the excesses which accompanied the demonstrations. I firmly believe that the dialogue between the two main parties remains the only viable way of overcoming the current political difficulties. It is essential that the considerable progress achieved since the end of the civil war is not jeopardised. With our EU colleagues, we will continue to monitor developments closely and to make known our views where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mozambique is a priority country for Ireland Aid. A total of £15.5 million has been allocated for the programme budget for 2001. The Govern<Col N="652" /> ment has provided more than £1 million in emergency assistance to meet the humanitarian needs caused by extensive flooding in 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy on 9 May, the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea on 12 December 2000 was a significant development that brought an end to their brutal border war. The Government warmly welcomed this achievement and believes that the agreement provides the real prospect of lasting peace for their war weary peoples.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the terms of the agreement are fully implemented without delay. I, therefore, welcome the progress that has been made to date. The formal establishment of the temporary security zone &ndash; TSZ &ndash; on 18 April was an important development. Some elements of the agreement remain outstanding and I urge both parties to resolve these as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Ireland has actively contributed to Security Council deliberations on the situation since becoming a member of the council in January. Along with our EU partners, we will continue to support the peace process and promote initiatives aimed at creating long-term reconciliation between the two countries. The Government is also actively exploring the possibility of contributing Irish troops to the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea &ndash; UNMEE &ndash; later in the year.</P>
      <P>There have been signs of rising political tension in Ethiopia in recent months. In April, 38 people were killed and over 200 were injured when protests by students at the University of Addis Ababa escalated into violence. The government accused opposition forces of being behind the disturbances and a number of leading opposition figures were subsequently arrested. Internal difficulties within the main governing coalition party &ndash; the TPLF &ndash; have exacerbated existing political tensions. In late April, an EU troika delegation met the Ethiopian Government to express our deep concern at the violence and at reports of excessive use of force by the security forces, mass arrests and other human rights abuses. The delegation called for an investigation into the events. We will continue to monitor developments in Ethiopia closely and to express our concerns where appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 9 May this year. Since that reply, the United Nations Security Council has extended the mandate of the United Nations mission &ndash; MONUC &ndash; for 12 months following the almost complete disengagement of opposing troops from front lines in eastern DRC in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1341.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes these positive developments, but has expressed its concern at reported instances of non-co-operation by several of the rebel groups. We have repeatedly stressed that the onus is now on the signatories to the Lusaka agreement to honour their commitments under the agreement and to resist the temptation to use the ceasefire which is now in force and the redeployment of forces to seek advantage over their fellow signatories.</P>
      <P>The report of the United Nations panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo &ndash; DRC &ndash; released in April, makes a number of extremely serious allegations against countries involved in the DRC war. The Government has expressed its concern at the grave nature of these allegations and has made clear its expectation that the relevant national authorities must thoroughly investigate the allegations and co-operate fully with the panel of experts in its future work. We, therefore, welcome Uganda's decision to establish an independent judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the allegations against it.</P>
      <P>The panel of experts is due to report back to the Security Council in August with an addendum to its report which will be carefully studied by the Government. If no progress is reflected in this addendum, the Security Council will consider the measures necessary to put an end to the illegal exploitation of the resources of the DRC. No effort must be spared by the relevant authorities to ensure that activities which undermine the peace process in the DRC are halted and that the Congolese people can finally be allowed to benefit directly from the natural wealth of their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The humanitarian situation in the DRC remains extremely serious and we have supported the call in the most recent report of the United <Col N="654" /> Nations Secretary General for the establishment of humanitarian corridors to allow the resumption of food and other trade between Kinshasa and the eastern and northern provinces. As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland contributes actively to efforts to end the DRC crisis. Ireland participated in a successful Security Council mission to the Great Lakes region in mid-May which assessed the situation on the ground. We were particularly encouraged by the growing consensus that long-term stability in the region depends on the dismantling, through disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and repatriation, of the so-called negative forces operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</P>
    <P>It is important that all those parties subscribe to the wish of the international community for the reintegration of the national territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the assumption by the Congolese people, at long last, of control over their own political and economic destiny.</P>

      <P>The situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &ndash; FYROM &ndash; is extremely serious. There is a real risk of escalation and of regional destabilisation that had to be addressed by the international community. Ireland, through our membership of the EU and of the UN Security Council, has consistently condemned acts of extremist violence and supported a proportionate response by the government of FYROM, while calling for the maximum possible restraint. With our partners in the EU, we have also repeatedly stressed the need for inclusive political dialogue to ensure long-term stability and to respond to the legitimate needs of the ethnic Albanian community in FYROM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland participated in the drafting of UN Security Council Resolution 1345 on the situation in FYROM on 21 March. This called, <i>inter alia</i>, on leaders of ethnic Albanian communities in Kosovo, FYROM and southern Serbia publicly to condemn violence and to use their influence to secure peace and on KFOR to strengthen border security measures further. The European Union has also played a leading role in international efforts to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the crisis. A stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and FYROM was signed on 9 April. Ireland has encouraged High Representative Solana in his extensive talks with political <Col N="655" /> leaders in FYROM as he worked to avoid the declaration of a state of war and secure a joint commitment to substantive political negotiations.</P>
    <P>The European Council at Gothenburg reaffirmed the necessity of a political solution. It announced that an agreement in the political dialogue, which it is willing to facilitate further, will create the conditions for the EU to provide further assistance to FYROM. In this context, the Council agreed to appoint, for a limited period of time, a representative of the EU, resident in Skopje, who will act under the authority of the High Representative.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation as outlined by the Deputy. An official of my Department has recently had a meeting with the Irish Postal Union to discuss the difficulties presented by the failure of the company to operate the scheme at all outlets. Further discussions on the matter are scheduled for the near future and the Deputy may be assured that my Department will continue to follow up on these matters with the company.</P>

      <P>Currently many people access the Internet via the public telephone network. This is known as dial up access. The director of telecommunications regulation has put in place measures to enable operators to develop service offerings for dial up access on a competitive basis. It is a matter for operators to take up this facility and devise pricing for charges for dial up Internet access to offer the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including access to Internet services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of telecommunications policy. I have in recent years put <Col N="657" /> in place a number of initiatives which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas. Such connectivity facilitates e-commerce activities.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, 26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled out broadband nation-wide were supported and are now nearing completion. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to 200 million. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received I signed nine contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of 160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately 55 million.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service vessel, <i>LE Deirdre</i>, was decommissioned earlier this year. The ship, built in 1971, had completed almost 30 years of operational duties and had reached the end of its economic life.</P>
      <P>
        <i>LE Deirdre</i> is being replaced by the second new ship built for the Naval Service by Appledore Shipbuilders limited. The building of the ship, to be named <i>LE Niamh</i>, is almost complete and the vessel should be ready for sea trials in the second week of July 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> In consultation with the Naval Service, it was agreed that the services of a professional shipbroker-agent would be engaged to assist the Department of Defence with the sale of the vessel and expressions of interest were sought in the daily newspapers in April 2001. Mr. Dominic Daly from Cork was subsequently engaged to assist the Department in this regard.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were made by Mr. Daly to proceed with the sale of <i>LE Deirdre</i> by public auction on Thursday, 14 June in the Carrigaline Court Hotel, Carrigaline, County Cork. Bidding for the vessel started at the ship's scrap value of £50,000 and increased to a final bid of £190,000 from Seastream International limited, Cornwall, England. The conditions of sale for the auction stated that the sale of <i>LE Deirdre</i> shall be subject to the approval of the Minister for Defence and I intend dealing with the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In line with the White Paper on Defence, the standard Permanent Defence Force Steyr 5.56mm rifle will become the primary individual weapon for appropriate personnel in the Reserve Defence Force. The replacement programme has begun. Some 1,500 Steyr rifles were issued to the reserve last year. A further 2,000 Steyr rifles have now been acquired to advance this programme. I am delighted with the progress made to date on this important issue.</P>
      <P>I will make a decision on the acquisition of additional armoured personnel carriers for the Defence Forces later this year. A board of officers was set up by the military authorities last year to develop the concept of a light tactical vehicle. The board is currently working to develop the required characteristics of the proposed vehicle and it is too early to say when the tender documentation will be ready for issue.</P>
      <P>The building of the second new ship for the Naval Service by Appledore Shipbuilders limited in England is almost complete. The ship, to be named <i>LE Niamh</i>, is a replacement for <i>LE Deirdre </i>which has reached the end of its economic life and has been decommissioned. During builders sea trials, which take place in advance of customer acceptance sea trials, a problem arose with the port gearbox on the ship. The contractual issues in regard to both gearboxes are being addressed by Appledore Shipbuilders limited with the manufacturer of the gearboxes, Scana Volda of Norway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When both gearboxes are reinstated and re-commissioned, the ship will undergo customer acceptance sea trials which will be attended by representatives of the Department of Defence <Col N="659" /> and the Naval Service. These sea trials are scheduled for the second week of July 2001. Once completed, and everything going well, the ship will be officially handed over to the Department. The ship, which was originally scheduled for delivery in September 2001, will then sail to Haulbowline and will enter operational service as soon as possible thereafter. Following its arrival in Ireland, the new ship will be fitted with a second hand Oto Melara 76mm gun manufactured in Italy.</P>

He has also received compensation in settlement of a civil action against this Department for the same disablement. In this regard, the Army pensions Acts provide that alternative compensation received may be taken into consideration in fixing the level, if any, of disablement gratuity. The question of whether all or some of the compensation received by him should be taken into account is under consideration. The matter will be decided as quickly as possible at which stage the individual will be informed of the outcome.</P>

She reached the age of 66 on 23 March 2000, however, and before payment of her early retirement pension can start my Department has to establish whether she is entitled to a national retirement pension. If she is, then under the EU regulation governing the early retirement scheme her national pension must be offset against her pension under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named has been asked to provide evidence from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs of her eligibility, or otherwise, to either the contributory or non-contributory old age pension. She was asked for this evidence on 2 February and when it is received my Department will make arrangements without delay for payment of the appropriate rate of early retirement pension. She will receive full back payment to 30 December 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>BSE legislation provides that farmers are compensated at current market value rates for animals that have been depopulated as a result of BSE. The compensation is paid to enable farmers to restock. Re-population of the farm is normally permitted 30 days after satisfactory completion of cleansing disinfection so the farmer need not be out of business for a prolonged period of time. There is no provision for payment of other compensation in respect of BSE depopulations.</P>
      <P>It was necessary, in the national interest of ensuring that everything possible was done to minimise the risk of the spread of FMD, to enforce controls on animal movements generally, including on re-stocking, during the crisis. I have no plans to establish a compensation package for loss of income during this period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The 30 day holding period between purchase of an animal while it is alive and its onward supply or sale was introduced under the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001. It is an exceptional measure applicable only in such circumstances deemed necessary to avoid the outbreak or spread of disease. It applies equally to all persons engaged in the purchase or sale of animals with the exception of persons consigning animals to slaughter or cattle for export through an approved assembly centre. In view of the current FMD situation, I considered it essential to invoke <Col N="667" /> this provision in regard to animal movements over the last number of months. I am mindful of the advice received from the expert advisory group on FMD that this restriction should remain in place for the present. I am keeping the situation under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development: (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sheep shearing is a sensitive issue in the context of foot and mouth disease, given the risk of spreading the disease through close physical contact between shearers and sheep and the movement between flocks by commercial shearers.</P>
      <P>Following a joint submission from the relevant organisations representing farmers, sheep shearers and the Irish Wool Federation, a regulated regime has been introduced with effect from 28 May last. This regime includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the registration of commercial sheep shearers, though there is no restriction on farmers shearing their own sheep. I consider this to be a prudent approach, given the serious ongoing foot and mouth problem in the UK, and I understand that more than 420 sheep shearers have registered under the new regime.</P>
      <P>I have no immediate plans to change these rules, although they will be kept under review in light of the evolving FMD situation in the UK and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Based on the recommendations of the expert group, I announced a series of adjustments to the movement controls for cattle, including the permitting system, which were effective from Monday 18 June. The position is that the permit system for cattle is being retained only for farm to farm movements. It has been discontinued in respect of the movement of cattle to and from marts, for slaughter, within the holding and for export. In addition, the seven day rule restricting movements out of a herd after buying-in, and limitations on pick-ups and multiple destinations have been removed.</P>
      <P>The permit procedures for farm to farm sales of cattle were of course introduced to minimise the risk of spreading the foot and mouth disease virus. The system has worked well and since its inception on 14 May last; over 46,000 permits have been issued in respect of 224,000 cattle.</P>
      <P>In so far as sheep and pigs are concerned, permit arrangements that allow the movement of these species for slaughter and on animal welfare grounds have been in operation since early March. I consider that these arrangements have facilitated the orderly movement of sheep and pigs where necessary while maintaining essential levels of regulation on movement for disease control purposes.</P>

      <P>SWS Limited, Bandon, is operating the cattle movement permitting system on behalf of the Department. More than 35 staff are currently engaged in delivery of this service. I have monitored the situation closely and I am satisfied that applications for permits are being processed promptly and issued without delay. Since this permitting system was introduced on 14 May last, 46,000 permits have been issued in respect of 224,000 animals. Of course, the issue of a number of permits has been refused or suspended as a result of errors or invalid data on application forms.</P>
      <P>In so far as contact by phone is concerned, the call centre at Bandon has dealt consistently with in excess of 2,500 calls on each day of operation of the permitting arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The removal of sheep from the Curragh was part of a range of measures intended to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. The consequences of further outbreaks of the disease have already been well publicised. In short, the spread of the disease to areas of the country other than County Louth would have had catastrophic consequences for farmers, including those on the Curragh, and for the agri-food industry, the tourism sector and many other sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>Sheep are considered to present a particular risk in the spread of foot and mouth disease because of the difficulty in diagnosing the disease and the incubation period in the species. For this reason it remains the case that the expert group, which I established, has not yet recommended that the normal movement of sheep should be allowed to resume. Therefore sheep may, for the present, be moved only under permit directly for slaughter or between segments of the same holding for welfare reasons. In the case of the movement of sheep for welfare reasons, a veterinary examination is required to establish both whether the sheep are infected with FMD and whether there is a welfare issue which would require the sheep to be moved.</P>
      <P>I am, on the basis of advice from the expert group, keeping the remaining FMD controls under review and I will consider relaxing the controls in relation to the movement of sheep when my veterinary advisers consider it appropriate to do so. I have received no such advice to date.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of funding for farmers on the Curragh, the position is that all but one of the farmers whose sheep were grazing on the Curragh removed their animals when requested to do so, in the national interest and indeed, in their own interests. I must commend this group of farmers for their responsible action in this case.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the various control measures introduced to combat foot and mouth disease caused great inconvenience and in some cases hardship, to people and organisations in all sectors of society, including farmers whose sheep were grazing the Curragh. However, these controls were introduced in the face of a threat which would have had far worse consequences for all of those affected.</P>
      <P>I do not, therefore, consider it appropriate to provide compensation to farmers for the impact of measures introduced to protect their livelihoods and the future of the agricultural industry from the ravages of foot and mouth disease. I will of course comply with any decisions of the courts in relation to this issue.</P>

      <P>The rates of payment agreed with the IFA for the area based compensatory allowances scheme are as follows: more severely handicapped lowland gets £70 per hectare for up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped lowland gets £60 per hectare for up to 45 hectares; mountain land gets £45 per hectare for up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million in 2001 representing an increase of about £60 million over 2000. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 in the past to 109,000 in 2001. From 2001, some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 will incur some losses. I have, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be £32 rising to £64 in 2002. Concern has been expressed that farmers in the mountain category should get a higher rate of payment and this matter is being examined at present.</P>

      <P>All parties involved in the national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS &ndash; producers, marts and meat companies will be legally obliged to ensure full traceability under the terms of the system. From the 21 June 2001 producers will have to tag their sheep prior to movement and record details of all sheep movements to and from their holdings. Marts will be obliged to keep records of all sheep movements through their premises. Processors will be required to accept only sheep which are properly tagged and documented in accordance with NSIS, to record the details of all sheep accepted for slaughter and to show the individual sheep tag number on the finished carcass.</P>
      <P>Ireland will thus, for the first time, have full traceability for all sheep, on an individual animal basis. This will be of significant benefit, most notably in terms of disease control, quality and consumer assurance, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheep meat forum, which reported in October 1999.</P>

      <P>This issue was dealt with at length during the Dáil and Seanad debates on the Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Act, 2001. The issue of a bonus or share participation scheme for regular savers with a company following a disposal only arises in the case of organisations such as mutual building societies, which are legally owned by their customers. This does not apply in the case of TSB or any of the State companies such as ACC and ICC Bank, where the shares are held by the State on behalf of all citizens. The proceeds from the sale of the TSB Bank will, in accordance with the law, accrue to the Exchequer, which will in turn benefit all citizens.</P>

To facilitate this process, each participating Department or Office is required to produce a customer action plan, indicating how full effect is given to various guiding principles for the delivery of quality customer service. The Department of Finance customer action plan states that all replies should carry a contact name and telephone number.

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have agreed terms for the acquisition of a site for the erection of a Garda station in Leixlip. The site is beside the Church of Our Lady's Nativity and Gaelscoil Uí Dhalaigh and is owned by the parish authorities.</P>
      <P>The commissioners are satisfied that the site they have agreed to purchase is adequate for the provision of a Garda station and they have no intention of encroaching on the playing fields of the Gaelscoil. The exact boundary of the site, which is at present undefined, will be agreed in consultation with the parish authorities and the Gaelscoil as adjoining owners.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the commissioners have been seeking a site for a Garda station in Leixlip for some time now to no avail. I am satisfied that any alternatives available at this time have been explored fully and this site affords the best option for the provision of a Garda station in Leixlip.</P>

      <P>The transfer lists currently set up in the Civil Service relate mainly to the clerical officer grade. The numbers on the transfer lists for the main Departments with offices in County Kerry are given in the attached table. There will be some duplication in that individual officers may apply for transfer to the offices of a number of Departments in the same location, or to more than one location within the same Department and could, therefore, be included in more than one list. Any transfer arrangements applying in the wider public service rather than the Civil Service would be a matter for the organisations in question.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board is opening a temporary office in Caherciveen, pending the building of a permanent office which is scheduled for completion in spring 2002. About 20 staff will take up duty in July 2001. It is expected that a small number of other staff will take up duty in Caherciveen later this year and the balance of the total complement of around 40 posts will be in place in spring 2002 when the permanent premises are available.</P>

      <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is largely subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero rated before 1 January 1991, we cannot introduce any new zero rate of VAT and cannot therefore relieve such services as referred to by the Deputy. While the directive provides for reduced rating of certain goods and services in certain circumstances, none of these apply to the provision of alarm monitoring services. We cannot therefore apply a reduced rate to the provision of this service, which is subject to the standard rate of VAT at 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>I would add that under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order, 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system, as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund Order. Applicants should contact Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayment (Unregistered Section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the sampling of oil used in motor vehicles is carried out by Customs and Excise officers who have been trained and authorised for this purpose. These officers are empowered to examine any motor vehicle and to draw samples of oil from the vehicle's fuel tank for inspection and testing. The sampling is carried out in order to ensure that only autodiesel on which full excise duty has been paid is used in those vehicles which are not authorised to use marked gas oil &ndash; MGO &ndash; on which a rebate of duty has been allowed. MGO is rebated on condition that it is used solely for non-automotive purposes such as home heating <Col N="679" /> or in agricultural tractors, etc. In order to distinguish MGO from autodiesel, a green dye and chemical markers are added at the time of delivery from warehouse. The rebated rate of excise duty for MGO is £37.30 per 1,000 litres, while the full rate of duty on diesel for automotive purposes is £196.14 per 1,000 litres. Autodiesel yielded £509 million in excise duty for the Exchequer last year.</P>
      <P>It is an offence to keep MGO in the fuel tank of certain motor vehicles or to use it in certain motor vehicles for automotive purposes. A uniformed officer may stop a vehicle for the purpose of examining it and drawing a sample of oil. These powers are provided in section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, and section 86 of the Finance Act, 1995. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that officers are issued with sampling devices that enable them to draw oil from the fuel tanks of motor vehicles. A visual examination, gravity tests and indicative chemical tests may be performed on the spot to establish if the oil contains indications of any of the prescribed markers. This is generally done in the presence of the owner-driver but unattended vehicles are also sampled. If a vehicle's fuel tank is locked, the person in charge of the vehicle is requested to remove the lock to enable the officer to sample the fuel. If the vehicle is unattended and the fuel tank is locked, an officer will normally make every effort to locate the owner. If the owner cannot be located, it may be possible for the officer to satisfy himself-herself as to the contents of the fuel tank without removing the lock. In exceptional circumstances where the officer has reason to suspect that an offence is being committed, he-she may take whatever steps are necessary to sample the oil. In this event, a senior officer is consulted. It is an offence to resist, obstruct or impede an officer in carrying out his-her duties. Officers always exercise due care and attention when sampling motor vehicles.</P>
      <P>If, following visual examination or on the spot tests, there is any reason to suspect that the oil is MGO, samples are drawn and put into containers which are sealed and sent to the State Laboratory for analysis. A duplicate sealed sample is offered to the owner-driver of the vehicle, if in attendance. It is not uncommon for persons to go the great lengths to conceal the illegal use of MGO. Double tanks, concealed tanks and other special contrivances are regularly detected and officers are particularly vigilant with regard to this type of aggravated fraud when they examine motor vehicles. In addition to the ordinary sanction of prosecution, any vehicles which are fitted with special contrivances of this nature containing MGO are liable to forfeiture and are seized. Last year there were 1,513 detections of the illegal use of MGO.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation which will, <i>inter alia</i>, facilitate meeting the objectives for risk equalisation out<Col N="681" /> lined in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance, has recently been passed by Dáil Éireann and is currently before Seanad Éireann for consideration. It is my intention that the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, will be enacted before the summer recess. Risk equalisation regulations to be introduced pursuant to the Bill will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for affirmation as soon as possible after enactment and I hope to be in a position to do so during the autumn.</P>
    <P>As stated in the White Paper, changes are being made to the framework for risk equalisation to further facilitate competition. The Bill provides that the Health Insurance Authority, which I established on 1 February this year, will have a significant role to play in relation the commencement of any transfers under the proposed regulations. The original risk equalisation regulations were revoked and no sum is due to any insurer in the market at this time. My position on risk equalisation is fully set out on the record of this House in connection with my explanation and defence of the need for such measures in the course of all stages of debate on the amending Bill. I am satisfied that the revised regulatory framework currently being completed will facilitate competition while ensuring that community rating across the whole market is not distorted, should there be evidence of material differences in the risk profiles of insurers going forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of that scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report and the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. <Col N="682" /> Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use, to be refunded speedily.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that, as a result of the interpretation of article 8.2, a total of 463 cases have been identified and the payments made so far have amounted to £313,000. Of these cases, 319 are in respect of persons now deceased. I understand that the South-Eastern Health Board has written to the next-of-kin of deceased persons and, in this regard, payment has been made or is in the process of being made in 236 of these cases. Reminders have been issued in the remaining 83 cases where a reply has not been received.</P>
    <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million. In relation to the South-Eastern Health Board, I understand that there are 165 cases in the board's area where payments were reduced and 121 cases where subvention was refused because of this provision. The board has advised me that it estimates the cost of making payments on this issue will be £1.847 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, the making of payments will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The background to the case is as follows. The woman concerned tested positive for hepatitis C in October 1997 while she and her family were resident in the State. Subsequently, she claimed travelling and subsistence expenses from the<i> ex gratia </i>scheme operated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board now the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. The <i>ex gratia</i> scheme was introduced in 1994 to ensure that persons who had contracted hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood and blood products made available by the BTSB did not undergo any undue hardship in availing of medical treatment for their condition. The <i>ex gratia </i>payments are made on an interim basis pending the award of compensation by the hepatitis C compensation tribunal or by the courts and are not contingent on continued residence within the State.</P>
      <P>The BTSB made <i>ex gratia</i> payments totalling £2,061 to the woman concerned between November 1997 and April 1998. <i>Ex gratia </i>payments are usually made on production of receipts. However, following representations from Positive Action in December 1997, arrangements were made to pay the woman in advance. In order to continue making payments the BTSB required medical evidence that anti-D had been administered to her. It wrote to the woman on 5 June, 15 June and 7 July 1998 requesting this confirmation. No such confirmation has been provided to the BTSB to date. The BTSB ceased making <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the woman in April 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious dispute has emerged in this case between the woman and the Western Health Board regarding the source of her hepatitis C infection. The woman believes that the source was infected anti-D administered to her following <Col N="684" /> the birth of her child in Castlebar Hospital in March 1993. She alleges that a medical record was later altered to denote that anti-D was not administered. The board stated that its medical records show that anti-D was not administered to the woman while she was under their care in March 1993.</P>
    <P>The woman's family requested the gardaí to investigate whether anti-D was administered to her in Castlebar Hospital, and whether her hospital records had been materially altered. The gardaí visited the hospital on 28 October and the 16 November 1998 in relation to this investigation and, at the request of the hospital, took a number of records away for forensic examination. Neither I nor the Western Health Board have been informed of the results of that examination. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to seek such information from the Garda authorities. However, the Western Health Board accepts that the woman's record was amended but is fully satisfied that the amended record reflects the accurate position, which is that the woman never received anti-D. The board does not accept that the record had been inappropriately changed and the medical consultant in charge of the woman's care while in Castlebar Hospital is adamant that the woman never received the anti-D product.</P>
    <P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy indicates that the BTSB cannot show that the woman's hepatitis C was not contracted while in Ireland. However, the BTSB has had a sequencing test carried out on a blood sample from the woman concerned. Tests carried out by the independent laboratory jointly run by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Edinburgh, indicated that the source of the woman's hepatitis C infection was not the anti-D product manufactured by the BTSB. The laboratory's findings are disputed by the woman. The correspondence also states that others who have been compensated have not been asked to prove that they were infected in Ireland. This is not the case. The tribunal is obliged to satisfy itself on the balance of probabilities that the source of the hepatitis C infection is the administration of blood or blood products within the State.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, indicated on numerous occasions to the woman concerned and her family that he considered that the hepatitis C compensation tribunal was the most appropriate forum in which to have this matter resolved. The tribunal has a statutory remit to determine causation on the balance of probabilities. On 30 June 1998, an offer was made to the woman to arrange an early hearing on the causation issue alone independent of considerations of compensation. In addition, as the woman is now living abroad, my Department offered as an exceptional measure to arrange financial assistance for herself and her family to facilitate their attendance at the compensation tribunal. It was also explained to the woman that while the tribunal does not nor<Col N="685" /> mally compensate persons in respect of health care requirements, claimants to the tribunal who are ordinarily resident outside the State may apply to the tribunal for health care costs.</P>
    <P>During 2000 the woman's legal representatives informed my Department that their client would be attending the hepatitis C compensation tribunal and the necessary arrangements were made by my Department to cover the expenses which she would incur in attending the tribunal. As the hepatitis C compensation tribunal is independent in its operation of both myself and my Department, I am not in a position to confirm the outcome of the hearing. I understand from media reports, however, that the woman withdrew her case from the compensation tribunal before any determination had been made, reportedly with the intention of pursuing the case directly through the High Court. To date, my Department has not received any notification that High Court proceedings have been initiated. However, I remain of the view that the most expeditious way to resolve the matter is for the woman to apply to return to the compensation tribunal as soon as possible. The tribunal has the confidence of the four support groups representing persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration of infected blood and blood products, and over 1,400 individuals have had their claims determined by the tribunal to date.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000. BreastCheck is strongly committed to reaching all women in the target age group 50 to 64 years as quickly as the campaign allows. Phase one of the <Col N="686" /> programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area, the North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. Special legislation was passed allowing BreastCheck to collate a register of eligible women and screening will be offered to well women, who have no symptoms, in a systematic way so that all eligible women can be screened routinely every two years.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck offers screening to women in the target age group by invitation only and is, therefore, not a demand service. If a woman has symptoms she should consult her general practitioner. Women in the target age group will be automatically invited for screening on an area by area basis, in a fair and equitable manner covering each of the health board areas in phase one. It was determined from the outset that this programme should initially be limited to women in the 50 to 64 age group, but it is anticipated that when the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service can be delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing the screening of women already in the programme who have reached 65 years of age. Screening by mammography under the age of 50 remains unproved in terms of reduction in mortality.</P>

      <P>A national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors is under way on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in con<Col N="691" /> sultation with the social partners. The review is primarily focused on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review is nearing completion and the findings will be submitted to the Government.</P>
      <P>The introduction of universal medical card coverage would require a complete renegotiation of the contract with the Irish Medical Organisation. The outcome of such talks and the resultant cost implications cannot be accurately estimated.</P>

      <P>As I advised the Deputy in reply to a similar parliamentary question on 12 June 2001, in general there are no difficulties in filling vacancies for consultant posts. The most recent figures on the level of vacancies for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in the public hospital service indicate that approximately 1% of posts are currently vacant. Present indications do not suggest that there will be any substantial increase in the vacancy situation on 1 July this year. A national monitoring group has been established to keep the situation pertaining to NCHD vacancies under review. If any significant vacancies arise, the national monitoring group will deliberate and appropriate action will be taken.</P>

      <P>Policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of documents, including the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the report of the review group on the ambulance service and building healthier hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. The approach set out in these documents follows the internationally accepted principles of the chain of survival which provides that effective care for cardiac emergencies requires the following: early access to emergency care, early CPR, early defibrillation and early advanced care.</P>
      <P>The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, submitted proposals to my Department recently regarding the creation of an emergency medical technician-advanced, EMT-A, grade. The PHECC has recommended that the following two-stage process be adopted to introduce advanced practice to the ambulance service: a feasibility study of standard operating procedures, SOPs, for advanced practice; an invitation to relevant bodies to submit proposals for training courses. The feasibility study is required to explore the clinical, operational and managerial issues arising from the introduction of a new clinical service to the pre-hospital emergency setting. Implementation of these proposals will require clarification of the status of the EMT-A in relation to the administration of drugs in defined clinical circumstances. The PHECC has identified the core group of drugs to be used in such circumstances and has established protocols for their use by EMT-As, subject to the legislative position being clarified.</P>
      <P>The submission is being examined by my Department and it will work closely with the PHECC, health boards, training bodies and medical services in ensuring the efficient introduction of advanced care services to the ambulance services.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council has made significant progress towards the introduction of competency standards for Irish doctors. The council has recently appointed a director of competence assurance. He will work with the Medical Council, the professional training bodies and an external reviewer in drawing up a structure, scheduled to come into effect in the next few years. A structure is needed because it is clearly important that doctors are able to demonstrate that competence is maintained, particularly to the public. The <Col N="693" /> details will be developed in close consultation with the key stakeholders, including doctors and their representatives, and they will be engaged in both a formal and informal way in developing the competency assessment structures.</P>
      <P>I have recently commissioned a review of the competence assurance law in jurisdictions comparable to that of Ireland and the potential implications of the Freedom of Information Act upon this process. This review is currently with my Department and therefore not available for publication in its original form until its function of informing the drafting of heads of bill for the new Medical Practitioners' Act has been discharged. The report includes an overview of the need for competence assurance, the obstacles and opportunities afforded by the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and the legislative measures enacted both in Australia and the United States to protect doctors who are either undergoing or overseeing the competence assurance process.</P>
      <P>It has proved readily possible in countries with legal traditions and freedom of information legislation analogous to Ireland's to introduce effective statutes enabling competence assurance to accommodate the broad and specific concerns of doctors and patients regarding confidentiality and legal privilege.</P>

      <P>About 15% of cigarette sales are made from vending machines. I am concerned over the unrestricted access to cigarettes from vending machines by underage persons. About 80% of all smokers become addicted before reaching 16 years of age.

      <P>Many cigarette vending machines are located in areas in premises, often out of sight of staff, where there is no form of supervision. This is unacceptable from a public health perspective. There is a need to control and restrict access to cigarette vending machines and ensure that they are suitably located on premises under direct supervision of staff. I will be addressing this problem in the new public health and tobacco Bill currently being drafted and which I hope to be in a position to publish shortly. My concerns over access to cigarette machines by underage persons and the need for tighter controls in this area have been made clear to the representative body of the cigarette machine operators. It is not possible to indicate precisely when the new restrictions in this area will be introduced.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>It will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61million was for the orthodontic initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority has advised me of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: an additional consultant orthodontist has been appointed; the recruitment of another two consultant orthodontists is currently in train; two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more; the recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed; two of the managers will commence duty in July 2001 and the third will take up duty in August 2001; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been <Col N="699" /> completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards is being organised; a competition to fill the posts of dental hygienist in the area health boards will commence shortly; the previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James' Hospital unit has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a locum basis; a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St James' Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed; the Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital; validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress; agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists from the ERHA will commence training in 2001. The initiative in the ERHA will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>The proposal from the ERHA for a grant-in aid scheme was approved by my Department. I am informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that the working group established in the Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, to report on the scheme's implementation are continuing to consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the legal and operational implications of the scheme. The authority expect to have the scheme in place at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <Quest>the number of personal assistants in each health board area; and the amount allocated to each health board for personal assistants' services from 1995 to date in 2001.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18020/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently two main non-statutory agencies providing personal assistance services throughout the country, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Centre for Independent Living through its 26 branches nationwide. While the Irish Wheelchair Association has developed this service in partnership with the health boards and is funded by the boards to provide the service on its behalf, historically, the Centre for Independent Living has provided the personal assistant service, using primarily the FÁS community employment scheme and, to a lesser extent, funding provided by the health boards. Between these two agencies it is estimated that currently there are in the region of 510 individuals employed as personal assistants in Ireland providing a service to approximately 379 leaders. This figure does not include the personal assistance services being put in place in 2001-02. Exact information as to the breakdown of personal assistants in each health board area is not available at this time. This information has been requested from the health boards and will be furnished to the Deputy when available.</P>
      <P>In relation to funding allocated to the personal assistance service, I would like to advise the Deputy that my policy is to develop the range of services as a whole, in accordance with the amount of funding available, to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible. This range of services includes respite care, day care and home support services, which includes home helps, home care attendants and personal assistant services. The provision of a service is most appropriately based on an individual's needs, which may not always be met by a personal assistance service. The amount allocated by an individual health board in any year is decided in the context of local needs and in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and consumers are represented on the co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>Between 1995 and 1996, a total of £3.31 million ongoing revenue was provided for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This funding was primarily targeted at the development of therapy services, respite services and residential services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> In 1997, funding of just over £1 million was provided for the development of services, of which £56,000 was identified for home support/personal assistance services, £30,000 by the North-Eastern Health Board and £26,000 by the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office in June 1997, this Government has allocated additional funding of just over £107 million for the maintenance and development of services, including the full range of home support services, to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Between 1998 and 1999, the allocation of funding to home support services, including personal assistance services was decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees. In 2000, a sum of £3 million, with a full year cost of £6 million, was identified to the boards for the development of personal assistance services and this year I decided that £5 million with a full year cost of £10 million in the year 2002 is to be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million with a full year cost of £6 million for personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>The following table shows approximately how additional ongoing revenue funding has been allocated by and to the health boards for the development of home support services, including personal assistance services since 1998.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database Development Committee, on which the Department, the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector are represented, is currently developing a set of recommendations for the establishment of a national database. When complete, the database will provide information on the number of individuals with physical or sensory disabilities either in receipt of or requiring specialised health and personal social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> The recommendations of the committee are being tested in phase one implementation of the database which is currently under way in four community care areas around the country. It is envisaged that the committee's report will be submitted to the Department later this year and that the database will be rolled out nationally in the following months. Until such a time as this database is established, I regret that there is no statistical information available relating to the numbers of children with physical and/or sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>Information in relation to the numbers of children with an intellectual disability is currently available from the national intellectual disability database, which was established in 1995, in relation to the following years, 1996, 1998 and 1999. Data in relation to 2000 will be available within the next few weeks and 2001 later this year. I will be forwarding details of the breakdown by health board region in respect of 1996, 1998 and 1999 to the Deputy within the next few days.</P>
    <P>While the needs of some persons with autism are included on the national intellectual disability database, the database would not give an overall picture of the needs of this population group. It provides information on the numbers, ages and level of intellectual disability in respect of persons entered on the database and details of current levels of service provision, together with current and future needs over a five year period. It does not provide epidemiological information. In order to improve the level of information available to the Department and the boards and to ensure that appropriate response measures are being developed, the Department is currently discussing with the boards the establishment of an information system, which will provide this data. These discussions are at an early stage, but it is hoped that significant progress can be made this year in progressing this matter.</P>

      <P>Consumption of tobacco increases the risk of mortality and morbidity from a wide range of illnesses. These include cancers, diseases of the heart and circulatory system and respiratory conditions.</P>
      <P>Estimated figures on the number of deaths from smoking are provided in the publication &ldquo;Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000&rdquo; by Richard Peto and others. The most recent year available in this publication is 1995 and it indicates that an estimated 20% of deaths, that is, 5,881 persons, in Ireland in that year were due to smoking. This estimate is based on an indirect method which uses the results of epidemiological studies of mortality in smokers versus non-smokers in the United States to assign proportions of total mortality due to tobacco for each relevant cause of death.</P>
      <P>Similar proportions are not available for morbidity and it is therefore not possible to estimate with any precision the share of hospitalisations due to smoking. The following table sets out the numbers of hospital discharges for conditions regarded as smoking related. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these figures since they include all in-patient hospitalisation from the specified illnesses irrespective of whether they were due to smoking. It should also be noted that persons admitted to hospital more than once in a given year for a particular illness will be counted separately in the statistics for each episode. This information is collected through the hospital in-patient inquiry, HIPE, system which covers all publicly funded acute hospitals.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition&rdquo;, SLÁN, and &ldquo;Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children&rdquo;, HBSC, survey provides data on the percentage of cigarette smokers by gender and age. In general the prevalence of smoking is slightly higher among males, 32%, than females, 31%, and when further categorised by age the youngest female age group, 18 to 34 years, exhibited a significantly high rate of 40%. Overall these findings are similar to patterns in UK based health and lifestyle surveys.</P>
      <P>To address the prevalence of smoking in this country, the health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of anti-smoking initiatives. The current anti-smoking campaign &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; emphasises the positive effect quitting smoking can have on the individual and was launched in December 1998. The campaign involves national and local initiatives which offer support for those people wishing to give up smoking. The campaign was developed in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional element of this campaign has been developed to target the growing numbers of female teenagers who continue to take up smoking. While it is part of the &ldquo;Break the Habit For Good&rdquo; programme, it is a specific initiative designed with a special focus. The campaign concentrates on issues which are more immediately important to young women such as their physical well-being. The simple message of this campaign is that smokers are less attractive and it uses a range of &lsquo;anti-cosmetics' presented by a character called &ldquo;Nico&rdquo;, who highlights the negative effects smoking can have on physical appearance, for example, yellowed teeth and wrinkled skin. The &ldquo;Nico&rdquo; campaign uses TV, radio and outdoor <Col N="706" /> advertising to highlight the unappealing aspects of smoking. Both of these campaigns are ongoing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tobacco use and in particular cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable illness in the country. Tobacco is a significant burden on individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. Our success in improving the health status of the nation is linked to reducing further the level of tobacco usage and in particular preventing young persons from starting to smoke. If the increase in tobacco use by young persons can be reversed we can make considerable progress towards a tobacco free society.</P>
      <P>The priorities of Government policy in this area are outlined in reports such as &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society&rdquo;, &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo; and the Health Promotion Strategy, 2000-2005. Anti-smoking campaigns and initiatives are by far the most important single-dimensional programme in our health promotion unit's schedule. The following are some of the initiatives under way at present.</P>
      <P>The most recent anti-smoking campaign &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; was launched in association with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards. This campaign takes a slightly different approach to previous campaigns and emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. The campaign involves national and local initiatives, which offers support for those people wishing to give up smoking. The budget for anti smoking initiatives for 2000 was £1.276 million and £1.5 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>The Nico campaign was developed in 2000 as part of the &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; campaign to target the growing number of young teenage girls, particularly in social class 5 and 6, who are smoking or who are starting to smoke. This anti-smoking campaign targets young females and emphasises the negative effects smoking can have on physical appearance, for example, stained teeth and wrinkled skin &ndash; the storyline is there is nothing sexy about smoking. The media used are TV, radio, outdoor and newspaper advertising. Television is a proven useful resource in accessing young people. Strategically located outdoor sites &ndash; such as those adjacent to schools and colleges complement the TV and radio ads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broad based public awareness campaigns can be successful but the best prospect of reducing the number of people, especially young people, from stopping smoking or not starting is a targeted approach. In this regard, initiatives such as the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme are particularly important. Since September 2000 an SPHE programme is offered at junior cycle level, to post primary schools nation<Col N="707" /> wide through a partnership between my Department, regional health boards and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Social, personal and health education is a broad based health education programme which aims to enhance the self-esteem and decision making skills of young people using experiential learning methodologies. The implementation of this programme will ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach between health boards and the Department of Education and Science at regional level in a way that has never formally existed before. The Department of Health and Children is fully committed to ensuring that this process is a success and that a secure place will be established for health education within the school system to complement the work that has already taken place in many health boards.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of the out of school setting for delivering health messages to young people. The Department of Health and Children has again teamed with the Department of Education and Science and also with the National Youth Council of Ireland to provide a wide range of health promotion training for the youth sector through the national youth health programme. This programme aims to promote the notion of a health promotion youth service thereby ensuring that the messages young people receive in school are mirrored elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In March of last year I launched the report &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society&rdquo; and following on from that a number of recommendations have been implemented.</P>
    <P>Significant steps were taken in July of last year when tobacco advertising, other than limited retail and trade advertising, was ended. Sponsorship by tobacco companies was also ended. Banning tobacco advertising has the effect of reducing the numbers of people, particularly young people, taking up smoking.</P>
    <P>An EU wide ban on all forms of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products is necessary if we are to reduce children's inducement to tobacco products. I was very disappointed that the EU directive banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship was annulled by the European Court of Justice last October. However, I have indicated our total support to the EU for a new directive which was recently announced by Commissioner Byrne.</P>
    <P>We must stop the predatory marketing practices of the tobacco industry to ensure that today's children will not be the future victims of the tobacco epidemic. The office of tobacco control will have an important role to play in monitoring the activities of the tobacco industry in this area and in commissioning research into the marketing practices of the industry. The office will be established on a statutory basis in the new Public Health and Tobacco Bill being drafted.</P>
    <P>Following the ending of sponsorship of events and activities by tobacco companies last year I provided funding for sponsorship of the Irish <Col N="708" /> Masters Snooker Tournament in 2001 totalling £200,000. A similar amount will be provided in 2002 and 2003. Health sponsorship of this prestigious international event will further highlight the healthy anti-smoking message and promote a tobacco free society. The extensive television coverage of the event involving many well known young snooker stars brought home to viewers, especially young people, the positive aspects of not taking up smoking and of quitting smoking. The message is consistent with Government approved health policy on tobacco and health.</P>
    <P>Additional resources totalling £1 million have been made available to health boards this year to recruit additional staff to improve enforcement and compliance with the law in the area of tobacco control. I have made nicotine replacement therapy available to all medical card holders who smoke since 1 April this year.</P>
    <P>The age limit for sale of tobacco products to young persons has recently been raised from 16 years to 18 years of age and the maximum fine for persons convicted of selling tobacco products to under-age persons has been raised from £500 to £2,000 on foot of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001. This will act as a further deterrent to retailers.</P>
    <P>I am concerned over passive smoking and I will introduce new measures to provide for increased protection for persons from environmental tobacco smoke. The new Public Health and Tobacco Bill will introduce a range of measures to further the recommendations contained in the report &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society&rdquo; launched with Government approval last year. These measures will include prohibiting sale of cigarettes in packets of less than 20, ending of instore advertising and promotions which are directed largely at underage persons and registration of all tobacco retail outlets.</P>
    <P>A new tobacco research function will be established soon which will support the development of a tobacco free society. The main aims of this initiative will be to promote and develop academic excellence in tobacco and health studies and advance public health largely through research into tobacco marketing. The office of tobacco control will be closely involved in this initiative.</P>
    <P>A new EU directive was adopted by the European Parliament on 15 May this year on the sale, marketing and manufacturing of tobacco products. The directive sets out rules based on scientific advice on key issues such as additives, addictive substances, health warnings and misleading claims evidence. Transposition and implementation of the directive <i>via</i> national law will further advise and warn consumers and third parties of the dangers to health of smoking.</P>
    <P>Public health success in reducing tobacco use requires activity on all fronts. When we have these additional legislative measures in place and the office of tobacco control is placed on a statutory footing and with the additional resources being made available for health promotion activi<Col N="709" /> ties, research and enforcement activities, I believe that there will be a reduction in use of tobacco products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 to 242, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement <Col N="710" /> between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
    <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120 and £150 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
    <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Article 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permits health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)( No. 3) Act, 1996. I am aware that the issue of paying enhanced subventions has been raised in the Southern Health Board area and, in this regard, officials of my Department are in regular contact with the board's officials to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the course of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the individual cases raised by the Deputy, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to investigate these cases and respond directly to the deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Individuals with an acquired injury form part of a larger client group, known as the &ldquo;Young Chronic Sick&rdquo;.

      <P>Just over £92 million is being provided under the national development plan for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities over the years 2001-2006, including the development of &ldquo;step down&rdquo; rehabilitation and long-term care service for people with acquired brain injury.</P>
      <P>The need for additional rehabilitation beds has been identified in the review of bed capacity. This review is at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future. I accept that there is a need to provide facilities which can meet the needs of patients requiring access to rehabilitation services. These include selected groups with specific conditions, such as acquired brain injury, who require continuing care in a setting appropriate to their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Until December 2000 my Department published statistics on the incidence of HIV in Ireland based on data provided by the virus reference laboratory. Since that date the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, has taken over responsibility for publishing these statistics. The main rationale for this is that the NDSC will have the epidemiological expertise to interpret and report on data as it has employed a surveillance scientist for this purpose. HIV statistics will be published twice yearly by the NDSC, as was previously the case when my Department reported the figures.</P>
      <P>Ireland provides its statistics on HIV to a European HIV reporting system, based in Paris. These statistics are accessible through the website, www.ceses.org. Statistics from other European countries are also available on this website.</P>
      <P>In Ireland data has been broken down and reported as cases in the eastern region and cases in the rest of the country. The reason for this is because in some areas incidence of HIV is quite low, sometimes with just one case being reported in any given reporting period. In order to protect the anonymity of those with HIV a decision was made, with the approval of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, which is chaired by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to report in this manner. Latest statistics show that from July to December 2000, 78% of HIV antibody positive cases occurred in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that this new reporting procedure will enhance statistics available on HIV and allow us to plan an effective response for people who are HIV positive, without compromising their anonymity. Of course, anyone who is HIV positive can at any time get information and support <Col N="715" /> from their general practitioner or infectious diseases clinic on their condition and treatment.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 49 on 30 May 2001 in relation to the quality of drinking water in public water supply schemes and in group water supply schemes, including source protection measures, which are of relevance in so far as these schemes or sources may serve as sources for bottled waters. Information is not available in my Department as to the sources of bottled waters.</P>
      <P>Responsibility at ministerial level in relation to bottled waters is assigned primarily to the Minister for Health and Children who has made regulations, SI No. 461 of 1998, in relation to the labelling, treatment and trade requirements for natural mineral waters. These regulations come within the scope of food legislation in the context of the functions of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Certain functions are assigned to sanitary authorities at present under regulations made in 1988, SI No. 81 of 1988, in relation to the monitoring of bottled waters, other than natural mineral waters.  </P>
      <P>I am not aware of any particular legislation which imposes a requirement to obtain a licence for the production of bottled water. A comprehensive voluntary standard, ISO 432, 2001, in relation to bottled waters is operated by the National Safety Standards Authority of Ireland and relates, <i>inter alia</i>, to source monitoring, source protection and management, quality testing, packaging and labelling.</P>

      <P>Sligo County Council's non-national road grant allocation of £6.625 million in 2001 represents a 15% increase on the <Col N="716" /> initial 2000 allocation of £5.768 million and an increase of 59% on its 1997 grant of £4.168 million. The council's allocation per kilometre in 2001 is £2,599.</P>
      <P>In determining non-national road grant allocations for 2001, the objective has been to resource all local authorities, including Sligo County Council, appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. This process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement conditions, traffic volumes, length of road network and suitability in relation to criteria for EU co-financing. This multiplicity of criteria, together with the variable impact from year to year of project specific schemes, necessarily entails divergence between local authorities in grants per kilometre under the non-national roads programme.</P>

This restriction applies for the period of the provisional licence in category A and for a period of two years after the grant of a category A driving licence.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are considered desirable in the interests of road safety and against the background of the disproportionately high accident-fatality rate of motorcyclists in Ireland compared to other categories of road users.

Consultants were subsequently appointed to prepare the NRA <i>Design Manual for Roads and Bridges</i> and the NRA <i>Road Geometry Handbook</i>, which, <i>inter alia</i>, address the use and positioning of crash barriers. These documents have now been submitted to my Department by the NRA for my approval, as required under the Roads Act, 1993.

Because of the scale and complexity of the Act, and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date, I have made three commencement orders bringing a number of Parts of the Act into force.

I propose to commence section 48 of the Act together with the other control of development provisions in Part III. Regulations are currently being finalised by my Department which will enable me to bring these provisions of the Act into force.

      <P>The planning Acts specifically allow for conditions to be attached to planning permissions about the giving of security, the phasing and completion of works and occupation of structures. Effective use of such conditions by local authorities, and follow-up enforcement action, can do much to obviate the kind of problems that arise in unfinished estates.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of planning control is a matter for planning authorities. In addition, it is open to any person to seek a court order under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, as amended, requiring compliance with conditions laid down by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, includes much strengthened provisions regarding the enforcement of planning law and will enable a planning authority to refuse to grant permission to a developer based on past non-performance, subject to the consent of the High Court. The 2000 Act also provides for new requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of housing estates. Where an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of the local authority, the authority will be required to take it in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so. Where an estate is unfinished, and the seven year period for taking enforcement action has expired, and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will be obliged to take the estate in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to commence these provisions together with the general control of development provisions in the Act. Regulations are currently being finalised by my Department which will enable me to bring these provisions of the Act into force. Some of these regulations require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="721" /> I have also undertaken to bring the regulations in their entirety before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government for discussion prior to bringing them into force.</P>
    <P>I propose to submit a draft of the regulations for approval within the next month.</P>

      <P>Dublin Fire Brigade provide the major part of the emergency ambulance service in the Dublin area. In order to ensure appropriate training for their personnel I understand they entered into an agreement with the North-Eastern University, Boston USA, to provide emergency medical technician training, EMT. Six weeks of EMT training is provided as part of the Dublin Fire Brigade recruit induction training. This course is funded by the corporation and there is no cost to the participants. I have no proposal to provide funding for this.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to an open EMT course which the North-Eastern University provides as part of its activity on the Dublin Fire Brigade training campus. This six week course costs £1,500. The course is apparently mostly taken up by persons outside the fire service as career enhancing training. While the course is provided on the Dublin Fire Brigade campus as part of a contract arrangement, and sometimes uses Dublin Fire Brigade personnel who are qualified EMT instructors, it is not provided by Dublin Fire Brigade. I have no resources available to me to fund such a course.</P>

      <P>I have noted the issues raised in the submission regarding the thatching industry. My Department assists in the preservation of thatching through the payment of grants to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs and I have introduced significant improvements to the grant levels under the scheme. The basic maximum grant was increased in 1999 from £2,400 to £3,000 and from £3,600 to £4,500 for houses on specified offshore islands. The grants may meet two-thirds of the approved cost of works, subject to the maximum limits.</P>

In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works, again subject to the maximum grant limits.</P>

      <P>Full-rate child dependant allowance &ndash; CDA &ndash; is payable where the claimant is in receipt of an allowance for a qualified adult, has no spouse or partner or is separated. <Col N="725" /> Where a qualified adult allowance is not payable by virtue of the fact that the spouse or partner is not wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant, CDA is payable at half-rate. Regulations specify the circumstances in which a person may be regarded to be wholly or mainly maintaining another person for the purposes of entitlement to qualified adult allowance &ndash; QAA. The spouse or partner can earn up to £70 per week and the claimant can retain the full relevant rate of QAA. Where the spouse or partner has income of over £70 per week, the QAA is withdrawn on a tapered basis until earnings reach £145 per week. However, the 50% reduction of the CDA does not take effect until the spouse or partner's income exceeds £145 per week. Where the spouse or partner is claiming a social welfare payment in his/her own right, a CDA is payable at half-rate in respect of each child to both the claimant and his/her partner.</P>
      <P>The policy direction of successive Governments has been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, rather than increasing CDAs, thus ensuring that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent(s). This policy was given new impetus in this year's Budget. The increases that came into effect this month constitute a full year investment of £330 million in the child benefit scheme. Most notably, this is only the first of three years of increases which will see investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003. That is almost a three fold increase. By the end of this period, the higher rate of child benefit will be £146 per month and the lower rate will be £117.50. A family with four children will, in 2003, be receiving £120 per week in child benefit. The relative importance of CDAs will clearly decline in the years ahead. In the circumstances, I have no plans to provide for full rate CDAs for the group referred to by the Deputy who I believe are already adequately catered for by the arrangements I have outlined.</P>

      <P>As previously stated in my reply to Question No. 484 of 1 May 2001, in October 1999 my Department received an application from Mayo County Council for funding to assist with the cost of constructing 55 metre slipways at Doran's Point on the mainland and at Gob na Dubh on Inishbiggle together with associated road improvement and coastal protection works, including those to which the Deputy refers, at an estimated total cost of £315,000. The issue of preservation of the ESB lines is not a matter for my Department but is, naturally, a matter for the ESB. After discussions with Mayo County Council and, in view of the major expenditure of £1.45 million which has been approved by my Department for the construction of a cable car serving this island, the county council was requested to submit a revised application to include the provision of 30 metre slipways at Gob na Dubh and Doran's Point and also the associated coastal protection works.

I am further informed that, when not open, PACB and call diversion systems are in operation and linked to the district headquarters at Togher Garda station.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many countries, including Ireland, have a web of laws that protect certain aspects of privacy. Several common law torts and a series of common law crimes and statutory offences are relevant in the context of surveillance. However, as scientific advances and technological developments have opened up new opportunities and possibilities for surveillance, <Col N="730" /> concerns in relation to the invasion of privacy have been increasing.</P>
      <P>In so far as the use of closed circuit television cameras are concerned, I am pleased to say that legislative changes are pending in two important areas. Firstly, as the House is aware, I have published the Private Security Services Bill, 2001, with a view to establishing the private security authority. The role of the authority will be to operate a licensing system in order to control and supervise companies and individuals providing security services. All suppliers and installers of security equipment, including closed circuit television cameras, and persons monitoring such security equipment, will come within the scope of the Act and it will be an offence to provide such a service without a licence. The aim is to maintain and improve standards across the private security industry. Applicants for licences will have to provide such references as to the applicant's character, financial position and competence as the authority may require. The authority may investigate any security service being provided by any person and will also investigate complaints against licensees in relation to the provision of security services.</P>
      <P>The second legislative initiative relates to data protection. In the coming weeks, I will publish a Bill to amend the Data Protection Act, 1988. This Bill will strengthen existing provisions in relation to processing of personal data and it will involve protection of information obtained by means of closed circuit television cameras. In addition, my Department, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Garda are currently in discussion with a view to drawing up a code of practice for this whole area which may eventually be given the force of law under the Data Protection Act.</P>
      <P>The installation of closed circuit cameras and other security equipment on buildings is, of course, subject to the normal requirements concerning planning permission. However, this type of development may be exempt from the requirement to seek planning permission where, in accordance with section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, it affects only the interior of the structure, other than a protected structure, or does not materially affect the external appearance of the structure so as to render such appearance inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures. Any dispute about whether a particular security installation is exempted development may be referred to An Bord Pleanála for determination. No special planning guidelines or criteria have been issued in respect of these installations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tallaght is one of ten areas that are included in the first tranche of Garda CCTV systems to be introduced following my announcement of the expansion of Garda CCTV systems. The other areas &ndash; in alphabetical order &ndash; are Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems and will be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems commences. I am advised by the Garda authorities that a project meeting concerning the installation of a Garda CCTV system in Tallaght was held on 12 June 2001. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Office of Public Works, the ESB and Tallaght Chamber of Commerce. Following the meeting, a list of camera locations for the greater Tallaght area is being drawn up but it is not intended to place cameras in residential areas.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that the CCTV Advisory Committee &ndash; established by the Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications &ndash; and Garda management in the areas where CCTV is in operation and areas where CCTV systems are planned are currently examining the monitoring implications for the Garda authorities of the CCTV systems and will make recommendations to the Commissioner in due course. I am advised that local Garda management is continuously in contact with local groups and would be anxious to strengthen ties with all groups, including local estate management groups, in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that a CCTV system has been operating successfully in the Moyross area of Limerick since 1998. The system is in place in co-operation between Limerick Corporation and the Moyross Development Company Limited. It has been responsible for the reduction of crime, criminal damage and anti-social behaviour. The cameras which are located and monitored by staff from Moyross Community Centre have provided assistance in the investigation and successful prosecution of offenders involved in serious incidents. There is also close liaison between the Gardaí at Mayorstone station and the personnel in charge of and operating the CCTV system in Moyross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> I am conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date in providing video recording systems in Garda stations; if he proposes the installation of video recording systems in prisoner reception areas and in cell areas as proposed by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors; the progress he envisages will be made by the end of 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the installation of audio/video recording facilities in approximately 220 interview rooms will meet their requirements. Approximately 150 Garda stations are involved. A major programme to install the necessary equipment will get under way shortly and I understand from the Garda authorities that they anticipate that the recording facilities will be provided at all the relevant locations before the end of the year. I am aware that proposals have been made for the installation of video recording facilities in the reception and cell areas of Garda stations. While this is a development I will bear in mind, my own view, at this stage, is that it would be better to have experience of the new audio/video arrangements currently being provided in relation to interviews before any decisions are taken regarding further recording.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management are working closely with Fingal County Council and local residents in order to address the problem of anti-social behaviour in the relevant housing estates. In this regard, I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers. I understand that the Garda Síochána and Fingal County Council are currently considering measures to restrict access to green areas, where much anti-social and criminal activities occur. In addition, I understand that the council is considering the introduction of by-laws similar to the intoxicating liquor by-laws introduced by Dublin Corporation in 2000, which have proved to be successful in areas where they are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the operational response of the Garda Síochána, eight community gardaí are allocated full-time to the areas in question. In addition, a Garda mobile patrol is dedicated to these areas from 2 p.m. to 4 a.m. daily. The level of mobile policing is increased over the extended weekend period by two vans. I am assured by the <Col N="737" /> Garda authorities that the level of policing is adequate to deal with the problems of the area.</P>

It should be noted that Dublin postal areas do not correlate to Garda boundaries. All Garda personnel allocated to Blanchardstown Garda station are committed to investigating crime and community policing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Victims Commissioner, Mr. John Wilson, in his report &ldquo;A Place and a Name&rdquo; stated in respect of Mr Ludlow's case:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> I am aware of the family's strong wish that the full truth of the case should be brought to light. I am swayed by their argument that a criminal trial will not necessarily bring out the full facts of the case. I recommend that an inquiry should be conducted into this case along the lines of the inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in principle in September 1999 to establish an inquiry into the case of Mr. Ludlow as well as the bombings in Dublin-Monaghan and Dundalk. This proposed inquiry &ndash; which would be carried out on the same basis as the present inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings &ndash; has not found favour with the relatives of Mr. Ludlow or their legal representatives. In the circumstances, I am considering how best to progress the matter, and I shall put proposals to this end before Government as soon as I am in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>In so far as other cases are concerned, the report of the Victims Commission recommended &ldquo;that the Government, taking heed of the need to preserve confidentiality and safety of informants, should, on request from the families of victims, produce reports on the investigations of murders arising from the conflict over the past 30 years where no one has been made amenable.&rdquo;  I am currently preparing an implementation plan in respect of the report's recommendations which I hope to bring to Government shortly.</P>

All of the applications were assessed in accordance with assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme.

      <P>Under the 2001 Sports Capital Programme, I allocated a total of £40 million to 680 projects around the country, of which £9,571,000 was allocated to 96 projects located in County Dublin. A schedule listing the allocations follows. In the past three years, under the Sports Capital Programmes 1999 to 2001, inclusive, I have allocated £26,933,700 to projects in County Dublin. The allocation in 1999 was £5,093,000 and in 2000 it was £12,269,700, including allocations for regional and national projects located in Dublin. For example, a grant of £4.1 million was allocated to Fingal County Council towards the construction of a national indoor athletics facility at Santry Stadium.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>A major tourism marketing reassurance campaign, with a total budget of £10 million, has been designed by Bord Fáilte in consultation with the industry and is under way in key markets. The reassurance marketing campaign consists of special media advertising, trade reassurance measures and special promotional visits, including my own recent visit to the United States. In the course of that visit, I undertook over 30 interviews with television and radio as well as 18 print media interviews. I also attended trade and media events in Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and New York and had three industry meetings. My trip to the United States was heavily supported by the tourist trade both at home and in the U.S. and the industry saw it as a significant contribution in counteracting the negative publicity and confusion about foot and mouth which was widespread there.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte's April estimate of projected losses of out-of-state tourism earnings is of the order of £500 million for 2001. These estimates did not take into account the impact of the subsequent reassurance campaign. Bord Fáilte will be re-evaluating these projections as the 2001 season progresses. These initial projections are at the high end of losses and this is borne out by the fact that since the launch of the reassurance campaign there have been some signs of recovery in the market place.</P>

      <P>Following the public advertising of the 2001 Sport Capital Programme, in excess of 1,450 applications were received, including an application from the organisation in question. All of the applications were assessed in accordance with assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme. Following the assessment process, the organisation in question was unsuccessful on this occasion and this decision, together with a copy of the assessment conducted on the application, was conveyed to the organisation by letter dated 13 June 2001. I expect to be advertising the 2002 sports capital programme before the end of this year and it will be open to the organisation to apply for funding under that programme.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners. The staffing warranted, at the school referred to by the Deputy, for the 2001-02 school year based on an enrolment of 171 pupils on 30 September 2000 is a principal and five mainstream class teachers. In addition, the school has the services of a concessionary post because of the school's disadvantaged status, a learning support teacher, a resource teacher and a home school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>The board of management recently wrote to the primary payments section of my Department stating that its projected enrolment in September 2001 will be 189 pupils. The board was advised in writing on 31 May 2001 that, based on this enrolment, it is not entitled to an additional post under maximum class size guidelines. An enrolment of 204 pupils on 30 September 2001 would entitle the school to an additional post for the 2001-02 school year.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 369 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 355 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has a learning support teacher and a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule, to which I referred, is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases, an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department, if the schools meets the defined criteria.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, at this time, it is not possible to sanction the retention of 13th mainstream teaching post for the school year 2001-02 as the school's September 2000 enrolment does not meet the retention requirement of 360 pupils.</P>
      <P>The staffing schedule for primary schools is designed to ensure that schools will operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils by reference to the enrolment of 30 September of the previous school year. The organisation of classes and the allocation of class teachers within a school is a matter for the board of management. It is also a matter for the board to apply the general class size guidelines.</P>

      <P>The teacher allocation in the vocational sector is made on an overall vocational education scheme basis.

      <P>It is a matter for each VEC to plan and provide an appropriate curriculum to meet overall pupil needs and to allocate teaching resources to individual schools in the scheme from within its approved teacher allocation.</P>
      <P>County Cork VEC has been granted its normal teacher allocation entitlement for 2001-02. In addition, my Department, following consideration of an appeal made by the VEC, approved a further allocation as a curricular concession.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern among young teachers at the high incidence of part-time or temporary whole-time posts in post-primary schools; the plans he has to create additional permanent posts to be filled by teachers already employed part-time or on a temporary basis in schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than 24,000 whole-time teacher equivalent posts allocated to second level schools in the current school year. The majority of the posts are filled on a permanent whole-time basis. According to records in my Department, approximately 1,500 teachers are employed in a temporary whole-time capacity and 2,000 teachers are employed in eligible part-time positions in the second level school sector.</P>
      <P>Vacancies in schools arising from career breaks, approved leave of absence, or secondments and concessionary posts, which are allocated in excess of a school's normal quota of posts, may be filled only in a temporary or part-time capacity. In addition, to ensure that schools have the flexibility to meet the curricular needs of their students, particularly in minority subject areas, it is necessary for them to appoint temporary or part-time teachers.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the eligible part-time teacher, EPT, scheme, EPTs who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year, where the same teaching hours are required. Most teachers who are initially employed as EPTs subsequently apply for and are appointed to permanent teaching posts in their subject area. They are entitled to incremental and pension credit for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures have been taken over the past number of years to address the job security of temporary teachers. The PCW agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers provided for the conversion, on a once-off basis, of certain posts from temporary to permanent status and for an increase in the number of allocated posts which school authorities may fill on a permanent basis. <Col N="755" /> The agreement also provided for the establishment of a qualifications committee to determine suitable qualifications for appointments to permanent teaching posts in vocational preparation and training courses. This committee has recently agreed qualifications and experience requirements in the areas of beauty therapy, hairdressing, veterinary studies and arts administration. This will enable teachers with these qualifications to be appointed in a fully qualified capacity and apply for suitable permanent posts. The work of this committee is continuing.</P>
    <P>The Irish language requirement has been removed for the generality of teaching posts at second level. This has enabled teachers, who were previously regarded as ineligible, to apply for temporary or permanent teaching posts.</P>
    <P>A review of the EPT scheme for VEC teachers has recently been carried out and improved arrangements in regard to EPT contracts have been agreed. Vocational education committees now have the option of allocating EPT hours over more than one school and EPTs whose hours fall below the threshold, 11 hours per week, required for a contract will be offered any residual hours which may be available.</P>
    <P>The job security of temporary teachers is also related to the number and type of posts available. In this regard the position at second level has significantly improved in recent years. In 1999, 225 additional posts were created. In the current school year 1,000 additional posts were created and a further 400 new posts will be created over the next two years in accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>In the context of school provision in the Lisdoonvarna and Ennistymon areas, my Department has decided that, on balance, a school should be allowed to continue in its own right in Lisdoonvarna, even though there are grounds for actively considering consolidation with Ennistymon. The request to replace the existing facilities in Lisdoonvarna will be considered by my Department under normal value for money and prioritisation criteria.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that it is fully informed, my Department issued an educational worksheet to the school authority on 11 June 2001 for completion, based on a long-term projected enrolment figure of 250. On receipt of this completed form, my Department's building unit will be in a position to draw up a schedule of accommodation for agreement with the school authority, which will form the basis of further consideration of the request for new accommodation.</P>

      <P>Teachers trained in another member state of the European Union, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, must have their qualifications assessed and accepted by my Department before they are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in national schools.</P>
      <P>In addition, to be eligible for recognition as a teacher in any capacity in national schools applicants must be competent to teach English and to teach the various aspects of the curriculum through the medium of the English language. My Department reserves the right to require applicants to establish their competence in the English language through a test conducted and assessed by a departmental inspector.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy it was necessary to conduct such a test, which added to the time required to complete the assessment process.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to state that this assessment process has now been completed and a letter confirming the granting of provisional and restricted recognition as a primary teacher will be issuing to the applicant shortly.</P>
