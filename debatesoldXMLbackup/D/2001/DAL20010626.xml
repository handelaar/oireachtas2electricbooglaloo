      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, acting on the advice of the expert group on foot and mouth disease, decided to postpone the census of population scheduled for Sunday, 29 April 2001 until Sunday, 28 April 2002. The Government took this decision following detailed discussions between the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the expert group on foot <Col N="2" /> and mouth disease and Departments. While alternative methods and dates for conducting the census, which would minimise the risk of spreading FMD, were considered in detail, the Government concluded that it had no option but to postpone the census for 12 months.</P>
    <P>The 400 supervisory field staff, who had been working for three to six months on the preparations, were retained in their positions for a brief period to wind down the deferred census. Their contracts have now been terminated. They will subsequently be invited to resume their positions early next year for the 2002 census. Similarly, the 4,000 enumerators who were due to commence work on the 2001 census on 26 March will also be approached for the 2002 census. Some of the additional headquarters staff employed for the preparation of the census will be redeployed in the normal way to other Departments. The remaining staff will be retained to ensure an orderly winding down of the 2001 census and the smooth running of the 2002 census, with particular emphasis on speeding up the processing and dissemination of results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that the Minister <Col N="3" /> of State would not dare speak for the Taoiseach while he is in New York, I presume the Government will not call an election close to 28 April 2002 in order that the census will not, once again, be aborted. Since the Minister of State assured us on radio earlier today, when we finally got to talk to each other, that&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know. It may be four years, but the Government has not grown up. Will the Minister of State indicate whether the pattern of the census will revert to the five year sequence? In other words, will the census after the next one take place four years later, not five, so as to continue the sequence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that it will revert to the normal five year cycle, from 2002 to 2007 etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not what I asked. Will the next census after 2002 take place four years later in order that one can have five year sequences for the purpose of assessing trends?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. We will return to five-year cycles then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the cancellation of the census was unavoidable, but I am concerned about the impact of the lack of census figures on the Government's proposals for a national spatial plan. Figures derived from a census play a huge role in the planning of spatial development by local authorities. Will such planning be affected by the absence of census figures during the next 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not specifically, although it obviously would be better to have up to date figures from a census. The quarterly national household survey gives a lot of information, as do the regular surveys and studies carried out by the CSO, which supplies us with quarterly and monthly figures relating to production, sales and other matters. Figures from the 1996 census remain available, so I am confident that enough statistics are available to develop the national spatial plan. Next year's census will further assist the development of the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State clarify his reply to Deputy Quinn some moments ago? Will the census following next year's be in 2006 or 2007?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be held in 2006.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following statement. The data are taken from the 1981 and 1996 censuses. There were 79 inhabited islands in 1981, but the figure had fallen to 59 by 1996. The total island population in 1981 was 10,867, which had fallen to 9,280 by 1996, the most recent year for which figures are available.</P>

      <P>Both the number of inhabited islands and the island population have dropped significantly in recent years. The Government and its predecessor gave responsibility for policies in relation to islands to a Government Department, but the figures indicate the policies have not been successful. Is the Minister of State happy that the policies being pursued can redress the drop in population that has been presented here?</P>

      <P>The Government allocated a total of £33 million for the millennium programme in 1999-2000. The National Millennium Committee was established to advise on suitable projects for inclusion in the programme and to set up a system for supporting commemorative events at local and community levels. Funding was awarded to projects on the basis of the committee's recommendations. Almost 2,400 projects and events were supported, including flagship projects such as the millennium candle, the millennium forest, as well as projects of national and regional significance, projects celebrating the Christian jubilee, nearly 200 community-based projects and almost 2,000 commemorative events. A comprehensive information, marketing and promotion campaign was implemented in support of the programme and its projects.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2000, almost £18.5 million had been drawn down from the fund for millennium projects. A further £1.8 million has been drawn down so far as this year, bringing the total to more than £20 million. The rate of further draw-downs during this year will depend on the speed of development of the remaining projects. At this stage I expect most of the remaining projects will be in a position to request their awards in full by the end of the year. Some of the larger capital projects may take a little longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to the millennium award to Messiah XXI Productions Limited, I can confirm that since the Deputy previously raised this matter, the Secretary General of my Department met the company and gained firm assurances on the submission of its report and accounts. I can further confirm that a copy of the report and accounts covering the period 19 February 1999 to 30 September 2000 was received in the Department at <Col N="7" /> the end of January this year. I intend placing a summary of these accounts in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The decision of the National Millennium Committee to recommend to the Government an award of £700,000 of millennium funding towards the cost of the Messiah XXI project was unanimous. The committee's view was that the project was entirely suitable for inclusion in the millennium programme. It had a strong Christian theme, historical associations with our capital city and was to be broadcast on national television.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the award was to ensure the production took place and, importantly, that it would be broadcast by RTE. As with all millennium awards, the funding provided was a once-off grant, not a loan. Accordingly, the national millennium committee was not looking for a financial return. With such an ambitious project, the likelihood of it subsequently making large profits was regarded by the committee as very unlikely to say the least. The committee's principal concern was that the production would be available to be seen by as many of the population as possible and that objective was achieved.</P>
    <P>Messiah XXI Productions Limited had offered to donate a portion of its net after tax profits to Irish charities and the National Millennium Committee ensured this offer was pledged in a formal manner. As I have said previously in the House, I was not optimistic about a significant donation to charity. I will be delighted if it turns out otherwise. However, this will depend on whatever commercial success Messiah XXI Productions Limited has in selling the broadcasting rights, videos, etc. I wish the company every success in this regard. In the meantime, I have asked the millennium office to continue to monitor the situation.</P>

      <P>While the Minister of State provided a great deal of information, he did not outline whether there is any surplus in the accounts to September 2000, which he intends to place in the Oireachtas Library. Is there any prospect of profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no prospect of profit. The company is still trying to make sales of the video and CD of the production in the American market. It is extremely unlikely to make any profit on the production, as I hinted the last time we debated this issue in the House, and it will not be able to make any donation to charity, as was pledged. The company pledged to make a donation out of any profits made but it is clear from the abridged accounts in the Oireachtas Library that it is unlikely to make any such profits and, therefore, the funding is still considered a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a surplus or a deficit in the accounts the Minister of State intends to lodge in the Oireachtas Library?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a deficit so far but the company is still maintaining its sales effort in the United States of the video and CD of the production. The abridged balance sheet and income account which I have lodged in the Oireachtas Library show a deficit and, therefore, there is no obligation on the company to make a donation to charity. However, the deficit is the company's, not the State's.</P>

      <P>How many trees were planted under the trees project? Who owns the trees and what will happen to them in 20 years, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 1.4 million trees, primarily oak trees, were planted, the equivalent of one per household in the State. That was the millennium aspect to the project. All the trees were planted on land controlled by Coillte and are State-owned. Every household has a certificate and in the spirit of the millennium I do not expect 1.4 million law cases seeking ownership of trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to law cases. I presume if a citizen and family have been presented with a certificate which states they own a tree, that means they have a proprietorial right and any plans to privatise Coillte, which the Minister for Finance would love to do, would run the risk of a legal challenge. Is that a fair interpretation of the current position? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The certificates and the accompanying literature are clear that the tree is planted in the name of each household. The certificate which was sent to people states the tree was planted in the name of their family and they therefore have access to it. It is not a legal ownership of the tree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we ask the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to scramble up these trees, to do a thorough inspection of them and to report on their state of health? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apt that Deputy Quinn should make that comment because the former Deputy Ray Burke planted the temporary trees in my constituency during that famous by-election. People who got those certificates think they own a tree. Was it one big gimmick or what was its purpose? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Deputy. Ireland has been short of oak trees and it is not commercial to plant and develop them. The millennium committee took the view that restoring our native woodlands would be a good gesture to mark the passing from one century and millennium to another. To follow the theme of the millennium committee to involve as many people as possible to make it <Col N="9" /> a people's millennium, we took the decision to plant 1.4 million trees in the name of each household in the State. It was a gesture which indicated this was being done in the name of the household. I do not think anyone understood it as legal ownership. If something is sent to 1.4 million households, one can expect a flurry of correspondence. I did not receive letters or telephone calls asking me for the deeds of the site.</P>

      <P>This question addresses a serious point. Much of our legislation is phrased in archaic, out of date and convoluted language which is almost designed to confuse the general public. I do not see any sign in Bills before the House at present that we have learned any lessons. As shadow spokesperson, I am supposed to speak on some Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a boss in Guinness who used to ask his men to excavate an aperture and the men would ask if he meant to dig a hole. Our legislation uses such out of date and archaic language when we really only want to dig a hole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to make legislation more understandable and readable but, at the same time, legal language is necessary in a range of areas. It would be difficult to extract all of it from legislation. The last Interpretation Act was introduced in 1937. The interpretation section defines what is meant by a day, a weekend, a working day, Minister, etc. Instead of laying out those repeatedly in legislation, the Interpretation Acts would take those as given and would also allow for changes to be made. For example, one of the changes we examined in terms of what is contained in the report &ndash; Deputy Quinn referred to the fact that the Bill was published first &ndash; was to amend the Interpretation Bill, 2000, in respect of provisions in changing circumstances arising from a change in technology, legal policy or even changes in society between the time of the enactment of legislation and the time it comes to be interpreted because the meaning of it at that time might be different. That was approach adopted in the Interpretation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious point. Legislation drafted in the United States, for instance, contains ordinary, everyday language whereas our legislation contains language from the century before last and phrases which were first drafted in Gladstone's time are used now. From what the Minister of State said, the only legislation we will change is the Interpretation Bill, but surely we should change every Bill which comes before this House into modern, readable language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has improved. I am not sure the American model is one to be followed. They seem to have more lawyers per square inch in the United States than the rest of the world together. I presume they spend their lives interpreting legislation, so I am not sure that model is a useful one. It has been the policy of successive Governments, the Attorney General's office and the draftsman's office to minimise the amount of legal mumbo jumbo contained in legislation, but it can only be minimised. This Bill will be an important reform and will move it forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a practice recommended in the LRC report to the effect that the explanatory <Col N="11" /> memorandum, which is available on Second Stage, should be revised when the Bill is amended because many people &ndash; this is the substance of the LRC recommendation &ndash; will use the explanatory memorandum as the guide to what is contained in the Bill. If one gets the explanatory memorandum and the Bill is subsequently amended, that memorandum is deemed to be out of the date. The recommendation states that the drafters of the Bill shall also draft the explanatory memorandum and the memorandum should be amended to reflect the Bill, as amended, when it is enacted. Can the Minister of State indicate from the information available to him in his briefing whether the proposed amendments to the Interpretation Act will recommend such procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reference on my file to any such proposal but it is a top class idea because if we publish an explanatory memorandum with the Bill, by the time it has gone through all Stages in both Houses, it is often an entirely different Bill. Publishing an explanatory memorandum with the Act, therefore, might be useful. I do not know whether the legal people would have to interpret the Bill rather than the Houses which pass it. That is a point I have not considered but it is a top class idea and I will pursue it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs has met five times to date this year and is scheduled to hold its sixth meeting on Thursday, 26 July. A further four meetings &ndash; one per month &ndash; with the exception of August, are planned before the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee continues to give political direction to the national drugs strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund and the RAPID programme. The meetings provide an opportunity to review trends, to assess progress in the relevant strategies and programmes and to resolve any policy and organisational problems which may arise.</P>
      <P>At its five meetings this year, the Cabinet committee noted the progress made in implementing these initiatives which are aimed at addressing the drugs problem in a targeted manner. In particular, it has approved 11 new local drugs task force action plans and allocated £6.9 million to projects in the task force areas. It has also approved £3.7 million for 19 projects under the special premises initiative for task force areas to meet their accommodation needs, for which £10 million is available over three years &ndash; £3 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>In April the Cabinet committee also approved the new national drugs strategy, 2001-08, which was launched on 10 May. In addition, the committee has approved more than £46 million under the young people's facilities and services fund since it was established in 1998 which includes funding for 97 facility projects and 168 services projects. The primary focus of the fund is on local drug task force areas and selected urban areas &ndash; Galway, Limerick, south Cork city, Waterford and Carlow &ndash; where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new national drugs strategy is the first occasion on which all elements of drugs policy in Ireland have been brought together in a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned <Col N="13" /> across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. In addition, under each of the four pillars, a series of objectives and key performance indicators have been set with specific targets that Departments and agencies are required to meet. A series of 100 individual actions have also been developed which the relevant bodies have to carry out in order to deliver the strategy and meet its objectives.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group on drugs, which I will chair, will, in conjunction with the national drugs strategy team, establish an evaluation framework against which progress on the strategy will be measured. Furthermore, in consultation with the team, the IDG will report on progress to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs every six months. Each Department and agency will also prepare a critical implementation path for each of the actions relevant to its remit and an annual report will be produced. A mid-term evaluation of the strategy will take place in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet committee agreed to the RAPID programme which is designed to target the 25 designated urban centres with the greatest concentration of disadvantage for special support and prioritisation of the funds available under the national development plan during the first three years of the plan's implementation. The establishment of a framework for the implementation of the programme will be put in place by this Department.</P>
    <P>In each of the designated areas, a dedicated co-ordinator, working with an area implementation team, will prepare an area action plan. I am happy to report that all 25 local co-ordinators have been recruited, as has the national co-ordinator. The plans will identify the needs of each area, whether with regard to facilities, services or investment which may be delivered under the national development plan. The plans are scheduled to be completed before the end of this year. Once the plans have been completed and agreed, the front-loading of funding provided under the national development plan will be undertaken during 2002 and 2003 to meet the needs identified in each area. This Department will act as a lead Department in facilitating the cross-departmental agency response required to meet the needs identified in the area plans.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State agree that, while quite a number of targets are set in the national drugs strategy, 2001-08, regarding a number of areas, particularly the heroin crisis, there are no targets for the section that deals with minimising the harm caused to those who continue to engage in drug taking activities which put them at risk? Does he agree it is crucial that targets are set regarding those at risk, particularly from heroin addiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of transmission of HIV through intravenous drug use continues to rise, yet there is no reduction target. Similarly the rate of hepatitis C <Col N="14" /> continues to rise, yet there is no reduction target. Does the Minister of State agree there should be a target to reduce deaths caused by heroin, particularly from over-dosing, of which there were about 86 last year? Such a target should be promoted actively to reduce this terrible tragedy which struck 86 individuals, families and neighbourhoods last year. This is a dramatic statistic for a small country and these deaths are confined to a relatively small area.</P>
    <P>My second question relates to the ongoing problem of waiting lists. Does the Minister of State agree that there is a contradiction in the drugs programme? On the one hand, the Minister of State says the number of places will increase from 6,000 to 6,500 by the end of this year but, on the other, he says that immediate access for drug abusers to professional assessment and counselling by health board services, followed by commencement of treatment as deemed appropriate, is not later than one month after assessment. There is a contradiction there. The Minister of State is saying that everybody should be able to access treatment, not just 100 extra this year. Will he acknowledge that there is still a big problem concerning waiting lists? This is a big problem for those working on the ground and trying to assist heroin addicts, in particular.</P>

To conclude my question, there is a still a big problem about waiting lists. What does the Minister of State say about this? Will he come up with definitive programmes for problem drug users under 18 years of age? All workers on the ground report a big problem in this area.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding waiting lists. I meet health board representatives regularly to try to resolve this matter. I met them as recently as last week and they spelt out the new centres that will be opening. There is, therefore, positive news on that front. We have made a number of breakthroughs in locating drug treatment centres in areas which have proven to be particularly difficult during the years. There was a waiting list of approximately 400 when we had 4,000 in treatment, yet the waiting list is similar now with between 5,500 and 6,000 in treatment. As the Deputy and most people will be aware, the problem we have is that local communities have objected to treatment centres in certain areas. That is beginning to change, however, because people are beginning to see that there is a positive aspect to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is becoming very clear. I could cite many examples of this. I took part in a radio discussion recently in Crumlin when the chairman of the local residents association, who had objected strongly to the opening of a drug treatment centre, openly said that he had been wrong about the issue. He said that not alone had the centre not caused problems but it had improved the situation within the community. This morning, I was in another flat complex and the same thing applied &ndash; there were huge objections initially but now there is a drug treatment centre within it. People are being treated and there is complete acceptance from the local community which is very positive about it. We have to get local communities on board. As the Deputy is aware, if we try to ram through the introduction of drug treatment centres without agreement, the plan will backfire. If, however, we negotiate slowly with communities, they will see that there can be a positive outcome. We must get backing from everybody, including public representatives. Everyone who has done so is aware it is difficult to stand up and say one is in favour of a drug treatment centre but sometimes we have to show leadership and do it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the main reasons, believe me. If we could have all the treatment centres open by the end of the year, there would be no waiting lists. There are approximately 13,500 addicts, of whom a certain percentage do not want treatment. Others do, however, and if it is seen to be available, they will come forward. If they see their friends and others going into treatment and can see the advantages, they will come in. At a certain stage we will have enough treatment places when I hope the waiting list will come down a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about harm reduction. Obviously getting people into treatment is the easiest way of achieving it. That is what we are endeavouring to do but we want to make sure that it becomes more attractive for them to come into treatment. When they are there they should be looked at on a case by case basis and a holistic approach should be taken. They should know their rights and the way in which they should be treated. I am aware that there have been complaints that they are not treated very well. They get angry about this, especially those whom I have met. We are also negotiating with pharmacies to put in place a new needle exchange programme.  There is a problem with regard to drugs users under 18 years. We cannot provide medical treatment to such people without their parents' agreement. We are working on a new protocol for under 18 year olds that will attempt to satisfy the legal and ethical problems we may encounter <Col N="16" /> when dealing with that age group. We are all horrified at the number of people under 18 years presenting for treatment but at least they are doing so whereas a few years ago such people were taking heroin but had nowhere to go to access treatment. That is what the people working at the coal face say. The length of time these young people have been taking heroin before presenting for treatment is often much shorter than it was a few years ago. We are very much aware of the problem of under 18 year olds. Unfortunately, the medical professionals have a legal and ethical problem which we are trying to resolve.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to the interdepartmental group the detail of which is outlined on page 120 of the national drugs strategy, 2001-08. This seems to be a new body chaired by the Minister of State which reports to the Cabinet sub-committee so it appears it will decide what is prioritised to go before the sub-committee. There is no representative of the community and voluntary sector in the group. The Minister of State will agree that this sector has played a critical role in policy formulation and has, to a large degree, been the driving force behind much of the national strategy. Clearly it should be represented on the interdepartmental group. I ask the Minister of State to consider co-opting a representative of the community voluntary sector onto it.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the practice by some doctors in some treatment centres of imposing sanctions on drug users, for example, reducing the amount of methadone given to those who turn up late? This seems to be unethical. Does he disapprove of it and will he take action to ensure that it does not continue? Is it intended to integrate the national strategy on alcoholism with the national drugs strategy in light of the fact that there does not appear to be any structures in place to implement this policy which was developed five years ago and about which we have heard little or nothing?

The problem of under age drinking came very much to the fore during our nationwide consultations. It was obviously a serious one which people raised with us all the time. It is up to the local drug task forces to identify projects they want to fund, some of which will be for youth facilities. Outside of that, the young peoples' facilities and services fund, which has spent about £45 million, is one of the best things I have seen in the Department. It is simple and effective and goes straight to the heart of the matter. Local communities can apply for the money which can be given out. This excellent fund has contributed to over 300 projects and is something that should not only be continued but expanded.</P>

      <P>This morning I was at a project <Col N="18" /> where approximately ten young women and two young men are on the programme. I asked the question the Deputy has just asked and they all said it is without doubt that they would still be on heroin were it not for methadone. Two of them are off methadone and all want to get off it. At a centre I visited in Inchicore &ndash; in the Deputy's constituency &ndash; a number of people had come off it and had completed a City and Guilds computer course. Their last challenge was to get off methadone.</P>
      <P>There is much criticism of methadone but if one asks those participating in the programme, they are very positive about it. What we need to have is a range of options available to those who present for treatment, be it naltrexone, buprenorphine or methadone, or allow them to detoxify completely. The latter is a very difficult course and not very many who take it are successful. It is an option but we have said we are looking for, and are open to, successful international best practice. There is a general view that there will be a number of breakthroughs in the area of drug addiction and medication for drug addicts that will not necessarily be based on the methodology methadone treatment is. There is light at the end of the tunnel in the number of those getting into treatment and new developments in the medical field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department and other agencies have carried out investigations on a number of levels into the reports to which the Deputy refers. With regard to sheep imports from Northern Ireland, the position is that since November 1992 a bilateral arrangement had existed between this Department and the Northern Ireland authorities in respect of sheep going to and from Northern Ireland. Under the arrangement, sheep of Northern Ireland origin could move freely here and <i>vice versa</i>. In the absence until now of a tagging and movement control system for sheep in Ireland it was not generally possible to distinguish between sheep of Northern Ireland or Republic of Ireland origin. Sheep presented for slaughter were not required to be tagged or accompanied by any specific docu<Col N="20" /> mentation. Sheep imported from Great Britain and other member states should be accompanied by appropriate certification and their arrival should be notified in advance by the member state.</P>
      <P>From interviews with the staff of my Department who inspect sheep at meat plants, there was no evidence available to them to suggest that sheep were being illegally imported given that it was virtually impossible for Department personnel to effectively establish the origin of sheep presented for slaughter in the absence of a tagging and movement control system. That situation has now been rectified and in addition the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, dealer legislation greatly strengthens controls.</P>
      <P>The legal responsibility for checks on sheep presented for slaughter at meat plants rests with the owner or person in charge of the establishment. The owner or person in charge of the abattoir or slaughterhouse is required to ensure each animal to be slaughtered bears an identifying mark or number to enable the veterinary inspector to determine its origin. Department staff were asked to be vigilant in establishing the origin of sheep for slaughter but did not have the necessary identification systems available which apply, for example, in the case of cattle.</P>
      <P>There is no legal requirement for sheepmeat to be labelled to indicate the country of origin of the animals. The procedure in Ireland and other member states is that all carcasses which passed the required veterinary inspections are stamped with the official health mark regardless of the origin of the animals prior to slaughter.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>With regard to the question of acquiescence or agreement by meat plants to arrangements to deliver live imported sheep to their premises for subsequent delivery live to farms in the State, the position is that investigations into these activities and others relating to the importation of sheep into this country are ongoing. These investigations are being conducted by the Garda authorities and I understand there is the possibility of prosecution under a number of headings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister direct his attention to the part of the question he has not answered? Will he tell me the reason it was not possible for officials of his Department or factory management to simply inspect sheep on the basis that sheep coming from Northern Ireland, which would have carried tags when there, would have holes in their ears when arriving at factories here? Will the Minister indicate that it would have been perfectly within the competence of staff of his Department and the factories to raise questions about these sheep?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, has there been any follow-up investigation of the statement made in an affidavit sworn by a person involved in importing sheep into Ireland that he brought animals by arrangement to a meat factory in County Kildare where they were then redistributed live to farms else<Col N="21" /> where in the country? Will the Minister indicate whether he has made any investigation of who was involved in that practice, what kind of agreement there was with the factory and what action, if any, staff of his Department at that factory took in that case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, my Department, with other agencies, the Garda and the Revenue, are carrying out ongoing investigations. Regarding the latter part of my reply and the matter of acquiescence of staff with or agreement by meat plants to deliver live imports of sheep to their premises for subsequent delivery to farms in the State, the position is that investigations are ongoing. The Deputy raised that matter at a committee last week. These investigations are being conducted by the Garda, the lead agency in this regard, and there is a possibility of prosecution under a number of headings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What kind of urgency is attached to these investigations? The events which gave rise to my question took place just before 21 February this year and four months later, on 26 June, the Minister is telling me that investigations are ongoing. When will we see some results from them and some action taken against those who put the status of our livestock industry at risk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas, including Deputy Dukes and others, contributed to passing legislation which will be extremely helpful with this issue. Without individual identification of sheep, it was not practical to have a complete traceability system. However, that is now in place and tagging is a requirement for all sheep going into plants since 21 June. This was resisted for a number of years. I established a sheep meat forum to have these matters addressed as the island of Ireland was a trade free area for sheep, North and South, from 1992 to date.</P>
      <P>In relation to the progress of the investigations, as I said, the Garda is pursuing the investigations with all urgency. I more than anyone else want to see a successful conclusion. My information is that there will be prosecutions, which is what I want to see. I do not want to be in a position where there is a lack of traceability or accountability regarding the movement of susceptible animals, nor do I want that for anyone who succeeds me.</P>

      <P>The package of measures we agreed at the Council of Ministers last week provided for an increase of 150,000 tonnes in the intervention ceiling for 2001. In addition, I secured a commitment from the Commissioner that he would use the intervention mechanism to stabilise the market during the second half of the year. This arrangement will be of major benefit to Irish beef producers in that it will facilitate an orderly transition from market support through the purchase for destruction scheme to support through intervention purchasing, and at the same time remove a significant uncertainty in relation to market supports for the coming months. I am satisfied these intervention mechanisms will provide an effective support for the market and ensure reasonable returns to producers.</P>
      <P>Cattle prices will, of course, be determined primarily by developments on the market. There is strong demand at present for Irish beef in the European market, due to the number of cattle and sheep slaughtered in the United Kingdom as a result of foot and mouth disease and by the ongoing recovery in beef consumption on continental markets. This should continue for the remainder of the year. I have also recently announced the reopening of the Russian market.</P>
      <P>However, it is of major importance that all third markets which are currently closed because of BSE are reopened as soon as possible. I will use every possible option available to me to secure the reopening of these markets. Egypt is particularly important in view of the size of that market for Irish beef. I am devoting considerable attention to this market. Discussions have taken place at a technical level recently and further discussions are envisaged in the period ahead. I believe that through this process it will be possible to secure a reopening of the Egyptian market.</P>

Does he also agree this inequitable treatment of suckler producers across Europe &ndash; compared to the treatment of their dairy counterparts &ndash; can be gleaned from the fact that producers of Holstein bulls from the German dairy herd would generally not claim the beef premium which is linked to stocking density? They will obviously claim their subsidy on maize. Suckler producers &ndash; a specialist sector producing prime beef unlike beef in the dairy sector which is a by-product &ndash; are once again visited with a regime that is more geared for the protection of another sector at their expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that across the midlands and in Westmeath premium payments account for more than 100% of income? These payments contribute to defraying fixed and variable costs. Sales of stocks would not cover the <Col N="23" /> costs. Does the Minister agree that due to the changes in stocking density, the reduction will ensure mixed farmers of sucklers, sheep and tillage will move out of lowland sheep production altogether? Is that a possible scenario?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the Council of Ministers, and my main priority, was to secure a floor for support for the market going into the autumn. We were in a position where we sought &ndash; as we still seek &ndash; to have the Egyptian market reopened. Thankfully, consumption is increasing in Europe again. We were informed at a recent meeting that it is now about 8% down on this time last year. That is a considerable improvement.</P>
      <P>In some countries consumption had been down by as much as 80%, and 50% in others. It is down on average by 8% to 10%. We are benefiting from the difficulties experienced by the UK and the Netherlands and there is a good market for 20,000 head of finished animals each week in Europe. We still expect to have the Egyptian market reopened. I am increasingly confident. The chief veterinary officer in Cairo is to visit Ireland in about five weeks. That is the first time he has agreed to do that in some considerable time. Some 300,000 tonnes extra in intervention is extremely useful. I hope we will not have to use it, but at least it is a floor.</P>
      <P>On the down side of the negotiations, we had to give up 50,000 head of special beef premium rights but we have been below that figure for some time. This year we are down 12%, so we would not be using those rights in any case. There is a 15% replacement requirement for suckler cows, but that would be normal replacement. Stocking density has been reduced from two to 1.8 and there are a couple of years to do that. That is well within the competence of the ordinary Irish farmer. Cattle prices this week are relatively stable and there is a firm demand. That has been brought about by the confidence which is due to a reasonably favourable outcome to the Luxembourg meeting.</P>

      <P>Arrangements are in hand for the filling of the two vacancies that have arisen in the <Col N="24" /> Athlone laboratory. My Department is working closely with the Office of Public Works to ensure outstanding works are dealt with so that the laboratory can again provide a full range of services in the shortest possible time. Athlone is one of a number of regional veterinary laboratories; the others are in Sligo, Kilkenny, Limerick, Cork and in the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory at Abbotstown &ndash; Fingal County Council &ndash; and provide a service to farmers throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The services provided by the laboratories include examination of specimens, for example, blood samples, milk samples, faeces, etc., received by post using the appropriate discipline of biochemistry, microbiology, etc., and postmortem examination of carcasses of farm animals for cause of death, and badgers for evidence of TB. The laboratory at Athlone continues to provide all services except the post-mortem services.</P>
      <P>The Athlone laboratory was completely rebuilt in the past few years at a cost of £1.3 million and opened for operation last year. However, on opening a number of difficulties became apparent and the efforts of my Department and the Office of Public Works have since been directed towards overcoming these difficulties and having a detailed snag-list dealt with so that the laboratory can be again made fully functional. As regards staffing levels, two vacancies exist in the regional laboratory in Athlone, for a serological assistant and a laboratory attendant. It is proposed that the serological assistant vacancy will shortly be filled by way of voluntary transfer of a member of staff currently located at another of the Department's laboratories.</P>
      <P>The vacancy for laboratory attendant has arisen due to the continued absence of a laboratory attendant on sick leave since last August. As it may be some time before this officer can return to work, it is proposed to recruit a laboratory attendant as quickly as possible and accordingly arrangements have been made to advertise this vacancy.</P>

Will the Minister indicate why it is only now that action is being taken to recruit a laboratory assistant when the need for this post has been clear to everybody concerned for some time? Will the filling of the serological post by voluntary transfer from another laboratory not simply move the problem to that other laboratory?</P>

      <P>I expect the vacancies to be filled in the next couple of weeks. I am not sure of the background to the problem. It was raised by Deputy Penrose last week and has been brought to my attention. It is being sorted out as a matter of urgency. I have a list containing 77 snags. They are all small and detailed snags relating to the <Col N="25" /> building. I have asked the Office of Public Works to sort out the repairs as a matter of urgency. There was £1.3 million spent on this laboratory in the past two years and it is not good enough to have difficulties such as blocked gullies and overflowing sinks. There are some technical problems despite it being a new building, but these will be rectified in the next two weeks, as will the staffing issue.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to ensure that the restrictions in place which protected the country from an outbreak of foot and mouth disease should remain in place as a matter of routine to protect animal health and food safety; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19031/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive range of measures was introduced in recent months to prevent the possible spread of foot and mouth disease. These measures included strict biosecurity measures at ports and airports and on farms, the closure of livestock marts, prohibitions on the importation of produce and livestock from countries with foot and mouth cases, the placing of Garda checkpoints on Border crossings and a range of strict controls on the movement of animals within the country.</P>
      <P>It is not possible or necessary to keep all of these controls in place on a permanent basis. Some were introduced in the context of addressing the specific threat posed by foot and mouth disease and the retention of all of them would make the business of farming impossible, or tie up enormous State resources that are urgently required for services in other areas. I have, therefore, in recent weeks made a series of announcements relaxing various measures in a phased and controlled manner. Most significantly, I permitted the reopening of the marts on 18 June. All of these announcements were made on the basis of advice from the expert group. They were intended to allow the resumption, to some degree, of normal life in the agricultural sector while taking account of the residual FMD risk, particularly from Britain. I will continue to make such adjustments to the remaining controls as are necessary to allow the business of farming and, indeed, activities in other sectors to continue having regard to any remaining risk of spreading disease and based on the advice of the expert group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the import of the issues raised in the <Col N="27" /> Deputy's question. I will try to discover the extent to which there is a need to retain a number of the controls. Some of these are essential hygiene regulations. On better farms and in better areas where susceptible animals are gathered, such regulations should be obeyed as a matter of course. I hope that we do not return to a pre-foot and mouth situation in respect of some of the controls we have put in place. However, as already stated, I have allowed the relaxation of a number of controls in order to facilitate a return, in so far as is possible, to normality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department on their success in containing the outbreak of foot and mouth here. Some of the restrictions put in place such as the disposal of slurry and restrictions on the movement of animals proved extremely effective and could contribute significantly to improving animal health and food safety. Diseases such as TB, brucellosis and salmonellosis have economic implications, but they also have implications for human health and food safety. They have dogged this country for many years and vast amounts of money have been spent on trying to eradicate them, but we have failed in that regard. Foot and mouth is what I would term an &ldquo;economic&rdquo; disease and we have been able to contain it. If the same rigorous approach were taken to controlling and eliminating TB, brucellosis and salmonellosis, we could expect a more effective outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Upton that the response of people, and not just farmers, to the outbreak of foot and mouth was outstanding. I have already asked sections within my Department to provide up-to-date statistics on other diseases to see how they have been affected by the curtailment of animal movement. It will be interesting to see what emerges, particularly in respect of the diseases &ndash; TB, brucellosis and salmonella &ndash; to which the Deputy referred and in the context of food safety. Lessons should be learned from our experience with foot and mouth and I assure her that I will be carefully examining the range of control measures that remain in place. I will consider retaining a number of these if the Department's veterinary experts deems it necessary or advisable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government that every export market should be open to Irish beef and cattle and no effort is being spared by me, my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to bring this about. Each of our important export markets is being dealt with in whatever way is most appropriate to the circumstances prevailing in that market. The strategy to be adopted in each case is kept under constant review having regard to advice from our embassies and Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>Trade with the Lebanon has resumed and exports to that country recommenced on 13 June with a shipment of 1,296 cattle. With regard to the EU, while intra-Community restrictions on trade have been lifted, live exports have not yet recommenced. There are issues relating to the transport of animals through member states and to the specific guarantees required by importing veterinary authorities which remain to be resolved. Once overland transport of animals recommences, appropriate lairage facilities will be required in France involving the appropriate veterinary or animal welfare measures. The provision of such facilities in the past has not been a problem.</P>
      <P>With regard to beef, Egypt is our largest market and much of our effort in recovering export markets has been focused on Egypt. I, and a number of senior officials of my Department, travelled to Egypt last December and met the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also met President Mubarak in Cairo and discussed this matter with him. Further visits to Egypt were undertaken by officials of my Department this year and I also took the opportunity last month to raise the matter with a visiting Egyptian ministerial delegation. Arising from ongoing contacts between my Department and the Egyptian authorities, it has been agreed that a delegation of Egyptian veterinary officials, headed by the chief veterinary officer in Cairo, will travel to Ireland in early August. I remain hopeful that following that visit the market will reopen. Another important market is Saudi Arabia and a senior veterinary official of my Department travelled last January to Riyadh to brief the authorities there on our BSE controls.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>Senior officials of my Department are in Egypt and the Gulf region this week following up on earlier contacts with the relevant authorities there with a view to creating a framework for the re-opening of these markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Egyptian and Saudi authorities have a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. However, in many of our non-EU markets, of which Egypt is a good example, the situation has been exacerbated by adverse public opinion as a result of sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in par<Col N="29" /> ticular, on the BSE developments in those EU countries which encountered their first cases of BSE last year. Therefore, a return to normal trading and consumption patterns in the European Union will be a significant influence on these markets.</P>
    <P>I am naturally keen to renew our trade in beef with Iran and my Department has had ongoing contact with the Iranian authorities both directly and through diplomatic channels on the question of veterinary certification. Iranian approval of the veterinary certificate was received in April of last year and my Department has kept in contact with the Iranian authorities since then to ensure that Ireland is included in the list of countries invited to tender for supplies of beef to Iran.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to Russia is that the authorities there have lifted the total ban on Irish beef imposed following the single outbreak of FMD in Ireland last March. The earlier Russian restrictions on six named counties remains in place. My Department is now finalising details of the veterinary certificate required by the Russian authorities with a view to the early resumption of this trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any effort to reopen these markets. Does the Minister accept that the recent decisions taken in Europe will have a major effect on commercial livestock producers? Does he also accept that because he agreed to severe reductions in production rates and in premia full-time commercial farmers will be worst affected? Will the Minister outline the position with regard to Libya? It has been a number of years since he indicated that market would reopen in October, but unfortunately that never happened.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to indicate when live exports to Italy and Spain will proceed? These were much heralded and have been responsible for creating a strong trade in cattle at present. Will he indicate what the major intervention deal will mean in terms of the price farmers will obtain? It is good that there will be an additional 300,000 tonnes, but the price people will obtain is more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort is being made to reopen the Egyptian market and we are hopeful because the veterinary authorities have agreed to visit Ireland, which is a good indication. An Assistant Secretary from the Department is in Cairo and a deputy veterinary officer is in the Gulf states. The authorities there advised us that they want it done at a technical level, not a political one. The problem is one of media perception rather than there being an actual problem. They say that progress will be made at a technical level. I am prepared to go there any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with Spain is that the restrictions on transport and rest periods mean layerages must be used. There was foot and mouth at a layerage near Paris which resulted in cases in France. There were further outbreaks in the <Col N="30" /> Netherlands when cattle travelled there from France. We are negotiating with the French authorities to allow live exports of calves and weanlings to Spain and Italy through their country. That is not easy because some French cases of the disease were traced back to Ireland and Britain. We are doing what we can to speed that up. Both Spain and Italy agreed to take Irish exports but the problem is getting them there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will start the clock when I start my reply. My Department has arranged a training course for REPS planning agencies for the week beginning 2 July. Qualified applicants were advised of the dates and asked to confirm their attendance. My Department hoped to hold courses earlier this year for suitably qualified individuals who wished to establish themselves as REPS planning agencies under the new scheme. Provisional arrangements were made, but my Department had to cancel them in line with precautions against the possible spread of foot and mouth disease. A visit to a suitable farm for demonstration purposes is a central part of the course for all participants, and obviously this could not take place during the emergency. Previously I gave an undertaking that my Department would reschedule the courses as soon as it was practical and safe to do so, and I am glad that the successful containment of the disease has now made it possible.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that a date is set for this course. Will the Minister say why the provision of the course was deferred on at least two previous occasions before the outbreak of foot and mouth disease? Is he not aware that the course should have taken place last year, long before the outbreak of the disease?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy should know, the new REP scheme did not come into effect until 27 November 2000. Until then we did not know what was in the scheme and could not train people for a course that was not agreed. After that date, it was agreed to introduce the course but foot and mouth disease intervened. The course will take place on 2 July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot reply to all those questions in the given time. The comments on time saving are nonsense. There are provisions in the national development plan for a huge increase in the number of REPS applications. The foot and mouth disease held matters up this year. We are speeding up the process. I want as many as possible in the REP scheme. One hundred people applied for planning courses and 50 will be accommodated on this course. If all 100 take up the offer, another course will be speedily organised. Suitable applicants are people with a degree in agricultural science or environmental science. The training at the course includes all the measures under the REP scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minister, I was concerned about people missing dates. Everyone is prone to the odd oversight but there is the added complication that not only is the applicant involved but also the planner and it is easy for people to get confused between one and the other. Arrangements are being made to warn applicants when they are <Col N="33" /> over time that they are already on penalty time and if they do not get their application in within the specified time they are in danger of losing the total grant. We have to put mechanisms in place to reduce as far as possible the chance that someone would miss out on a REPS payment because a bit of paper did not arrive in time. I have had personal experience of this happening.</P>

      <Quest>the funding plan and time frame for the Leader+ and national rural development programme.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft Leader+ operational programme continues to be under examination by the EU Commission. The examination process has progressed through a number of Commission procedures and my Department is in negotiation with it with a view to finalising and securing approval of the programme. This is now anticipated within a short number of weeks. EU Commission approval of the Leader+ programme will also clear the way for start-up of the Leader national rural development programme.</P>
      <P>In parallel, the selection of local rural development groups to deliver new Leader activity is proceeding apace. Pending this, the interim funding arrangement to Leader groups without prejudice as to the appointment of groups will remain in place. I established the arrangement to help maintain core resources so as to sustain momentum and facilitate early evaluation and funding of projects under the new Leader programmes when commenced.</P>
      <P>There will be a total of £117 million in public funding available for Leader activity in Ireland in the period to 2006. An amount of £58 million is available under Leader+ with £38 million being provided by the EU and the balance being provided by the national Exchequer. Under the mainstream national Leader programme there is a total of £59 million available, with £25 million being provided by the EU and the balance coming from the national Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that the decision on group selection for the Leader+ and the national rural development programme was due in May or early June this year, as is the understanding of those who have been asking me about it? Does the Minister agree that the delay in making a decision on Leader+, in particular, has resulted in loss of momentum and damage to community initiatives? Will he take into consideration that community initiatives are stagnating in areas such as the one I represent in County Dublin as they wait for news of Leader+? Even with 72% of the total area of Dublin they contain just 7% of the population and some of the finest agricultural area in the country. Will the Minister recognise <Col N="34" /> the importance of making a quick decision on Leader+ to avoid any further stagnation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully recognise the importance of a speedy decision and it is for that reason that the Department is doing the selection while awaiting the final decision from the Commission in Brussels. This country is well ahead in this process compared to other countries. Most of them are waiting until the decision comes from Brussels before starting their selection process. We cannot move ahead of the final decision from Brussels. We are at the top of the list awaiting the decision. I am pushing forward the parallel process of selecting the various groups and we have just received a report from the consultant regarding an evaluation of the groups. It is a pity that one Leader programme does not run seamlessly into another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What queries has the Commission raised in regard to Ireland's application for Leader+? Have there been any delays arising from responses to queries? Will the Minister outline the criteria used by his Department in selecting groups? Are they multiple criteria or are they generally phrased? Does the Department intend to accept in full the consultant's recommendations as to selection or will there be a margin for discretion on the part of the Minister? </P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision will be a Cabinet and not a ministerial one. There has been an evaluation and a selection committee will be involved in making recommendations. In relation to criteria there are two programmes involved, Leader+ and Leader national. I am anxious that every part of the country will be covered by a group. We will look at the criteria laid down by Brussels, and innovation is one of the major areas of interest to Brussels. Obviously those that fit the Leader+ model will go into that scheme and that will leave the others under the national scheme. It is not a question of being put in a straitjacket if we want to cover the various parts of the country. Everybody would be anxious that either Leader+ or Leader national would be available to all parts of rural Ireland. We must look at this in a reasonable light and also look at the various applications to come to a reasoned decision. To do anything else would be to abrogate political responsibility and our duty to make sure that decisions made stand up reasonably.</P>

Their position may prejudice their ability to carry on if selected for either the national or EU programme. Will the Minister explain why, although the Department submitted its proposals to the Commission in November, six and a half months later there is still an argument going on about <Col N="35" /> additional information or criteria? Why is it so difficult to reach finality?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss rate quoted by the Deputy occurred in one particular season a number of years ago where Teagasc identified a specific quality control problem with one particular tag. The relevant information was passed on to the manufacturers who implemented quality control measures. The more usual loss rate experienced by Teagasc has been of the order of 3% to 5%. At my Department's request Teagasc has put in place a monitoring programme using a number of the NSIS approved tags. Loss rates to date under this programme are less than 1%. My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, will monitor this issue on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that farmers when they can get the tags, which not all of them can yet, are being advised that if they use a little washing-up liquid it makes it easier to change them? The scheme requires tags to be changed from time to time. Is the Minister aware that the lack of availability of these tags has resulted in the lamb kill being 30% down on what it would normally be during this period?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss rate is less than 1%. The tagging of sheep has been an unhappy saga for some time. There has been resistance from farmers and farm leaders. At any rate, in May 2001, farmers were issued data on the tagging programme, which specified a date of 21 June. It was 15 June before any farmer applied for a tag. That showed that farmers were not anxious to participate fully in the scheme. It is a pity that farm leaders have not encouraged members to do so.</P>

Having got the farming organisations to finally accept the scheme, will the Minister agree that it behoves him and them to ensure that they work together with suppliers so the market will not be adversely affected and lambs fit to sell will not have to be retained because of the nonavailability of tags? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that inconvenience and disruption are being caused, particularly to those farmers who have finished fat lambs. I have communicated with the accredited suppliers of the tags, who work throughout the weekend. My information is that 1.35 million tags have been given to farmers and <Col N="37" /> that the tags are being manufactured and made available at the rate of 165,000 per day. In our plants, we slaughter about 100,000 lambs per week so there should be an adequate number of tags. The problem is that farmers did not apply on time. Additionally, in an IFA press release on 18 June, it was stated that farmers should put the brakes on lamb supplies. Mr. Frank Corcoran, the chairman, said farmers should withhold supplies. That is not a good way of encouraging the supply of lambs to factories.</P>

Is he proud of the fact that many of those who were on the waiting list when the Government came to office four years ago are still on it? Is he proud of the Government's failure in relation to housing where we have, for the first time in the history of the State, young people who cannot afford to buy their own houses? Is he proud of its total failure in relation to traffic gridlock? Is he proud of the fact that five times as many Irish children leave primary school with learning difficulties as do in the republic of Finland, which has the same sort of population and wealth as Ireland?

It is appropriate that the Minister for Health and Children is sitting beside the Minister. Does he agree he has the good fortune to be a member of the first Government in the history of the State which is not constrained by resources? Having been taken to court regarding people's education rights, does he, and his colleagues, feel ashamed that a woman from Finglas who is seeking chemotherapy treatment which could possibly save her life is obliged to take the State &ndash; not just the Government &ndash; to court to try to get access to such treatment?

      <P>The issue regarding hospital treatment is a matter for the patient's consultant. There was a problem in recent days whereby chemotherapy treatment for a number of patients in the Mater Hospital was postponed. Needless to say, none of us wishes to see such things happen and I would be concerned by any interruption to the scheduled treatment of patients requiring chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. When the ERHA learned of the difficulties it took immediate steps to seek alternative accommodation for the patients concerned and is continuing to work closely with the hospital.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997, over £60 million has been invested in developing cancer services.

If he is not responsible for the administration of chemotherapy, let me ask him a question concerning health services for which he is responsible. Why, in last year's budget, did the Minister for Finance promise that medical cards would be available for the elderly from 1 July? Why are no application forms for those medical cards available? The Minister cannot blame this situation on the hospitals or anyone but the Government. What has gone wrong with the Government that it is so incompetent that all it seems to be able to do is waste money to no effect? Why is a measure which was repeatedly promised and trumpeted not going to happen? Is the Government so incompetent that it cannot make something of a measure over which it has total control? This measure was promised, and repeated, in last year's budget?</P>

As regards the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, the Minister may be aware that this afternoon the Oireachtas joint committee on justice requested that the Bill not be processed further before the recess to allow it to hear oral submissions. The committee requested that the Government urgently introduce a Bill comprising section 7 of the existing Bill to allow for the establishment of the human rights commission and to broaden the number of members of the commission. Does the Government intend to take such a course of action? Is it intended to make time available for a detailed debate on the Garda Síochana Complaints Board's annual report for 1999? Will the Minister explain why, when the Government received the report in December 2000, it delayed for six months before publishing it or laying it before both Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>

There is now a cross-party consensus in the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that this should be done, and the committee heard compelling evidence about the matter today. Will the Minister reflect on this issue before the committee meets again tomorrow <Col N="50" /> afternoon, so that we will not divide on a party political basis upon an issue of human rights?

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on the 30th day of June, 2001.</P>
      <P>The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2001.</P>
      <P>Members will need no reminding of the circumstances in which these provisions were enacted in 1998. The Omagh bomb, in August of that year, was the single worst atrocity in the conflict in the North of Ireland. It gave rise to universal revulsion and also to a determination &ndash; nowhere more so than in this House &ndash; that those responsible for this mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people on this island that the conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One person is currently before the courts on a charge related to the Omagh bomb, and the investigation is continuing with excellent co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the RUC. The Garda Síochána will never give up the search for those responsible. The intention of the Oireachtas in enacting the 1998 Act was to strengthen as far as legitimately possible the provisions of the offences against the State Acts that deal with subversives to enhance the capacity of the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system to deter and detect those who would seek to subvert the democratic order and impose their undemocratic will on the people of this island through violence. In recognition of the particular circumstances surrounding the enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas to see if the circumstances then prevailing justified the continuance in force of its provisions, or whether there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that the provisions were no longer needed. Under section 18 of the Act, therefore, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, and by virtue of resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas on 20 June 2000, sections 2 to 12, inclusive, and 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2001 unless a further resolution is passed by each <Col N="55" /> House authorising the sections to continue to operate for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
    <P>Also included in the Act was a requirement on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. I laid such a report before this House on 21 June. I will go into more detail on the information contained in the report shortly, but its conclusion is that the renewal of the provisions for a further year is necessary. The sad reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bomb have, in the past year, continued their campaign of violence and there is no change of substance to the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the individual sections which this House is asked to continue in force for a further 12 months. I will outline their purpose and indicate where they have been utilised in the past 12 months. Section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation, evidence is given that the accused when questioned failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. As mentioned in my report which is before this House, this provision has been utilised on many occasions in questioning persons arrested on suspicion of being members of an unlawful organisation. Charges do not of course result in every case in which the provision is used, but during the period of the report, in other words over the past year, charges were preferred in five significant cases in which section 2 was utilised. One of these cases resulted in a conviction, while the other four cases are currently before the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act provides that in proceedings for an offence of membership of an unlawful organisation the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of such an organisation shall be evidence that he or she was then such a member. It originally defined the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 of the 1998 Act was to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; to include movements, actions, activities or associations. This simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act <Col N="56" /> with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts and any offence arising from the same set of facts as such an offence, provided the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged, but did not do so. This section, as with section 2, incorporated important safeguards whereby it will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure to mention such a fact might be, and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
    <P>Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939. One person is currently before the courts charged with such an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 7 made it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.</P>
    <P>Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Two persons are currently before the courts on charges under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, which otherwise is 48 hours, to 72 hours on the authorisation of a District Court judge. The judge must be satisfied, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf. In the past year 27 persons have had their periods of detention extended under this provision and nine of these <Col N="57" /> were subsequently charged with offences. Two of these persons have been convicted and the remaining cases are before the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the rearrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can be authorised only in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which it wishes to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Six persons were convicted during the past year with offences under this section.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, providing for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever a person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</P>
    <P>This information on the use made of these provisions of the 1998 Act over the past year is based on information received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid by me before this House. When contrasted with the previous report, it shows that more and more the key provisions of the Act are taking effect. I have always made the point that it would take time for the Act to take effect. Some provisions of the Act, such as extended detention, of their nature have an immediate impact. Others, however, such as the new offences created by the Act where time is needed to build a case for prosecution or the provisions for the drawing of adverse inferences which take effect only when a case comes to court, were always going to take time to have effect. We are now seeing the results coming through, with the section 2 provision for adverse inferences used in five cases resulting in one conviction and four pending charges, one person charged under section 6 with directing the <Col N="58" /> activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made, two persons charged under section 8 in relation to information likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation and six persons convicted under section 12 of instructing or training another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister's full statement will be on the Dáil record. In fairness to him, it contains relevant and important information.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the motion before the House and the continued enforcement of this legislation. One of the ultimate objectives of any democratic society must be to preserve democracy and ensure those who express their views through the ballot box have those views respected and supported. It causes sadness to Members of the House that this legislation is still necessary. It was the hope of many that the Good Friday Agreement would put into the annals of history the days of the bomb and the bullet and people believing in resorting to violence to achieve some worthy political objective. It is regrettable that there are still subversive groups unwilling to recognise the democratic acceptance of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement by the people of the whole island. These subversive groups are willing to maim, injure and kill to achieve their perceived political objectives. As the Minister stated, this legislation arose from the tragedy at Omagh. It is welcome that there is one person before the courts but many of us, on all sides of the House, would like that to be the case for all those responsible for that dreadful tragedy, the deaths that occurred and the blighting of many lives through serious injury. They should be brought before the courts promptly, tried and convicted for the enormity of the offence of which they are guilty. It is regrettable the security forces, the Garda and the RUC have not succeeded in bringing more of those responsible before the courts. It is particularly ironic that the day we debate this legislation coincides with the discovery in the last 24 hours of yet another bomb, this time in Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join the Minister in congratulating the Garda and our Defence Forces on the central role they play in protecting all of us on this island, particularly those who live in this State, from the men of violence. I congratulate them, too, on the steps they take to bring an end to violence in Northern Ireland and curtail the activities of those who refuse to recognise the great wish for peace throughout the island. The Garda should be congratulated for finding the bomb in Monaghan yesterday as should the Army bomb disposal unit, members of which regularly place their lives at risk to the benefit of all in this community. It dealt with that bomb today and ensured it did not pose a danger to anyone. It is the earnest hope of the Fine Gael Party that we reach the stage where legislation of this nature will not be necessary. I <Col N="59" /> hope by June next year it will not be necessary for a similar motion to be brought before the House by the Government of the day. I am not optimistic that will be the case. There are small groups on this island which are deaf to discussion and dialogue. They believe they have a God-given right to take life, maim, injure, destroy and do everything possible to undermine the peace process and distort normal politics and democratic interaction on the island.</P>
    <P>Having this legislation before us yet again serves a useful function. It allows all of us committed to democratic politics to make clear that we will not allow the continued subversion of democracy by the men of violence. It is deeply regrettable after so many years, deaths and atrocities, that we need to return to this debate annually. I conclude on behalf of Fine Gael by congratulating the Garda and the Defence Forces on the work they do and expressing full support for the continued employment of this legislation. On this we are at one with the Minister and the Government. I repeat the hope by this time next year we will be in a new environment, in which the need to renew this motion will not arise, and can celebrate the fact that finally the small group of subversives who have chosen to ignore the democratic will of all the people of this island will have a change of mind and approach, but I am not optimistic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by remembering the reason the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was passed. It was in the immediate aftermath of the horrible bombing of Omagh where almost 30 people died, scores were savagely maimed and the town was devastated. The pain of all involved is as real today as it was in 1998. The Irish people collectively were outraged to an extent I have never witnessed and there was a determination not yield to such savagery, particularly as it came within months of the vote on and signing of the Good Friday Agreement. The strong view put to the House and in the public media was that those responsible for the heinous crime could be identified, but the legislation then in place was not sufficient to ensure they would be brought to account. The belief was that the amending legislation contained in the 1998 Act would have that effect and it is a cause of dismay that there has not been substantial progress in bringing to account those responsible for that vicious and evil crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, in seeking to reconfirm this Act, we went through its individual sections in some detail. Reading the report provided for us under the Act, it seems that there has been greater use of its provisions in the last six months than in the previous 12. I welcome that in so far as it strikes at that small group which is deaf to the will of the Irish people, North and South, the yearning of people everywhere for peace and the democratic right of people to have their endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement recognised. Nobody has <Col N="60" /> the right to pull that asunder and they certainly do not have the right to pull it asunder by vicious and violent means. I am fearful that this small group of individuals has grown since this particular measure was enacted. From media reports of late, it seems, not only is their numerical strength greater but so also is their financial base. It behoves us all to give the Garda whatever it needs to ensure it can protect democracy and the rule of law in this State. For that reason the Labour Party will support the proposals to extend the provisions of this Act for a further year, again hoping it will be the last year they will be required. We do not know. It is a difficult and fraught time for the peace process, which is not an issue that divides the House; we wish the key players in the process success in the weeks to come.</P>
    <P>The larger issue here is the review of the offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998, which was promised in the Good Friday Agreement. In a reply to a recent parliamentary question the Minister said the committee chaired by the former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Anthony Hederman, recently submitted an interim report to him. I understand the final report is to be available before year's end. Will the Minister indicate if he will submit the interim report to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights so that we can have sight of it or will he at least provide it to Opposition spokespersons? Will he indicate now his preliminary views regarding his response to that interim report so we can know how this matter is to be progressed?</P>
    <P>Since last year a number of other issues have also arisen. One was the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights that provisions of the offences against the State Acts under which detained persons can be charged with failure to account for their movements is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. That relates to the Heaney and McGuinness <i>v</i> Ireland case and the Quinn f2&gt;v Ireland case. It is important that the State is seen to support and defend the European convention strongly and effectively. In a few days we will be dealing with the transposition of that convention into our domestic law and the mechanism by which that might best be done, and we must be mindful of the rulings of the Court of Human Rights in matters which affect Irish law.</P>
    <P>Also, since our debate this time last year the United Nations human rights committee found Ireland in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the grounds of not showing reasonable and objective grounds for depriving a person of the right to a jury court. The UN committee stated that in future this State should not try people before the Special Criminal Court unless it could show reasonable and objective criteria for so doing. What is the Minister's response to that? Will the DPP in future give an explanation that meets the criteria laid down by the UN human rights committee, that is, grounds <Col N="61" /> that are reasonable and objective for referring a case to the Special Criminal Court? We have obligations under the convention and I understand we are obliged to respond to that finding within 90 days. Since that 90 day period is still ticking away, the Minister might indicate what the Government's response to that finding will be.</P>
    <P>While we support provisions that are required to protect our democracy, they must always be tempered. An interesting article, &ldquo;Constitutional Aspects of Non-Jury Courts&rdquo;, written by Peter Charleton SC and Paul Anthony McDermott BL was published in the <i>Bar Review</i> in November 2000. It states:</P>
    <P>The fact that special powers can be justified does not mean that one should not be vigilant in assessing their impact . . . As a minimum it may be suggested that special laws should meet the following principles:</P>
    <P>i) they should operate only in so far as is absolutely necessary;</P>
    <P>ii) they should delegate as little as possible from the ordinary criminal law;</P>
    <P>iii) they should be as clear as possible;</P>
    <P>iv) they should be kept distinct from ordinary powers and should only be used against those for whom such laws are made necessary. The temptation to use special powers against other criminals should be resisted;</P>
    <P>v) they should be reviewed at regular periods and should be repealed as soon as the conditions justifying their existence have ceased to exist: in other words &lsquo;no emergency, no emergency law.'</P>
    <P>States can fall into the habit of maintaining oppressive, emergency or draconian laws on the Statute Book because it sometimes facilitates the prosecution of ordinary crime. The House would not agree that should be the case and I, like many Members, look forward to a time in this State and on this island when all emergency laws and special powers will disappear entirely from the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I oppose the renewal of these sections. It was accepted in 1998 that the measures put forward by the Government at the time were exceptional and draconian in the extreme and all involved professed that they did so with great reluctance. Now, three years later, it is becoming routine to renew these draconian provisions and, like previous offences against the State legislation and amendments to such Acts, these can become part of the permanent law of the land. That is wrong and I oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Omagh atrocity was held in the strongest revulsion by virtually every resident of this island bar perhaps a few dozen that were involved in whatever group carried it out. It is said that this legislation is to deal with that group. However, laws put through the Dáil do not apply to one or <Col N="62" /> two dozen people, awful as they might be; the law becomes the law of the land and is applicable to all citizens. It can be used on occasion in a situation that is quite different from that which caused the law to be introduced. By any standards the provisions the Minister is proposing to renew today are extremely repressive. The right to silence is attacked, even though that is traditionally seen as an important right regarding no inferences being drawn, particularly for the vulnerable. These provisions are so wide-ranging as to provide a possible catch-all set of circumstances to take care of virtually every situation. It is incredible to propose that the omission of a denial to published reports that one belongs to a proscribed organisation can be regarded, in large part, as proof of a crime and that with that and on the word of a senior Garda a person can be convicted. Provisions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 are also catch-all provisions. There is the possibility that an article one might have in one's possession could be used for a crime. The same goes for the collection of information or if a person has information which might have prevented a crime. The powers are so loose and broad that they are capable of being abused in particular circumstances. The State has already got widespread powers. They are sometimes over-weening powers on this particular question. The Offences against the State Act, 1939, is quite draconian.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Ms Sarah Condon on the Order of Business, that she was carted off to Limerick Prison today for taking part in a peaceful protest against refuse charges. That peaceful protest involved a charge under the Litter Pollution Act, 1996. Under the Offences against the State Act, 1939, peaceful citizens who have an objection to, for instance, a local tax and who might advocate peaceful civil disobedience to it to pressurise a Government can be charged and convicted of a serious crime. It is false to give the impression that this is just to deal with a few dozen unreconstructed people using individual terror and completely out of sympathy with the view of the vast majority in the State.</P>
    <P>The problem is that draconian legislation can be abused, when it suits the State, in circumstances other than those which caused it to be brought forward. I saw evidence of such an abuse of law in the last two weeks by a member state of the European Union. Sweden is regarded by many as a civilised state. I was in Gothenburg for the summit of EU leaders from 14-16 June, and a participant in peaceful protests against the policies of the European Union, the armaments industry, etc. I saw the Swedish police invoke their powers in an arbitrary way and use them against peaceful protesters, not against those throwing rocks or breaking shop windows. It was police provocation that caused that maniacal response by a tiny section of the protesters.</P>
    <P>The police used arbitrary powers of detention, held protesters for six hours, and photographed and identified them as a tactic against the right of peaceful protest. In the dead of night, they <Col N="63" /> invoked a power to revoke free travel between Sweden and other countries of the European Union. Two buses travelling from Germany &ndash; including socialist movement colleagues &ndash; to participate in a protest that involved 20,000 people, were detained by armed police on the outskirts of Gothenburg and forced to go to a military detention camp. They were detained there all day and only allowed to leave the buses in threes to take fresh air. Under heavily armed police escort, they were forced back to the border and deported that night.</P>
    <P>These were people travelling to make a peaceful protest, but legislation on the books was used in outrageous fashion to cut across a growing movement of opposition to certain policies of the European Union. I am not prepared to give any state powers that can be used and abused in this fashion. There is no question that the huge majority of our people are in total opposition to the activities of such paramilitary organisations which still exist or are still active. The State already has powers to deal with these groups and has used them. There are more powers than have yet been used by the State.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to any strengthening of repressive legislation. What brought those who planted the horrific Omagh bomb to heel was not the legislation brought forward in 1998, but the mass revulsion and mass mobilisation of citizens of this island against that barbaric action. It is the building of a movement, to break with the sterile sectarian politics that dominates the northern section of this island and provide a real alternative, that will cast to the sidelines those who believe they can carry out acts, said to be in the name of the Irish people, but in fact only in the name of a tiny minority.</P>

      <P>It is with great sadness that I rise to speak on this motion, sadness because it is necessary to have provisions of the Act extended. The Garda authorities have indicated that in view of the current security threat assessment, and the significant threat posed by dissident republican groups, it is necessary that the relevant sections of the Act remain in force. The Minister has advised the House that is the case.</P>
      <P>It is dangerous to equate what is happening in this country to what is happening in protests in other countries. As one involved in farm protests for many years, I protested all over Europe. Those protests were peaceful. They did not aim to cause damage to property, but to make a point about the economic situation of farmers in Europe at the time. That type of protest is important. We are dealing with a situation where evil people are putting together bombs and using other methods in an attempt to damage the limited peace on this island, and damage lives and property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Garda and the Army for their excellent operation in recent days in the Clones area, the area I represent not only as a Deputy <Col N="64" /> but as a councillor. The Garda and the Defence Forces need our full support and we must do all we can to provide it. In the townland of Clonoula near Clones in County Monaghan, the Garda and the Army disposed of a bomb of 60 kg of home-made explosives in a creamery can, ready for transportation to an unknown destination. It is no coincidence that it was found within a short distance of a local Church of Ireland hall damaged in an arson attack last year and which had only reopened, in the presence of Oireachtas Members, a few weeks ago. The bomb was placed only 500 metres from the main Galway-Belfast road. It could have been used in Northern Ireland, but could also have done serious damage to passers-by if it had gone off prematurely. Families had to be evacuated while it was being dealt with. Anyone who suggests we have rid ourselves of the problems which existed in 1998 when this Act was introduced is living in cloud cuckooland. We must ensure the Garda Síochána and the Army have at their disposal the necessary powers to allow them to prevent the occurrence of atrocities.</P>
    <P>Doohat Orange hall, which is situated close to my home, was damaged in recent weeks and that damage was not accidental. However, like the Minister, I wish to remind the House about the greatest atrocity of all, namely, the Omagh bombing. In August 1998, 29 lives were lost and two unborn infants were taken from this world. Many others were maimed. I recently spoke to the husband of one of the girls who was seriously maimed by the Omagh bomb and he informed me that, almost three years later, she is still undergoing surgery and continues to suffer from various side-effects. The families of the many victims of Omagh are still waiting for the people who carried out this atrocity to be brought to justice. I accept that the Garda, the Army and the authorities north of the Border have done everything possible. I have no doubt, however, that there are those in different organisations who know exactly who was responsible for the bombing. Even at this late stage and for the sake of our island home, it is important that they should come forward with the information they possess in order that those who carried out this atrocity are brought to justice as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the importance of the Good Friday Agreement. When it was signed, everyone hoped no further atrocities would occur and that the war was over. I perused the Agreement in recent days and discovered that the majority of the issues with which it deals have been dealt with, if not in full, to a large degree. For example, the prisoners have all been released. Thankfully, however, some of them have been taken back into custody and, in my opinion, that should be done when and where it is necessary. The Good Friday Agreement also contains a section dealing with decommissioning. Today we heard about the use of explosive material in a bomb found near the Border. It is <Col N="65" /> obvious that there is a need for decommissioning because we need to be certain that the war is over.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin made a commitment in respect of this matter. When it made that commitment, it stated it would do everything possible to persuade others to deal with the issue of decommissioning at the earliest opportunity. In recent months, Martin McGuinness, under oath, admitted that he was a senior member of the IRA. We no longer have to depend on Sinn Féin to order the commencement of or discuss decommissioning because a Sinn Féin MP and, I am sure, others who are closely involved with him in debates and discussions are members of a single organisation. Decommissioning was to have commenced a year ago and it was to have been concluded by now. At this late stage I call on those to whom I refer to show their commitment to the Agreement. They should not continue to ask others to honour the promises they made in that Agreement; they should make a commitment to deal with one of the issues with which they can deal.</P>
    <P>I had no difficulty with decommissioning and recognised that it needed to be done at the initial stage. I did, however, have difficulty with the release of some prisoners, particularly in light of the atrocities some of them were responsible for carrying out. It is no longer acceptable for members of Sinn Féin or Protestant hardline elements to claim that more time is required. They have had their opportunity, they know what must be done. The only way to ensure we will not need to approve the continuance of this legislation's provisions next year is to impress on those concerned that decommissioning should and must take place.</P>
    <P>The peace agreement is too precious to be allowed to disappear down the drain. We know that more than 3,000 people died as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland. However, we will never be able to estimate the number of people who were maimed or the number of lives that were shortened as a result of the atrocities that occurred. None of us want to see such atrocities happen again. I congratulate the Garda and the Army on the way they dealt with what might to some seem like a relatively small bomb discovered outside Clones. I remind the House that the device in question would have been more than sufficient to kill or maim many people. The fact that there are people who want to continue along the path of violence means we must retain whatever legislation is necessary to ensure the hands of the Garda Síochána are not tied and that they can deal with the sort of persons who obviously want to terrorise our island home and prevent peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a function with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle at which people from both sides of the religious divide sat down, ate a meal together and enjoyed an evening's entertainment. That is what we want to see happen across this island home of ours.</P>

      <P>As regards the finding of the UN human rights committee on the referral of cases to the Special Criminal Court, we are still within the 90 days given to the Government in respect of the finding. The interim report of the Hederman committee will assist the Government in deciding what should be the appropriate response. I have no doubt the committee reviewing the offences against the State Acts, which is chaired Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, will take into account Ireland's human rights obligations, whether under the European Convention on Human Rights or otherwise, in making its recommendations.</P>
      <P>While this legislation is draconian in many respects, it is necessary. It should be noted that the number of persons held under the extended detention provisions in section 10 over the past year was 27. That is a relatively modest number and, taken together with the other information I provided, supports my view that the provisions of the Act are reasoned and proportionate and are being implemented by the Garda Síochána in a measured and restrained manner. Some provisions have not yet taken effect in the context of court proceedings, but the Garda authorities have informed me that the provisions in question have been utilised, where appropriate, during the investigation of offences. Members will appreciate that many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has enjoyed considerable success in the past year in combating those who would subvert, through the use of violence, the democratic wishes of the people on this island. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating the force on its achievements. As Members are aware, the Garda Síochána, together with the Army, successfully prevented a bomb attack along the Border. The threat to life and to our democratic values which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act remains, however, as yesterday's incident clearly shows. So also, I am sure, does the determination of this House never to give in to such a threat, but to provide the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system with all legitimate means of combating it. The 1998 Act is an important part of that and is proving its worth. I am grateful to the House for agreeing to continue it in force. As well as security concerns which alone would justify the continuance of the pro<Col N="67" /> visions, another reason is it would be ridiculous to abandon it in advance of the forthcoming review by Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman's group. There are those who threaten to subvert the peace process through violence. The 1998 Act is a democratic response to that threat.</P>
    <P>I understand why Deputy Higgins feels that the legislation is draconian but he should acknowledge why it is necessary in present circumstances. He alleges that the Offences against the State Acts go overboard and need reform. I will receive the review committee's report on the Acts which will provide the basis for the House to discuss comprehensively all the issues involved. I am grateful to the House for supporting the provisions. Significant progress has been made on the path to peace but there are still those prepared to use violence to achieve their aims, as we saw with yesterday's threatened bomb attack. That real threat in a democracy must be responded to. The nature of the threat is the same since the House approved the enactment of the legislation and the continuation of it last year. That is the reality no matter how much we wish otherwise. The report on the Act's operation in the last year shows that it was sparingly, but increasingly effectively, used. I always said that it would take time for the results to come through, but, as I stated in my contribution, they are now doing so. The Act is effective and is as necessary now as when it was enacted.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Higgins's trip to Gothenburg, everyone supports the right to peaceful protest. Deputy Higgins and some of his socialist colleagues profess themselves to be Trotskyites. It was Trotsky who said, &ldquo;The party right, the party wrong and the party right and wrong.&rdquo;  I would not dispense advice to the Deputy, but it was shortly after that they put an ice-pick into his head down Mexico way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke before the adjournment of the debate on Friday, I said I regretted that this legislation did not tighten the anti-personation measures in view of the increased activity in this jurisdiction of people who, north of the Border, frequently abuse the democratic system. I specifically referred to the threat coming from a disciplined organisation. One of its members gave the game away during the election in West Tyrone when he said that it was carried <Col N="68" /> out with military precision. The word &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; has different meanings for that organisation. I urge strongly that something be done to improve identification measures at polling stations. The current list of identification documents is not good enough as, north of the Border and possibly in this jurisdiction also, there is an organisation that is good at forging these documents, as court cases established. Identification should include a photograph.</P>
      <P>There is a case to be made for an identity card though many across the spectrum object to this. I no longer share that reservation. There is a strong argument for a photographic identity card to protect the democratic process. People who object would do so even more strongly if they discovered that their votes were cast by someone else in a way of which they disapproved. The right of objection should not be confined to personation officers. The presiding officer, clerks and gardaí present should also have that right if they have good reason to believe that a person is not the person named on the register.</P>
      <P>There is no provision to extend postal voting and I welcome that. I am sorry to say that because this system is convenient for the elderly, those working away from home, students and others. I hope that, in future, for convenience's sake and to increase the number voting, the system will be extended. My reservations are based on my experience of how postal voting was fiddled and abused in the North. Applications and medical documents were forged. Intimidation was practised, especially on the elderly. They were threatened in their homes to get their postal votes. Postmen were followed and similarly intimidated.</P>
      <P>Some examples of personation caused laughter. I know of some light-hearted, humorous occurrences such as the application on behalf of a 89 year old so-called student claiming to be studying archaeology and history, and there are other examples. However, when it is done systematically by those with contempt for democracy it must be stamped out. It is indicative of a situation in some areas of Northern Ireland where from the electoral cradle to the electoral grave, and on occasions beyond the grave, sections of a certain political party organised people's vote. That is total abuse of democracy and something we should ensure will not happen here. We should make provision to ensure it does not because that day is coming fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of opinion polls, I am not in favour of them being published in the week leading up to an election. An opinion poll is coming out tomorrow on the by-election in Tipperary South and I do not fear the result but in a presidential election where there are only two or three candidates or in a by-election, such as the one this week where there are four candidates, opinion polls should not be published in the preceding week. It is a different matter if it concerns all 41 national constituencies. The result of an opinion poll can dictate and push matters in a particular direction in terms of strategic voting. That should <Col N="69" /> not be allowed to happen in the week before an election.</P>
    <P>A person who reaches the age of 18 years on or before polling day is eligible for entry on the supplement. I welcome this. It does not mean that the actual date of birth appears on the electoral register as in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland where the person concerned is entitled to vote on that day or on any election day after that date. Did the Minister consider this and, if so, why did he decide against it? I welcome section 28 which provides that ballot boxes with 50 ballot papers or less should be opened in view of the public. Why is it restricted to 50 rather than 100? </P>
    <P>A central part and essential element of this legislation is limitation of expenditure and enforcement of those limitations. There is no point in receiving big donations if the money cannot be spent. That limitation on expenditure is the essential element of the legislation and I regret the Minister has seen fit to increase the limits. Much expenditure in elections is unnecessary and often a result of panic decisions reacting to other candidates, including candidates of one's own party. A new run of posters at the last minute is one such unnecessary expenditure. This essential limit on expenditure should curtail such waste.</P>
    <P>The placing of candidates' names in alphabetical order on the ballot sheet is an advantage to those high on the alphabet. That is not referred to but perhaps it should be as it is a fact that research has proved correct. My name begins with C and in all the elections I have fought over a period of almost 40 years I have never been top of the ballot paper, even in a situation where there were only two names on it. It gives people an advantage to be top of the ballot paper. Perhaps we should consider some form of rota to ensure the advantage is spread around.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters I would like to raise but there is not enough time. I am totally in favour of the limitation of election expenses. I regret that the expenditure limits have been increased and wonder if the consequences of exceeding them have been sufficiently spelt out and are sufficiently strong. Where someone or some party has clearly exceeded election expenditure limits a fine is not enough. In those circumstances the ultimate sanction &ndash; the loss of the seat &ndash; should be the major deterrent to those who abuse the regulations.</P>

      <P>The Electoral (Amendment Bill), 2000, comes, like much legislation introduced recently, against a background of severe attacks on the integrity of politics and politicians. Unfor<Col N="70" /> tunately, the perception is abroad that the wrongdoing of the relatively small number caught reflects on the entire body politic. Effectively there appears to be the perception that &ldquo;they are all at it&rdquo;. That does an enormous disservice to hardworking people of integrity in all parties. It is the background against which electoral and ethics legislation of various kinds need to be considered and measured. There are some innovative proposals in this Bill and quite a deal of revising and upgrading of existing legislation.</P>
      <P>Many seem to believe that the principal reason for the drop in participation in the electoral process is due to the fact that there has been such bad publicity surrounding a relatively small number of politicians. That may well be the case. The turnout for the referendum on the Treaty of Nice was particularly disappointing. Perhaps more than any other occasion it illustrates the value of the vote exercised by the small number who chose to exercise it. The belief is that if there had been a much larger turnout, there would probably have been a different result. There are perhaps people who regret not having been part of what some see as an historic decision because of the success of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign or what others see as a disaster because of the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign. One of the issues that has dogged the electoral system is that more and more people appear to be opting out.</P>
      <P>The Minister is introducing a number of innovations, which I welcome. I know little about electronic voting and what we have seen from the US experience, in so far as it is electronic, would not encourage us in that regard. It is certainly an innovative departure and it will be interesting to see how it works. The issue of emblems and the provision of a photograph are matters which will be of considerable assistance.</P>
      <P>Since the postal vote has been more widely introduced it has made it possible for a great many more to participate in the process. As Deputy Currie said, it does carry with it the difficulty and the danger that it may be open to misuse. That appears to have happened in other jurisdictions to a far greater extent than it has here. I would welcome an extension, in relation to certain categories, of postal voting under this legislation, although I understand the reason the Minister did not proceed with it. Ultimately, any electoral legislation must have as its central tenet the integrity and security of both registration and voting. Deputy Currie mentioned the allegations concerning certain polling stations in Northern Ireland. We have heard these allegations for years and, particularly, we heard of the intimidation of voters after the recent general election. That is something which, thankfully, we have not seen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McDowell, if the House agrees. This is an important debate, given added impetus by the result of the referendum on the Nice treaty. It is a debate that should have taken place regardless of that referendum. The Government's response to the result of the referendum has been confused and divided, and in some cases opportunist and cynical. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Government is led not by the Taoiseach but by the coterie around the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste and that these people hold the Taoiseach in contempt. Such people believe in the philosophy of big business and small government, they embody establishment and powerful interests in this country and they see a social Europe as a threat to their interests.</P>
      <P>Having failed to lead a campaign, the Government is abrogating its responsibility to deal with the issues raised. It belatedly accepted the need for a forum on Europe as advocated by the Labour Party and this evening, again at my party's prompting, it can go a great deal further to resolving the issues that distance the European Union and the State from citizens. In our policy document on the Nice treaty, Good for Them, Good for Us, the Labour Party highlighted the issue of the democratic accountability of the European Union. As committed Europeans, we have believed for a number of years that there should be a debate on this country's role and relationship with the European Union. Having campaigned against the terms of entry into the EEC in 1973, the Labour Party is now the greatest advocate of an accountable and socially progressive European Union.</P>
      <P>Until the outcome of the Nice referendum, the Irish people were perceived as among the most committed to the European project and I do not believe that has changed. We had an incentive to be pro-European in previous years when we received large amounts of financial aid via the cohesion and structural funds programmes and the Common Agricultural Policy, funding that helped to transform the country. I say &ldquo;helped&rdquo; because Europe was not the only factor involved in the transformation. We have much to be proud of, but it would be delusory not to recognise the extent to which Europe has assisted. In many ways the contribution of the EU went beyond mere pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Economic growth has brought to an end the era in which we received European transfers. Whether enlargement happens or not, Ireland's days as a recipient of EU largesse are numbered, which is something we should celebrate as it is a testament to how far we have come since 1973. The end of the era has also broken the financial link that bound us to the European Union in the <Col N="72" /> minds of many, so it is right that we reassess our role within the EU. The Labour Party proposed the forum on Europe that has now become the National Forum for Europe. One of the key issues in the deliberations of the forum will be the relationship between European institutions and our national institutions. This is a new debate for Europe and it will dominate the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. The issue of subsidiarity has been around for some time. It figured greatly in the debate on EU membership that took place in the United Kingdom during the mid 1990s and it remains relevant.</P>
    <P>During the Nice campaign and before it I pointed out that the treaties governing the European Union are unintelligible for the average citizen and even for legal practitioners. A quick glance at the Constitution's references to the European Union proves my point as it amounts to a series of references to European treaties without any statements of principle or practice. Our membership of the EU as expressed in our Constitution is value-free. Perhaps a European constitution that determines precise competencies between European and national institutions will prove to be the best answer in the long run. It might also help to resolve the issue of what it means to be Irish and European at the same time.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the lack of constitutional and institutional clarity creates confusion and the impression, often the reality, of the European Union as a monolithic and unaccountable body. Those opposed to the European Union like to exaggerate its powers. They fail to refer to the role of national Governments in determining EU policy and seek to scapegoat the European Commission, an un-elected but nationally appointed body that is often charged with implementing the laws agreed by member states. It is a deeply unfair analysis. That is not to say that EU procedures do not need reform, they do. They are not nearly as open and transparent as they should be although Ireland has hardly been a leading advocate for change on that front.</P>
    <P>Much of the problem of accountability, and thereby the legitimacy of the European Union, lies within our domestic law and not within the inadequacies of the European Union, a point strongly made by the Labour Party in our Nice treaty policy document. It has since been made by the Attorney General, Michael McDowell, and was made during the referendum campaign by the former Attorney General, John Rogers. Specifically, the point made is that decisions taken in Europe are not subject to sufficient domestic scrutiny, and that is a fair point. This Bill primarily seeks to address the problem, but it needs to be seen in context. Until the radical transformation of our committee system here it could have been argued that neither European nor domestic legislation was subject to sufficient scrutiny. That is changing but issues remain about the relationship in this country between the Executive and the legislature. As the volume of legislative and administrative activity by the State <Col N="73" /> has increased, the capacity of the Oireachtas with the resources available to it to keep up has come into question.</P>
    <P>Socially our attitudes to scrutiny and transparency have been transformed too. In recent years we have seen all too clearly the inadequacies of our less questioning ways of doing business, particularly with regard to the treatment of children in institutions. We simply did our business in an excessively uncritical fashion, as we did with Europe. Times have changed, thankfully, as Ministers are increasingly held accountable for their actions, committees are doing much good work and Parliament is changing. Unfortunately, the media has not changed and work done in committees does not receive the attention it deserves. The impression that nothing happens unless the Dáil is in plenary session is an unfair one that receives excessive currency in some quarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions taken by Ministers in Europe with more far-reaching consequences than many domestic decisions do not receive a similar level of scrutiny. In many cases European decisions receive no attention, which is simply not good enough anymore. I do not wish to criticise the Government in making this point as successive Administrations showed a similar lack of accountability and scrutiny which this Bill aims to correct.</P>
      <P>I understand the Government will accept this Bill although to do anything less would have been a disgrace, particularly in light of the strong views put on the record by the Attorney General last week. I do not share his analysis and I disagree strongly with much of it. It is amusing to listen to his reference to the arrogance of those he calls federalists, bearing in mind his comments about Fianna Fáil, monkeys and the Maastricht treaty. It is similarly amusing to listen to the Attorney General's jibes about unelected advisors. Some of his comments, nonetheless, are worth repeating in this debate because he is right to identify the &ldquo;Dublin deficit&rdquo; in our dealings in Europe. In his speech to the Institute of European Affairs, the Attorney General said: &ldquo;That an Irish Minister should be technically at large free to negotiate a regulation or directive which as a matter of European and Irish law the Oireachtas is absolutely bound to accept is a striking proposition&rdquo;. He added: &ldquo;It is remarkable, therefore, that present legislative practice has imposed no prior obligation of consultation in routine legislative matters and an obligation to seek at least the consent of the Oireachtas where such a measure would inevitably control or delimit Constitutional guarantees&rdquo;. He is right on both accounts but if his Government accepts the legislation before us, that situation will be at an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Bill will also put into law beyond doubt that Ireland cannot participate in the rapid reaction force without a UN mandate. <Col N="74" /> The Government should not have any difficulty with these sections of the Bill &ndash; after all, it claims that this is already the legal position. However, sufficient doubts were raised during the course of the referendum debate to warrant removing any doubt about this and this is what the Bill seeks to do. I do not believe though that this should be the end of the debate about Ireland's role in the RRF or its competences.</P>
    <P>We are all on the horns of a dilemma in relation to the UN Security Council. Reform at the United Nations is essential. There is too much scope for the blocking of humanitarian action by major powers acting in their own selfish interests. Is China, for instance, in the moral position to adjudicate on the appropriate response to human rights abuses or even genocide on the European continent? The United Nations is not the only font of international law either &ndash; general principles exist, particularly since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the alternative to the United Nations is worse. Countries acting independent from and without recourse to international law are not acceptable either. They would set dangerous precedents and be subject to abuse. There is also no doubt the United Nations should be the ideal interpreter of such law. However, there is no getting away from the fact that this leaves us in a difficult position, particularly as a neutral state. Too often within living memory the United Nations and the European Union have stood aside in the face of massive human rights abuses and even genocide, recently too. It is something on which to ponder.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the details of the Bill. The legislation has two purposes. First, it introduces a set of procedures to enhance scrutiny by the Oireachtas of measures proposed to be taken by the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Provision is made for reporting to and consultation with relevant committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas by Ministers. These new procedures relate to measures taken under the first, European Communities, second, common foreign and security policy, and third, justice and home affairs, pillars of the Union.</P>
    <P>Taken by itself and without other reforms, the Bill will have no effect other than to overwhelm Oireachtas committees with paper. Complementary amendments to the Standing Orders of the Houses will be required in order that the Houses and their committees can adapt their procedures to cope with the additional workload. For example, a committee should be able to appoint one of their number as rapporteur on a particular issue and, if the Bill is accepted, additional resources and staff with appropriate expertise will also be necessary. The second purpose of the Bill is to amend the defence Acts to provide for participation by the Defence Forces in the EU's rapid reaction force, but only where the RRF is operating under a UN mandate.</P>
    <P>The first proposal is that no Minister may, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, commit the <Col N="75" /> Minister, any other Minister, the Government or the State to support for any EU legal instrument, such as a directive, regulation or convention, unless the proposal is first laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister having official responsibility and referred by him or her for consideration by the appropriate committee of the Houses. This requirement for prior publication to the Oireachtas will also apply to meetings preparatory to formal meetings of the Council of Ministers such as COREPER and extend to Ministers of State and all other persons, such as civil servants and ambassadors, authorised to act on behalf of or represent a Minister, the Government or the State.</P>
    <P>The publication before the Oireachtas of a proposal for a legal instrument will have to be accompanied by a statement outlining the background to and the purpose and likely impact of the proposal and the position proposed to be adopted by the Minister. The committee will then be in a position to hold hearings on the issue with written or oral evidence from interest groups and the Minister.</P>
    <P>If an appropriate committee decides within 21 days to consider a proposal for an EU legal instrument, the committee will report its findings and conclusions to either or both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution rejecting the proposal will be passed by either House within the next 21 days after the report, the Minister will not have any competence to support that proposal or bind any other Minister, the Government or the State in support of it. Rejecting a proposed legal instrument is the &ldquo;big stick&rdquo;. One might more easily imagine a committee calling for particular amendments or safeguards but it would be doing so from a position of strength.</P>
    <P>The Bill might be criticised because it will give the committees the &ldquo;big stick&rdquo; power to reject proposals but it will not give them a legal power to instruct a Minister on a negotiating position that must be adhered to. However, it is not practically feasible to try in legislation to confer power on the Oireachtas to bind a member of the Executive to a particular negotiating position on what might be a very complicated set of ongoing talks, compromises and deals. How would a court assess whether a plenipotentiary had exceeded his or her riding instructions? This is essentially a political rather than a legal issue. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure prior and public scrutiny. The consequences of ignoring the process should be for the Minister and political parties, rather than result in an attack on the validity of the legal instrument eventually produced.</P>
    <P>Every Minister will be obliged to report to the committee appropriate to his or her Department not less than once every two months on all significant developments in the European Union and the European Communities, relevant to his or her responsibilities, which have taken place since the last report or which he or she anticipates will arise within the next six months. The report must <Col N="76" /> include a statement of the position adopted or proposed to be adopted by the Minister on every matter covered.</P>
    <P>Under the European Communities Act, 1972, there is a much less onerous requirement for a single report, on behalf of the Government as a whole, dealing with developments that have taken place in the Communities within the previous six months. Understandably, a six monthly report dealing with the entirety of EU activity is not taken very seriously by anyone. The last such report dealt with the first half of 1999 and was published 16 months later in October 2000. These reports do not give rise to Dáil debates, since they are of historic interest only. It is deliberate, therefore, that the Bill proposes a six month prospectus for forthcoming issues from each Minister, with only a two month look-back.</P>
    <P>When the Council of Ministers and Parliament make a directive, it is binding as to the result to be achieved but it is left to each member state as to how to give effect to it. The European Communities Act, 1972, is the vehicle by which Ministers transpose European law into Irish law. It states the treaties governing the European Communities, and the existing and future Acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities, shall be binding on the State and part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties. It then states that any Minister has power to make regulations to enable this provision to have effect.</P>
    <P>Every Minister has power to make statutory instruments under the 1972 Act to give effect to European directives. The content may be anything from consumer protection, audit requirements for limited companies to rules for the stock exchange. Essentially, it is a decision for Ministers and their Departments as to whether they should give effect to a directive by introducing primary legislation for debate in the Oireachtas or just take the short cut and bring forward a statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>The leaning should be in favour of legislation by the Oireachtas, both on grounds of constitutional propriety and because such a process enhances public scrutiny. The SI route is too often chosen simply on grounds of convenience or because it is quicker and the Government is already behind in its implementation schedule. The only major issue that cannot be dealt with by way of statutory instrument under the 1972 Act is that such regulations may not create an indictable offence &ndash; a serious offence triable by judge and jury in the Circuit Court. Therefore, when the SI route is chosen, no matter how serious the subject matter, penalties for their breach are limited to District Court levels.</P>
    <P>The nod in the direction of Oireachtas scrutiny is found in the 1973 (Amendment) Act. The central provision is:</P>
    <P>If the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities recommends to the Houses of the Oireachtas that any regulations under this Act be annulled, <Col N="77" /> and a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by both such Houses within one year after the regulations are made, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly and shall cease to have statutory effect, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>The relevant committee is now the Joint Committee on European Affairs. There is provision in the Act for the recall of the Houses if regulations are made when they stand adjourned for more than ten days.</P>
    <P>In the 1970s the Houses did not have the comprehensive set of select and joint committees which now exist and which shadow Departments. There is no more logic in sending all statutory instruments under the European Communities Act to one committee than there would be in sending all Bills to one committee. It must be the case that that committee is overwhelmed by regulations and its scrutiny could, at best, be selective and cursory. No one can recall if the committee or its predecessors has recommended the annulment of a statutory instrument or considered a motion to do so.</P>
    <P>Rather than one committee being expected to scrutinise all statutory instruments made under the European Communities Act regardless of subject matter, such scrutiny should be carried out by the joint committee which has specific responsibility to deal with the area of public administration to which the statutory instrument relates. The Bill proposes, therefore, that each Oireachtas joint committee dealing with a Minister and Department be given this power in relation to its Minister. This &ldquo;after the event&rdquo; review procedure, taken together with the prior scrutiny of proposals for EU legislation and the bi-monthly reports, should add up to an opportunity for comprehensive and ongoing examination of legislative action taken by the Government at Council of Ministers level.</P>
    <P>The European Union's common foreign and security policy does not result in legislative acts, such as regulations or directives. It can, however, produce proposals for joint action by the member states. The Bill provides that, subject to certain qualifications, such proposals will have to be laid before the Houses and referred to the appropriate committee where they can be proposed for approval or rejection in reports to the Houses. Given that proposals for joint action may arise in a much shorter timeframe than applies to proposals for legislation, the Oireachtas will be empowered to shorten the normal 21 day time periods within which the committees can decide to act. The new rule will not prevent a Minister from agreeing to joint action under CFSP in a case where it is, in the opinion of the Government, urgently required. A decision may be needed on sanctions, for example. In such a case the Government will have to lay before both Houses a statement of the joint action agreed to, the reasons for the action and the grounds of urgency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> The Bill makes two amendments to the defence Acts. The law at present states that, subject to limited exceptions, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State as part of an international United Nations force, but only if a resolution has been passed by the Dáil approving the despatch of a contingent for service as part of that international United Nations force. The relevant section does not state that service outside the State by Defence Forces contingents can only be with a UN force or by a body which has a UN mandate; it stipulates that service with a UN force can only take place pursuant to a resolution of the Dáil. The Bill amends this by providing that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State, but only if such service is as part of an international United Nations force and a resolution has been passed by the Dáil approving the despatch of that contingent for service outside the State as part of that international United Nations force. The effect of the amendment will be to stipulate that the only service outside the State authorised by the section is with a UN force.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeats the limited exceptions set out in the existing Act where a Dáil resolution is not required, such as service with an unarmed force, service of not more than 12 personnel and replacement or reinforcement of a serving contingent. There is also a new exception in favour of service outside the State for the purpose of engaging only in joint training or joint exercises with the military or armed forces of member states of the European Union &ndash; the rapid reaction force.</P>
    <P>The definition of international United Nations force will be amended. The definition at present provides that such a force must be an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations. There is no provision in the definition to cover service with forces other than those established by the United Nations and which have been given a mandate by it. The reason is that the idea of the United Nations authorising peace-making by regional organisations, rather than creating its own specific force for a certain purpose, such as UNIFIL, is relatively recent. However, this idea has since been accepted as a more likely and workable approach.</P>
    <P>However, as a matter of Irish law, as it stands, legislation neither specifically enables nor lays down any conditions or restrictions for service by the Defence Forces with the rapid reaction force. There are no circumstances in which it could be argued that the rapid reaction force is an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations. The Bill will insert a new definition to provide that international United Nations force means an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations or an international force or body established by the member states of the <Col N="79" /> European Union, where that force or body has had particular functions given to it by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations, but such a force or body is an international United Nations force only in connection with and for the purposes of the performance of the functions so given.</P>
    <P>The effect of the two amendments taken together will be to confine service by Defence Forces contingents outside the State to international United Nations forces, but to provide that the rapid reaction force may fall within the definition of an international United Nations force, but only if and for so long as it is discharging a specific United Nations mandate.</P>
    <P>I gather and appreciate the Government will accept this Bill. As usual, my party is prepared to play a constructive role in any Committee Stage debate. We do not purport to have a monopoly of wisdom on this issue. However, I do not accept it should be sidelined by referring it to the National Forum on Europe. This is primarily a power for the Oireachtas. If we do not sign another European Treaty, these measures should be in place as they are long overdue.</P>
    <P>As a democracy, we are going through a difficult maturing process. Tribunals, the DIRT committee and challenges to the power of parliamentary committees in the High Court are proof of this. However, we will come out of this process a stronger and more committed democracy. As I said, I understand the Government will accept the principle of the Bill tonight and not oppose it on Second Stage. I hope it is a genuine acceptance of the principle of the Bill, not a device to delay taking crucial decisions. The whistleblower's Bill was accepted on Second Stage in September 1999 and has yet to move to Committee Stage, despite the Taoiseach's attempts to own the legislation.</P>
    <P>The most cynical use of this tactic by the Government has been in relation to the issue of political funding. The Labour Party had the Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill accepted on Second Stage in May last year, only to find that the Government blocked all further progress and refused to allow the committee to consider it. It then introduced its own separate legislation which sought to retain corporate donations, the direct opposite to the key aim of the Labour Party Bill it had accepted on Second Stage. I hope that will not be the case on this occasion. Had the Government accepted our suggestions on the Nice referendum, it might not now be in this mess. I hope having accepted the principle of the Bill, it will now facilitate an early discussion at the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I have not had the opportunity to speak on this issue since the defeat of the Nice referendum and I am sure you, a Cheann Comhairle, will forgive me if I touch on some of the issues which inevitably arise in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> I speak as someone who is persuaded of the merits of the European project, as it is usually called. Participation in the European Union and, before it, in the EEC and the EC has been unambiguously good for Ireland politically, socially and economically. We are a different country and people from what we were 30 years ago and most, if not all of that is for the good. I say that as an Irish person but also as someone who comes from these benches and holds the political views of democratic socialists. We have found great solace in participating with those of a similar political view and advancing on a multinational level throughout the European Union the political views we hold strongly, such as exerting and extending the rights of workers and women. The progress made in this country might not have been made, or made at the same pace, were it not for participation in the European Union. It has been good for us both politically and socially.</P>
    <P>The question of identity is central to the way we approach this issue. I am a Dublin person, but I am also Irish and a European. I see that as being rolled up in one. There are no choices to be made and one is not diminished by being more of the other. They are all complementary. My pleasure in despatching the Minister's county football team to the obscurity from which it came is no less diminished by the fact we are both Irish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My pleasure and pride in things Irish are no less diminished by the fact that I also consider myself to be a European. It is important to put that on the record because if one listens to the people who are primarily making the case against the Nice treaty, that is not the way they talk. According to them, Europe is out there, things are forced on us by Europe and Europeans are other people; we are not Europeans but Irish. It is the splendid isolation theory of bygone decades and centuries where it should have been left. If there is a problem, and there is, with the democratic deficit in Europe, it is as much a problem for us as it is for Europe and it is as much caused by us as it is caused by the European institutions. The fact that we do not have a proper reporting mechanism to the Dáil is not the fault of the European institutions as such; it is very much the fault of this House and this country and is something we have failed to grapple with in any serious way over the past 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure, if that is the right word, in the previous Dáil of being a member of the committee which dealt with secondary European legislation and it was one of the most turgid, tedious experiences I have ever had. For the three or four meetings we had, we were confronted with tomes of draft regulations, statutory instruments and so on, usually inches thick, which some unfortunate civil servant had been asked to go through to try to identify some of the major issues that might arise. It is fair to say that nobody on the <Col N="81" /> committee felt it was a worthwhile process. Certainly none of the unfortunate civil servants who were charged with doing most of the work involved thought it was worthwhile and, other than providing a fig leaf in terms of accountability, it was a worthless process and one we should not repeat.</P>
    <P>We must work out some mechanism whereby we can have reporting to and through this House and through the media to our citizens at large that is relevant and can, in the first instance, distil the issues of interest to people and provoke some sort of debate, ideally at the time it is relevant and not six months or a year later. The mechanism set out in the Bill is a reasonable effort to do that. What we are suggesting, in effect, is that Ministers should come into committees, whether it is the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, the Committee on Finance and the Public Service or whatever, before a relevant council meeting, set out, broadly speaking, the stall of the Department and the view the Minister will take at the Council meeting, take on board any suggestions the committee might make, and seek to represent those at the Council meeting. It would obviously make sense if that Minister were to report back to the same committee within a short time of arriving back from the Council meeting and reaching whatever agreement or compromise that is reached. We would have consultation in advance of the decision and a reporting back process after the decision is taken at European level.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that much of this will not be controversial or even interesting, but it does provides a mechanism, as do all of the other committees of this House, in that when an issue of interest, controversy or relevance arises, it can be dealt with in a fairly expeditious way which will not unduly tax the committees and which, I hope, will provide a platform whereby it can be reported more generally. If, for example, the Taoiseach had been obliged to appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs in advance of the treaty being negotiated in Nice, set out the Irish position and report immediately afterwards on how it had gone, that would have been a healthy development. It did not happen in that way, however, and it does not happen in that way with regard to General Affairs Councils either.</P>
    <P>We also have a difficulty with the European Parliament, and the solution is not all that obvious. We elect our Members of the European Parliament once every five years and, to all intents and purposes, we then forget about them. They have a limited platform in the committees of this Dáil, which some of them take up while others do not, but, sadly, there is no real mechanism whereby we hold our Members of the European Parliament to account in relation to European issues. When one considers that many of them were probably elected despite their views on European issues rather than because of them, that is no surprise.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the rapid reaction force. The Minister and the House will be aware of the back<Col N="82" /> ground of the Labour Party on issues of neutrality. We have been strong supporters of Irish neutrality over the years and it is fair to say that was particularly the case before the fall of the Berlin Wall during the Cold War when the neutrality as espoused by this party was not only one of military neutrality but would also have had a distinct ideological tint to it. Those days are gone. We have moved on and there is a need, which everybody acknowledges, to redefine what we mean by neutrality within the context of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The events in Bosnia in the mid-1990s were decisive in determining my attitude to these matters. If we recall the establishment of the United Nations safe havens in Bosnia in places like Gorazde and Srebrenica, and what subsequently happened there, it is very difficult to make any serious argument against the rapid reaction force. If we recall, in particular, Srebrenica, where teenage Dutch and Spanish soldiers were obliged to stand by when the male occupants of the town were literally taken out and shot in the woods, I do not believe anybody could argue for non-intervention in those circumstances. I found it morally impossible to argue that the United States and its President could effectively have vetoed our capacity to intervene in those circumstances to stop the bloodletting that happened in those awful days, and it should not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>Throughout the 1990s, and a relatively benign US Presidency under Bill Clinton, we were incapable, as Europeans, of intervening to prevent widespread bloodshed and genocide which was operated as a matter of policy by a European Government. That should have given all of us cause to stand back and consider how we go from there and the design that would be necessary in the future to give us that capacity. The capacity comes in two ways; it is military and political. As Europeans, we have to find within ourselves the political will to say that cannot happen ever again within the boundaries of Europe. We have to insist, if needs be by the threat of force, on the primacy of democracy and sorting these matters out by political exchange only.</P>
    <P>In order to find that political will and to make it happen, however, we need to have a military capacity available to us. All of us in this House, and everybody in Ireland with our traditions, will insist that could only come into play by decision of this House and that we should be entitled to withdraw whatever capacity we make available if we decide that a particular operation is not appropriate. We should insist on a whole range of other preconditions such as a United Nations mandate before intervening, but ultimately we cannot allow genocide and widespread bloodshed in Europe to happen simply because the President of the United States will not intervene, and we cannot intervene. That is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the issues that have been raised by the Nice referendum, I read with interest the article written, under the Tánaiste's <Col N="83" /> name at least, in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week and I found to my surprise that I had a great deal in common with it. In the article the Tánaiste, or whoever wrote the article on her behalf, sought to make the case that the argument between those of us who are basically in favour of the European project is not about sovereignty but the kind of Europe we have, and in many ways she is right. I think she described herself as a Dutch type liberal and that she was not in favour of &ndash; she did not use this phrase but this is what she meant &ndash; interfering with the free market on a European basis because she was not in favour of interfering with the free market in Ireland and that she was not in favour of the social Europe because she is not in favour of the social Ireland. That is a reasonable point for her to make. There is an important difference of political philosophy which is at the centre of political debate both here and on the European stage, but she made the important point, and this is why I repeat it now, that this does not necessarily coincide with the argument made by others about sovereignty because sovereignty is based on national control. For example, the Tánaiste was opposed to regulation of any kind. She did not want it happening in Ireland or Europe and it was not really a matter of whether sovereignty was ceded.</P>
    <P>Most of those who opposed the Nice treaty do not come from that point of view. They talk about sovereignty as if it was something indivisible, as if retaining our sovereignty necessarily guaranteed something which it does not guarantee. It does not guarantee that we would have more of a say over our own future. As a social democrat, we have a duty to intervene in the free market and to secure for our citizens and workers rights which will not be guaranteed by the free market. At the start of the 21st century, that intervention can only take place on a supranational level because to do it on a national level would bring with it economic consequences which we should not contemplate. It is a necessary corollary for us that if we believe in those rights, as we do, they can be most effectively agreed on an international basis.</P>
    <P>I protest against the sanctimonious nature of some of what has been said by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners since the defeat of the Nice referendum, as if the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote were the settled view of the Irish people. I am a democrat and I respect the right of the people to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Nice treaty. I disagree with that vote and over the coming period we need to take the argument forward to deal with some of the issues which came up, hopefully with a view to persuading people to change their minds.</P>
    <P>However, I resent that people, some of whom are not known for their democratic credentials, who have opposed our participation in Europe for the past 30 years, suddenly expect that now that they have managed to bring off one victory, the rest of us will say, &ldquo;That's the end of that little matter&rdquo;. That is not the case. This result is <Col N="84" /> part of a healthy continuing debate which those of us who lost the referendum are as entitled to a part of as those who won this victory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the contributions of Deputies Quinn and McDowell which set an interesting context for the contents of this Bill and what is seeks to achieve, and made some interesting observations in the aftermath of the referendum. However, the analysis of there being a competing view between those who wish to see a liberal, non-social Europe and those who favour a social Europe which takes on the responsibilities of civilised nations is an attempt to create a gap where none exists. The Treaty of Rome and subsequent treaties incorporate all of these social rights, and all parties have been proponents of pursuing those rights and entitlements.</P>
      <P>We do not do ourselves a service if, in trying to analyse the situation and how we go forward, we try to suggest that there are greater differences between pro-European parties than we would like to be the case. I have seen this kind of analysis articulated in the media for some time. It succumbs to the tyranny of the soundbite in trying to extrapolate an argument from a Berlin versus Brussels analysis which itself does no justice to the speech concerned. It is always a problem that some seek to encapsulate considered policy positions in nice soundbites for editorials. However, such soundbites are not practical in terms of a considered political debate in this House in the aftermath of the referendum or as part of the continuing European debate.</P>
      <P>Antonio Guterres is a socialist whom I respect. At the Feira summit Mr. Gutteres ensured that we set as an objective that the EU would become the most competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world in the next decade. This does not suggest that his commitment to a social Europe is in any way diminished, nor does it suggest that the Heads of State and Government who agreed to these conclusions are more committed to competitiveness than to the social objectives which European integration and the European ideal will bring about.</P>
      <P>It must always be stated that one needs to ensure economic progress to provide sustainable social advances. One of the lessons which has been learned, particularly by socialists, is that it is an unsustainable false argument to promote the idea of social advance in isolation from the need for economic progress.</P>
      <P>I was taken by Deputy McDowell's contribution. Sometimes our analysis over-emphasises points of difference which, when examined, are not as great as some would like to suggest. It is more about people creating a political space in terms of their electoral prospects than it is about the reality. However, it is a legitimate party exercise in which to be involved.</P>

      <P>The Ministers for Finance and ECOFIN comprise a powerful Council. The conclusions of the European Council and the ability of the Council to set the agenda for all the sectoral Councils has been one of the outcomes of the Feira process for which Mr. Guterres is to be congratulated. However, these are general points which are not germane to the specifics of this debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Government to the European Union Bill proposed by Deputy Quinn. The Government fully recognises the need to bring the work of the European Union closer to its citizens. A key element in achieving this objective is to ensure greater transparency in the conduct of Community business, and, thereby, give the citizen a renewed sense of ownership of what is being done in his or her name. It is obvious that on-going and effective parliamentary scrutiny and participation is essential in this regard. Such a process contributes to building a culture of trust and to reinforcing the sense of democratic accountability which is the key to public confidence in any legislative process.</P>
      <P>It is in this spirit that I welcome Deputy Quinn's Bill as a useful contribution to the debate on how we can best strengthen national procedures in this important area. We will obviously wish to proceed with this matter on a basis which takes full account of the complexity of the issues involved, and which at the same time commands the widest possible support in the House.</P>
      <P>This debate takes place in the context of the outcome of the recent referendum. In this regard, and in response to those who have suggested otherwise, I emphasise that our partners, whose political leaders the Taoiseach and I met most recently at Gothenburg, fully respect the views of the Irish electorate, and recognise its sovereign right to decide as it sees fit.</P>
      <P>We as a Government have a duty to proceed in this area in a manner which best protects the national interest. In doing so, we must take account of a number of realities. The first is that the commitment to enlargement must be maintained. All sides to the debate agree on that. However, while appreciating our assurances, it has to be said that the candidate states are in no doubt that the Treaty of Nice remains essential to realising their ambition for membership. They welcome our commitment to enlargement but are anxious that we also provide them with the means to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reality is that the other member states are not prepared to re-negotiate the treaty agreed at Nice. This is an important statement by the other 14 member states, supported by the applicant countries, of their political and legal position. It demands respect, just as our position requires respect. It means that each member state is fully entitled to pursue national ratification in line with its own democratic procedures. The insistence by some on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side that other countries halt their national ratification pro<Col N="86" /> cedures itself constitutes a refusal to respect the independence of the individual member states.</P>
    <P>The third reality is that the treaty can only come into effect if all 15 member states choose to ratify it. In our case that decision, for which the deadline is December 2002, is, and will remain, the prerogative of the Irish people. However, the heads of Government did reaffirm their readiness to do everything possible to meet the particular concerns highlighted by the Irish referendum result.</P>
    <P>The fourth reality is that the referendum result clearly showed that many ordinary citizens feel disconnected from the Union's decision-making process. It is in this context that the Government, well in advance of the referendum, signalled its readiness to proceed with the establishment of the national forum on Europe. In the same spirit we have also recognised that it was necessary to address the question of improving our procedures for scrutiny by the Oireachtas of European Union business.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to parliamentary oversight are matters entirely within our competence. It was for this reason that I was surprised during the referendum campaign that some commentators invoked the need for reforms in this area as a justification for voting against the Nice treaty. The treaty contains nothing which precludes the organisation of our domestic monitoring arrangements on the basis judged most appropriate by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is in many respects ironic that discussion of this issue is proceeding in the aftermath of the negative result of the Nice referendum. In the declaration on the future of the Union, the Treaty of Nice provides for an intensive process of debate and consultation on the future development of the European Union. Among the issues which it identified for further consideration was the role of national parliaments in the European Union framework. This would examine in detail a range of proposals for more active involvement by national Parliaments in the work of the European Union.</P>
    <P>There are already arrangements in place which, through the Joint Committee on European Affairs, provide an important role for the Oireachtas in reviewing and advising on EU developments. The committee's terms of reference empower it to consider a wide range of matters arising from Ireland's membership of the European Communities. For example, under the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973, the joint committee can recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that regulations made by Ministers under the Act be annulled. The recommendation is then debated in the House which can pass a resolution to that effect. This is a severe sanction which has not been put into effect here.</P>
    <P>Of perhaps greater operational relevance is the committee's power to consider proposals for Community legislation, as well as drafts of regulations, directives, decisions and recommend<Col N="87" /> ations of the Council of Ministers. It is recognised on all sides that in this complex area the committee has worked hard and effectively to discharge a difficult and constantly expanding task. However, I would be the first to acknowledge, as has been argued eloquently by the chairman of the committee, that there is scope for considerable improvement of the existing arrangements. The volume of material coming before the committee continues to increase and poses a major challenge, not only in terms of quantity but also as regards the technical complexity of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The case for a significant overhaul of our oversight procedures is well made. There is clearly a need for an extensive and detailed examination of how best our current arrangements can be strengthened and made more effective. The Bill tabled by Deputy Quinn is a welcome and important contribution to that debate. The Bill rightly raises the issue of how best our oversight machinery can deal with proposals within the EU system while draft legislation is still in preparation. It also highlights the question of the role of Oireachtas committees with specialist briefs in relation to various Departments, and how this could complement the work of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
    <P>The question of the most appropriate procedures for briefing of committees by Ministers and Departments is also usefully highlighted. We wish to examine all these issues fully and carefully, taking into account also the need to ensure the most effective use is made of modern information technology systems. However, it will also be necessary to ensure any new procedures are workable and compatible with our obligations at EU level. The Bill does not differentiate sufficiently between the wide range of EU decision-making procedures where the timescales for implementation can differ considerably. The Bill also omits other categories of measures which one might wish to bring within its scope, for example, resolutions, declarations or statements in the Council minutes. The Bill also does not indicate with sufficient precision at what moment a measure would come within its scope.</P>
    <P>The proposed timescale which could delay the taking of a position for up to 42 days, two periods of 21 days each, will also need to be considered very carefully. This could prove very difficult to operate in the context of fast moving negotiations. The Bill also does not take account of the fact, as anyone who has participated in Council will be aware, that proposals are amended in the course of negotiations, and it is essential that the Government's representatives are in a position to respond, including in situations where a vote is called in the Council before the domestic parliamentary procedure has been completed.</P>
    <P>I note, for example, that there is some recognition of the need for an urgent procedure in respect of joint actions under common foreign and security policy matters, but not in respect of the first <Col N="88" /> or third pillars. In addition, it would be necessary to make appropriate provision for the necessary resources for both the committees and the Departments concerned in implementing improved review procedures. I raise these points not in any negative sense but simply to illustrate the fact that this is a complex area which requires detailed examination before decisions are taken with potentially very significant implications.</P>
    <P>Recently, I have also had an interesting and productive discussion on these matters with Deputy Durkan, the chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, and the convenor of that committee, Deputy Pat Carey. Deputy Wall was unavoidably absent on that occasion. They have been in a position to give us the benefit of the valuable experience gained by the committee in the practical implementation of the oversight arrangements. In this regard, it is fully recognised that the overall objective is an optimal level of accountability which ensures effective parliamentary oversight, while at the same time enabling Ministers and their representatives to operate within the Council with the degree of responsiveness and flexibility necessary to ensure the interests of the country are fully protected in any fast moving negotiating process.</P>
    <P>There is recognition on all sides of the need to get that balance right. Given the far reaching implications of changes in this area, the Government will consider carefully the changes which might be made, including the proposals in Deputy Quinn's Bill, and, in due course, bring forward its own considered response in this regard. Decisions in this area are primarily a matter for the Oireachtas. We wish to proceed to the greatest extent possible on a cross-party basis, recognising our common interest in the effective functioning of our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the draft Bill relates to the European Union's common foreign and security policy. The Government is fully committed to openness and transparency about the EU's role in the world and Ireland's input to that role. In the course of this year, I have answered approximately 300 parliamentary questions from Deputies about our approach to EU foreign policy on issues ranging from, for example, the Middle East and the western Balkans, to East Timor. In addition, debates in this House, the Seanad and the Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs have provided opportunities to discuss and review these and other important issues.</P>
    <P>The Government is certainly open to suggestions for ways in which it can improve understanding in the Oireachtas and the public at large of what the EU's role in the world is and should be, and what contribution Ireland can and should make in that regard. Enhancing Ireland's national role in the development and conduct of EU foreign and security policy has certainly been a priority for the Government. This has also been reflected in the read across to our membership of the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> It is worth recalling that Ireland has been participating in consultations and co-operation on foreign policy issues with our partners in Europe since we first joined the EEC in 1973. Starting with European political co-operation, as it was then called, through to the development in the Treaty of Maastricht of what we now call the common foreign and security policy which came into operation in November 1993, Ireland has had the opportunity to consult, debate, and very often, agree on foreign policy positions or courses of action with our EU partners across a whole range of foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>On those occasions when the EU member states reach agreement and speak with one voice &ndash; for example, in the United Nations on many issues, or in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &ndash; our combined weight can be very important in building international consensus and in promoting our world view in favour of the peaceful settlement of disputes, democratisation and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Ireland's experience over nearly 30 years is that our involvement in the formulation of EU foreign and security policy enhances our voice in the world.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that Ireland was at the table and negotiated as full and equal partners the treaty provisions on the European Union's common foreign and security policy. The EU treaties set out the objectives of its common foreign and security policy which include: the preservation of peace and strengthening of international security, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter, as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, and the objectives of the Paris Charter, including those on external borders; the promotion of international co-operation; and the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    <P>Ireland contributed to the formulation of these objectives which reflect principles and objectives that have always informed our own foreign policy traditions. These objectives inspire and provide a yardstick for the conduct of the European Union on the world stage. Among the concerns voiced during the debate on the Treaty of Nice were concerns that the European Union was becoming a super state with ambitions to throw its weight around on the international stage. Others, on the other hand, have criticised the European Union for failing to live up to its obligations in the wider world and contribute more effectively to conflict prevention and crisis management. We need to explore these concerns and criticisms in depth and achieve a much better public understanding about the European Union's role in the world, and how EU foreign and security policy is negotiated and implemented.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I welcome the suggestions in the Bill. I am, and the Government is, open to considering any suggestions or ideas that can enhance discussion, debate and understanding of the role of the European Union on the inter<Col N="90" /> national stage, and the scope that this gives to Ireland to pursue our foreign and security policy goals and objectives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn's Bill also contains proposals for amendments to the defence Acts in relation to service abroad by members of the Permanent Defence Force. While the Deputy will appreciate that responsibility for this legislation lies with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, I am glad, on behalf of the Government, to welcome any suggestions consonant with the position consistently articulated by the Government, namely, that the deployment of Irish personnel and resources in any overseas missions will only be considered by the Government where a UN mandate is already in place. The Government is open to having this position clarified further. As part of its ongoing efforts to dispel fears and anxieties which arose in the lead-up to the referendum, we are examining what steps can be taken to allay people's concerns.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill contains specific provision for Ireland to participate in crisis management activities which might arise in an EU framework and under an UN umbrella. I welcome this approach which acknowledges that developments within the EU and UN in this area have proceeded in concert and will continue to do so. This point has been made clear by both sides on numerous occasions, including at a meeting between UN Secretary General Annan, and EU Foreign Ministers held in May and in formal conclusions adopted subsequently by the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>As with all aspects of our involvement in the activities of the European Union, but particularly when we have such an extensive history of involvement in UN peacekeeping activity, it is essential that the issues are debated thoroughly on the basis of the facts. We should not proceed on the basis of scare-mongering, unfounded perceptions of what the EU is doing in this field or, in particular, as if the horrific events which we witnessed in the Balkans region over the past decade had never taken place. The efforts we are contributing to in the EU context are fully consistent with Ireland's tremendous record of involvement in UN peacekeeping operations over the past 40 years. I want Ireland to continue to play its part in preventing conflict and to have a positive role in international peacekeeping. To do otherwise is to fly in the face of efforts to try to prevent events such as the terrible ethnic strife in the Balkans region from recurring.</P>
    <P>An equal if not greater disservice is done to the electorate if we do not make a positive contribution in keeping with our traditions and values. Whether by the design of some or through genuine misunderstanding and fear, doubt and confusion have crept into the debate on Ireland's role in European security and defence policy issues and how we should play our part in the international community. For instance, there has been confusion regarding the description of the <Col N="91" /> capabilities for the EU headline goal as a rapid reaction force. It is emphatically not a standing army nor does it impinge on Ireland's policy of military neutrality to which the Government remains firmly committed. Rather the rapid reaction force is a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out humanitarian or crisis management operations.</P>
    <P>It is also important to highlight that European security and defence policy is not an exclusively military project. Extensive work has been done by the outgoing Swedish EU Presidency to ensure progress on civilian crisis management capabilities, particularly in the area of policing. Sweden has also presided over important developments in the field of conflict prevention. As the EU programme agreed in Gothenburg points out, &ldquo;The development of ESDP has, since the outset, been intended to strengthen the EU's capacity for action on the crucial field of conflict prevention&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have regularly briefed the House on these developments and on those under previous presidencies. I accept that greater efforts will have to be made to keep both the Oireachtas and the public fully informed on these matters. I will, therefore, approach future debates regarding Deputy Quinn's Bill in full listening mode.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for the Bill he has put before the House. Action in this area is important, both in itself and also to underline the seriousness with which the Government takes the message conveyed by the electorate on 7 June. The Government is accountable to the Dáil and this fact must be fully reflected in our activity at European Union level. The Government will act quickly in this area and bring forward its views at an early date.</P>
    <P>Transparency and accountability are not discretionary add-ons, they are the entitlement of the public in a democratic society. Moreover, I am confident that as the public becomes more familiar with what transpires at European level as distinct from the distortion and misinformation which is put in circulation by those who should know better, it will come to appreciate the enormous benefits which we in Ireland derive from our full participation in the European Union, and recognise that our continued active involvement in an enlarged Union on a basis which protects the essential role of the individual member states offers by far the best approach to the protection and promotion of our vital political and economic interests in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government does not propose to oppose the Bill on Second Stage this evening. I have indicated that the Government has a very positive disposition on the principle of greater parliamentary scrutiny and participation. We will need to examine very closely the detailed proposals in the Bill. I have asked the Attorney General's office to proceed with the necessary detailed examination as soon as possible. Observations will also be sought from the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. <Col N="92" /> When that is done, we will consult again with the Opposition. The Government will, in due course, bring forward considered proposals in respect of the issues raised by the Bill. We welcome its overall purpose without committing ourselves as to its specific content at this stage, pending careful further examination and consideration of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>It is the wish of the House that we get this right. I am aware that, in particular, we will want to ensure that the room for manoeuvre essential for Ministers involved in Council negotiations is maintained. As presently drafted, there could be a delay of up to 42 days between tabling a proposal and the Government taking a position. Flexibility is conceded only in relation to CFSP joint actions in the Bill as it currently stands. We are all agreed that in improving the situation that presently pertains, it is not anyone's intention to limit our capacity to operate effectively in Council. I am sharing my time with Deputy Carey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill addresses issues of particular importance not just in the context of ongoing debate prompted by the Nice referendum result, but also on the fundamental functions of the Oireachtas. As is appropriate with proposals of such importance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated the Government's intention to study them carefully and respond in detail and at length without undue delay. The Minister also correctly pointed out that this is fundamentally not a party political matter. All-party consensus is critical if such reforms are to have the desired effect of allowing the Oireachtas to properly exercise its oversight functions, while enabling the Government of the day to continue to function effectively at the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>We have procedures for reviewing actions taken by Ministers at EU level. As a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs I have firsthand experience of assessing the impact on Ireland of proposed EU legislation. I, like Deputy Durkan and others, have had to deal with those turgid inches of documents that we receive on a fortnightly basis. The committee's terms of reference allow fairly wide-ranging powers. I acknowledge the reference in the Minister's speech to our meeting with him last week. However, it is correct to recognise that the volume of EU business exceeds the resources of the committee to monitor it all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of such developments the Government is anxious that reforms be made which meet the requirement for full accountability and transparency of Government activity at EU level. Extending the oversight role currently exercised by the Committee on European Affairs to other committees would, if adequate resources are made available, allow fuller and more detailed examination of legislation. The Bill fails to distinguish between the different types of EU instruments which may be relevant or the different stages involved in adopting EU legislation. It will serve no-one's interest for committees to be sub<Col N="93" /> merged in a deluge of paper. What is appropriate is parliamentary oversight of key elements of legislation and of Ireland's role in the adoption of such instruments. The Committee on European Affairs will examine those matters very shortly.</P>
    <P>While there is pressure for an immediate response and a sense of wishing to be seen to do something following the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, rushed or incomplete legislation is not the answer. The Government has repeatedly said that it wishes to reflect on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and consider the concerns expressed in detail. The Minister has pointed out that the need to improve our domestic scrutiny procedures somehow became a reason for voting against the Nice treaty. Such a position is simply illogical. Nothing in the Nice treaty affects the ability of the Oireachtas to hold the Government to account for its actions at EU level. This remains a purely domestic matter which we must resolve in accordance with our assessment of best practice. However, it is fair to say that this was far from being the only reason outside the scope of the treaty which caused people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In developing the national system of scrutiny of EU activity, the Oireachtas will be serving two purposes. It will ensure the accountability of Government activity in Europe and show the public that EU business is conducted in a transparent and democratic manner. A greater public awareness of what transpires at EU level will dispel some of the worries which exist. People will, we hope, come to understand those areas in which the European Union is empowered to act and those in which it is not. They will see that, in the vast majority of cases, Ireland's national interests coincide with those of the rest of Europe and we are rarely, if ever, in a minority with regard to legislative proposals. They will also see the vital role played by the directly elected European Parliament in the Union's legislative process.</P>
    <P>While I and the Minister have pointed out that such developments are independent of the Nice treaty, the willingness of the Government to address itself to such proposals indicates the seriousness with which we view the concerns reflected in the outcome of the referendum. The Government is particularly anxious to respond to such concerns in the knowledge that those who raise them are not opposed to the essential purpose of the Nice treaty which is enlargement of the Union. It also offered, purely in the context of a future debate on the development of the European Union, a chance to review the role national parliaments play in the European framework. At present COSAC, of which the Joint Committee on European Affairs is the Irish constituent, allows parliamentary committees from all member states to consider matters of mutual interest. It is widely recognised that national parliaments continue to be the primary source of democratic identification for citizens throughout the European Union. It is precisely in recognition of this that the declaration on the future work of <Col N="94" /> the Nice treaty suggests that the role played by national parliaments in the EU framework be considered further. Many would like to augment or enhance this role, but the Nice treaty does not prejudge any decisions that might be made some way down the line. In voting against the treaty, those who claim they were protecting democracy have ended up hindering this debate, which will also address the need to improve and monitor the democratic legitimacy of the Union and its institutions to bring them closer to the citizens of member states. Such questions will no doubt be addressed at some length at the forum on Europe due to be established in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Durkan.</P>
      <P>This is a very useful debate but it would clearly have been even more useful had we had it before the referendum on the Nice treaty. The reason for this debate is the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. If there had been a positive response from the electorate to the proposals to endorse the treaty, there would have been the usual cursory comments about the need for more debate on European issues and there the matter would have rested. That is what happened on each of the previous occasions. The world has changed since the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum. Though I am strongly in favour of the treaty going through, that is the silver lining in the cloud. Let us be clear on what we are talking about this evening. We are talking about the inadequacies of national procedures for reviewing Community legislation and the Irish democratic deficit.</P>
      <P>Some raise the issue of the democratic deficit in Europe but that is an altogether separate issue. There is a question of how the Commission is appointed and the fact that there is a virtually unelected body in Europe with the powers it has. I say that not as a criticism because I am a great supporter of the Commission and the way it operates. In my experience it has always been very favourable to smaller member states and for that reason there has been an affinity between the views of Irish representatives and those of the Commission. However, it is an unelected body. There is also the issue that the decision making body, the Council of Ministers, meets in private and Ministers do not always explain in detail how decisions were arrived at. That is another issue on which there could be a debate some day. It is important to be clear that here we are talking about the Irish democratic deficit. I noted the newspaper article before the referendum written by the former Attorney General, John Rogers. I strongly disagreed with most of what he wrote with the exception of his highlighting of the existence of an Irish democratic deficit. The conclusion he drew was utterly erroneous when he pointed to it as a reason to vote against the Nice treaty. The treaty had nothing to do with it. It is a matter entirely in our own hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world has changed and no Government, not this one or the next &ndash; which will I hope be <Col N="95" /> drawn from this side of the House &ndash; can take the result of any future referendum for granted. In this case the Government took the complacent view that the people would do what they had always done and vote the treaty through. It will not happen again. From that point of view alone Governments will have to be cognisant of the future need to deal with the Irish democratic deficit. This discussion is therefore very useful. There will always be proposals for further treaties &ndash; there is already one around the corner &ndash; and a need for more referendums. The people will not accept such treaties in the future, here or elsewhere. Remember, in some other member states referendums may also be necessary. Denmark has had a number of them, as have some of the others. The people must have ownership of the European project. Unless they feel they are part of the decision making process they will not accept that the decisions are theirs. The only way they can be part of the decision making process is to have their own parliament with the constituent parts thereof being involved. That is the merit of this Bill and the reason I support it in principle.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs carries out its Trojan work in virtual secret, not because the chairman has issued a diktat, but because it is largely ignored by the media. How can the media be encouraged to take an interest in European affairs? It is understandable that when there is a referendum or an issue at the hustings the media take notice. It is also understandable when there is an upset, as there was in this referendum, but already the interest has faded. Count the numbers in the press gallery for this debate tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what was often said about Deputies when they were criticised for not being in the House. It is another problem that we will possibly have to address separately. The main point is that there has to be greater transparency. It is a question of how to make up for the democratic deficit in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from coping with the rejection of the treaty, there are already issues to be discussed at the next Intergovernmental Conference in three years time, a conference which we may be chairing. There is the question of the division of responsibilities between the member states and the Union. There is the question of the status of the charter on fundamental rights and the question of the simplification of the treaties to make them clearer and better understood while retaining their meaning. The role of national parliaments in the EU framework will also have to be considered. These are the four issues which have already been selected for discussion at the next Intergovernmental Conference. There have been a number of visionary speeches from Tony Blair, Gerhard Schröeder and Lionel Jospin and the <Col N="96" /> question is how do we react to them. We should put together our own thoughts as to what we want and not be reactive, we should be proactive. We should set down the vision we, as a small member state, have of the best way forward for Europe. We should involve the public as much as possible in order that when the Ministers of the day project that view at an Intergovernmental Conference or elsewhere, they have behind them the weight of the people's support. That is the way to ensure any subsequent referendum will have massive support.</P>
    <P>There needs to be greater focus on what is happening in Europe. Even at this late stage, in the dying days of this Administration, the Taoiseach could make a modest contribution by appointing a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. If we are to have more discussion on Europe, greater contact with committees and interfacing with the public, a Minister of State for European affairs must be appointed to take responsibility for that. I say that without criticising the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has other responsibilities. When I raised this during the Estimates debate in committee last week I was told that the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs was performing a useful role. However, she is a Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and the budget for that will develop enormously. In proposing the appointment of a Minister of State for European affairs I am not criticising the work of the present Minister of State who has another job to do.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should adopt this Bill in principle and say well done to the Labour Party for producing it. We should tease out aspects of the Bill and see how best to establish procedures which will deal with the problems I have highlighted. There is a problem and all sides would accept that. I differ slightly from the Labour Party in that I do not think there is a single solution to this problem and that merely passing a Bill such as this will resolve it. Going back to my early days in the Dáil, I served on the committee which dealt with secondary legislation of the European Community and I saw what was referred to earlier as the dry, turgid and uninteresting work that was involved. It did not excite me in any way and never excited any media interest. We should adopt a more broad-based approach. This matter was examined by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution four years ago. It issued a second report identifying the problem and said that Ireland's membership of the EU had created a broad bridge over which a huge volume of regulations, directives, recommendations and opinions were carried. It stated that there were insufficient checks on that traffic. The report suggested that the Seanad could play a major role in ensuring that the important task of surveillance and monitoring would be carried out.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of using either the Seanad or an Oireachtas committee, there could be a role <Col N="97" /> for both &ndash;  the Joint Committee on European Affairs in particular &ndash; as well as having more debate in the Dáil on such matters. Such debates should follow the sifting of items that could be or are controversial. John Rogers mentioned the fact that there was no debate on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial cases with reference to the famous Brussels II document. There was, as an opt-in proposal had to be adopted by the House and Seanad but one might ask if there should have been more debate thereafter before the Ministers finally committed themselves to the proposal. Should there be some procedure where we could sift out controversial proposals and then have whatever debate is considered necessary on those?</P>
    <P>We should also consider what is happening in other member states. We should have a clear idea of that and I would like reports on what other member states are doing. Someone referred to the House of Lords. When I went to Council meetings, the Danish Foreign Minister often referred to the activities of his foreign affairs committee. I would like to know more about what happens there and in other member states.</P>
    <P>This is not the end of the debate on this issue but the beginning. The Labour Party has rightly identified the need to do something about the democratic deficit and has come up with a very good proposal which is part of the solution. From here on we must tease out this and other proposals so that we can do something positive about this problem. If we do not put a package together now to deal with this we will face the same problem in the near future. The public will not understand what is happening and will refuse to accept any further change by way of future referenda on the development of the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for sharing his time and I congratulate the Labour Party on introducing this Bill, which has the effect of focussing on an issue which is in everyone's thoughts, nationally and internationally. It also focusses on the need to bridge the gap between European institutions and national Parliaments and between those Parliaments and the people. Various remedies will be suggested as to how best to address the complex issues and in the aftermath of the Nice treaty referendum there is a strong body of opinion that the contents of the treaty have been rejected and that as a result it will have to be modified.</P>
      <P>We know how the European system works. Any differences between the 15 States are dealt with by derogations or an opt-out, as in the Danish case, with regard to certain matters. However, the European Union will not work that way, as very quickly each country will decide to cherry-pick and opt-out of any issues in which it does not want to be involved. That would lead to the Union falling apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Deputies Jim O'Keeffe, Quinn and McDowell on the reference to one of the thorny issues dealt with in the recent referendum <Col N="98" /> debate, European defence and security. There may be a notion in some parts of Ireland and Europe that this could be a possible opt-out area but we know it is not. Those with the original vision of the Europe that is now emerging envisaged that each country would contribute in one way or other and, as a result of that, there would be a return in terms of benefit to that country and to the Union at large. That was what the founding fathers wanted. They were inspired by the dire circumstances in which Europe then found itself. I was amazed during a debate on the Nice treaty just before the referendum when a person put forward as a reason to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; the thousands of Irish people killed in the two World Wars. That had nothing to do with the Nice treaty but it implied that as a result of voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Irish people would be conscripted into foreign armies and slaughtered all over the world, which was the expression used. This is where misinformation, peddled without authority, has done great damage to the European project. The sooner this Government and others throughout the Union recognise this problem and address it the better. If it is not addressed, from what I have seen of the internal workings of the European Union there are serious difficulties ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the kind of Europe we have. We should ask ourselves about the kind of Europe we want as we must determine that in the shortest possible time. When we do that we cannot back away. We have to sell it and pursue it and let people we know we are in favour of it. We must encourage and facilitate the debate that is necessary if we are to achieve the consensus we want. If we welch on that or shirk from our responsibilities then Europe will be stranded and becalmed, which would be a great tragedy. Some believe that the way we were was a better way, and that old traditions and living in isolation were best. We were independent and could survive alone, but that is no longer the case. We used to export our population in those times. The majority of our people had to seek a living abroad and we imported most of our consumer goods. There is a dramatic beneficial difference between the way we were and the way we are. The way we are is vastly better. We must sell that message to the electorate.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was talking about the need to ensure the integrity and security both of registration and the voting system. In the Bill provision is made for voters to opt not to have their names made available from the register without their knowledge. The register is edited to omit the names of those who do not <Col N="99" /> want them included. It seems to be an expensive and cumbersome procedure. I am aware that the Government looked at the option of making it illegal to use the data on the register and I am surprised that it is not the option excercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>It would have been cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect so. The debate appears to have gone ahead without consideration or examination of the possibility of compulsory voting. Such compulsion is the case in a number of jurisdictions and appears to work well. Perhaps we have reached the stage when citizens should be told that they have a civic duty to vote and participate in our democracy. It is a great pastime to find fault with the system and the individuals trying to work it, while not participating in what is a relatively simple and inexpensive exercise for a great many. It is an option that needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for a large printed copy of the voting paper to be provided in polling stations. I suggest that rather than having it in a prominent position in the polling station, which I understand is provided for in the Bill, it would be better to have it attached to the screen adjacent to where the person is voting, or right beside them. Those who have difficulty seeing the ballot paper would have it close by. That would be more sensible.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a substantial increase in spending limits. I have always argued, generally unsuccessfully, that we would fare better if we looked at the option of reducing expenditure rather than increasing limits. We have all received representations from the local radio sector because electoral advertising on local radio has been illegal up to now. It is unfair that a sector in competition with newspapers and others should be excluded from what is a lucrative form of advertising for the limited period of an election campaign. It would be better if newspaper advertising were prohibited. A large tranche of the cost for political parties at national level would then be removed. This feeling is increased by my belief that there is little benefit to candidates at local level from the advertising undertaken at national level by political parties.</P>
      <P>There is also a serious question over postering and the consequent littering of the countryside for an extended period. In an era of electronic communication, it should not be necessary to have this level of postering at huge expense. An advantage of the expenditure reduction approach, as opposed to the limits approach, is that it is far easier to police. It is all very well to have expenditure limits but I am not convinced that they can be effectively policed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition Members say that we are to have the election in October. However, if that does not happen, there is a long period from November to Easter when it will be known that there has to be an election in May or June. My understanding is <Col N="100" /> that people can spend what they want during that period, up to the day that the election is called. In an election year, where that election is clearly signalled, there will be enormous pressure on candidates and parties to spend a lot of money during the period outside the time covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are also issues which have not been properly dealt with concerning the level of support for Oireachtas Members who are Dáil candidates. These include Oireachtas envelopes, Dáil offices and telephones, secretarial assistance etc. There are two elements to this: whether this assistance will be allowed and, if so, whether it will constitute an election expense. Members should be allowed to use the facilities of the House and anything ancillary arising from their work as a Senator or Deputy. However, justice demands that this be counted as election expenditure.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Since it was published some months ago, the Labour Party has made a meal out of it. There have been times in the last two months when it seemed to have no policy other than to rant and rave about the Bill, and to try to link Fianna Fáil and other parties with big business.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The limits on donations of £500 and £4,000 were reasonable. Those rules have not let us down, yet we seem to be panicking. Once disclosure was a necessary part of the process, the system has worked reasonably. Moving towards a politically correct postion, and changing the ground rules before they have been given an opportunity to prove themselves is premature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Party spending in constituencies was set too low. I prefer the system that applied in the local elections when we could see what our running mates were spending. The best policing is that by individual candidates who can see what is being spent on the ground. I am not happy with the operation of this. The Public Offices Commission has been too fussy. From some stories I have heard about by-elections, the commission seems to be running around like a secret police organisation with its private investigators checking how many posters and leaflets a candidate has. It seems to be in conflict with the legislation. It interprets matters contrary to the spirit of the legislation and in a way that the Minister of the <Col N="101" /> day did not interpret them when the Bill was passed. I am not happy with these developments.</P>
    <P>Parties need resources and will have to get them, whether from the taxpayer or elsewhere. There are many other ways of acquiring funds. The Labour Party gets funding from trade unions. As an ex-trade union activist, I am aware that there are several different ways of funding candidates. Membership fees, capitation fees, individual grants, union affiliation fees, political funds &ndash; to which I always contributed my few pence &ndash; donations, special levies, strike fund surpluses and other funds can be included. As an active trade unionist, there were all sorts of funds available. Different money was paid out.</P>
    <P>When details came to light after the 1997 election, it emerged that the largest donation given by the union with which I was involved was to an old colleague of mine and a party colleague of Deputy Howlin, Deputy Seán Ryan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was well invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not in 1997. I believe Deputy Ryan received the largest donation from the union on three occasions &ndash; in the 1997 election campaign, in the Seanad election campaign and during the ensuing Dáil by-election campaign. The union must be almost broke and its political fund will remain low for an extended period.</P>
      <P>Parties will have to be allowed to seek funding in other ways. In my opinion we are going too far too soon. With regard to corporate donations, there are a number of large companies which I will not name which include in their public accounts sums of £100,000 or £200,000 and these are divided between the parties on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. I see no difficulty with that and we would be foolish to refuse to accept such donations. If companies wish to make donations and include them in their public accounts or their annual accounts, that is harmless. No one is ever going to come looking for favours in such a scenario.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal now with the establishment of special accounts into which the maximum donation to be lodged in a year will be £100. What will be the position for people who will be reliant on such accounts for funding? How long must the money be left in the account? Could they lodge it in the morning and withdraw it that evening or will they obliged to leave it in and produce their account book to the Public Offices Commission once a year? We are going from one extreme to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision relating to the amounts of £20,000, £25,000 and £30,000 for local spending. The amounts for such spending were ridiculously low in 1997 and, in fact, they are still too low. I say this and acknowledge the fact that I am not the biggest spender around. The proportion by which they have been increased is out of sync. In my opinion, the largest increase should have been for three seater constituencies because the first brochure or poster a candidate produces <Col N="102" /> is always the most expensive. I suppose the figures were rounded off to the nearest even amount which is understandable. However, a sum of £20,000 is no big deal. During each election campaign I have tried to compete with Labour, Independent Labour, the now defunct Democratic Left and Fine Gael, but if Members had seen my posters they would probably have given me money because they were miserable compared to those produced for several of my colleagues from other parties. It is rather amusing to hear representatives from these parties rant and rave about the amount of money we spend. That is a lot of nonsense and I do not know if they are fooling anyone.</P>
    <P>I would not know corporate funding if I saw it and I do not want any corporate donations. All I want to do is spend my own money on promoting myself to my constituents for re-election. It is stated that party head offices will take 50% of the £20,000 allocation. Representatives in Dublin constituencies spend more than £10,000 on an election campaign and anyone who tries to pretend otherwise is only fooling themselves. However, I believe they are not fooling themselves because they are aware of the facts. In my opinion, we are going to revisit the referendum, the McKenna judgment, etc., in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>People promote themselves in different ways. I may do it in terms of distributing leaflets, brochures, newsletters and so on, while others may do so by appearing in a regular slot on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; or &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. If I am going to be measured and controlled in relation to how I advertise myself, we will be obliged to introduce a further law which regulates access to the airwaves and to TV channels, not just during the three weeks of an election campaign but at all times. A member of a small party can appear on radio or television a couple of times each day or at least once a week and build up a national profile. However, a backbencher in one of the larger parties cannot and is not given the opportunity to operate in that way. If I am to be restricted and will only be allowed to spend a certain amount of money promoting myself, it would be only fair and just to impose restrictions on the representatives of smaller parties in my constituency or any other constituency. These representatives' access to the airwaves, their ability to table priority questions or whatever other methods they use to attract publicity ought to be measured. It is unfair that backbenchers from the larger parties are being held back and that the opportunities to garner publicity to which I refer are not open to them. We have gone hell for leather in one direction and that approach is not fair, it is not just and, in my opinion, it is a cod.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of provisions in the Bill. I am glad people will not be obliged to throw posters from previous elections on the fire. In addition, I welcome the U-turn made by the Public Offices Commission and also the clause relating to recycling. These measures will help to <Col N="103" /> make the figures to which I referred earlier more realistic. I suppose we will just have to learn to operate within the limits imposed by the £20,000 cap.</P>
    <P>Every law we pass must be enforced. We have all heard stories about inspectors running around during by-elections. If the State has spare money to spend on policing resources, it should be divided equally and spent on enforcing all our laws. The existing Act is not the most important law of the land and the level of resources spent on it is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I have one major concern about the future. Advertising campaigns will continue to be used by people in the future, but these will become increasingly negative in nature. Such campaigns will be carried out by people who will not register. There is evidence that this is already happening. For example, community groups, etc., are publishing newsletters and leaflets which are extremely political in tone. However, one will never be able to find the members of such groups and oblige them to register because they do not exist. Reference was made to the Ballymun Residents' Association. However, there could also be the Ballymun residents, the Ballymun project group, etc., and one would never find the members of such groups. Many of these groups are using State money, but that is beside the point. In the future these people, who will not register or include their names on brochures, will engage in huge advertising campaigns which will be negative in nature.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the amounts for spending are being increased slightly because this will help to restore a degree of balance to a system that was in danger of being completely screwed up. One will not be able to identify those responsible for the campaigns to which I refer. It must be recognised that even colleagues in this House &ndash; I refer to Members on all sides &ndash; are constantly finding new ways of circumventing the provisions in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this item of electoral legislation. I had the privilege to steer the last significant electoral law, the 1997 Act, through the Houses, which was an interesting experience. I will share some of my memories of that period with the House during the course of my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not expect to agree with very much, if anything, Deputy Noel Ahern had to say about an electoral law of this nature. However, I was pleasantly surprised that I found something with which I could agree. I refer in particular to the Deputy's closing comments about the way community groups and free sheets are evolving. I am concerned that there is a strong political involvement in some of the free sheets that are appearing across the country. Everyone knows that there is one political party here that is extremely well funded by sources from outside the State and it appears to have a number of new offices, full-<Col N="104" /> time workers and publishing organs which are not named after the party but which are selling its message. If we are intent on reforming electoral law, we will be obliged to address that issue. To that extent, there is something to what Deputy Ahern said.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a number of issues. Electoral law is critical to the conduct of our democracy. It is the base frame within which we operate our democratic systems. Democracy is a fragile beast. Everyone takes it for granted, but the reality is that it exists in a minority of states throughout the world and that it is relatively rare, in as much as it is not a long established system of government. In terms of the universal franchise, it is around 100 years old. It is not immune from attack so we must constantly nurture, protect and defend it.</P>
    <P>It is important that a national assembly like ours periodically returns to electoral law. Many issues arise. Access to the right to vote is a big one. Those of us who knocked on doors in Tipperary South recently know that some people find it impossible to exercise the vote because they are away on holiday or, like one elderly woman to whom I spoke in Cashel, find it physically difficult to get into the polling station. She finds it difficult to get up the steps but does not want to apply for a postal vote as she wants to be there in person. We must be more innovative in the way we allow people to participate in our democracy. The electronic advances in allowing people to purchase over the Internet or by telephone points the way that we should follow. We must engage with people to make the discharge of the right, the privilege, to vote as easy and accessible as possible.</P>
    <P>Allied to that is the responsibility to get the register of electors right. In the last referendum in my own constituency, the presiding officers had lists of people who were dead since the last election, or who had moved. There is no absolute imperative to get an accurate register. We draw conclusions from inaccurate registers after every election and referendum. It may be that 10% are dead, moved on, or absent and so conclusions about turn-out and participation rates are made from inaccurate figures. We do not put as much care in the drafting of the register as in other issues. In drafting a list to whom we will pay social welfare, we are very careful. I was going to say also benefits from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, but after recent revelations about sheep in County Louth I will not. By and large, where there are payments from public expenditure, one expects carefully drawn up lists. We are tardy about the most valuable thing we give people, the right to vote, to determine the membership of this House, to elect a Government and decide on the nature of politics. Disability rights is a big issue. As Minister, I accepted and enhanced a private member's Bill, introduced by the current Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which gave additional rights to people <Col N="105" /> physically challenged but we have not gone far enough.</P>
    <P>All those issues and the type of voting we have are of fundamental importance and require more than a periodic outing in this House. When there is a legislative proposal, Members throw out their own ideas, but there is no forum on democracy to discuss how we can make our decision making and voting processes as inclusive as possible. We must be more proactive in addressing our voting mechanisms, the drafting of the register, getting our messages across, etc. That is evolving as is the public attitude to the conduct of politics itself. The evolution of public opinion stems from the ongoing nightly revelations on television from tribunals. These have been the backdrop to political life for years.</P>
    <P>An inescapable issue on foot of these revelations is the funding of politics, political parties and campaigns. I introduced the 1997 Act with many objectives. One was transparency in the funding of political parties so that any significant contribution to an individual or a party would be declarable. Another was to have thresholds on expenditure in public campaigns to equalise the battle so that big money would not roll over those with lesser resources. That was extremely important. Then there was not the same consensus on banning corporate donations. On foot of recent revelations from the tribunals, the unanswerable issue is that the unsavoury connection between business and power must be addressed. Labour's promise is simple. If we cannot convince this Administration to abolish this connection by banning corporate donations, then we will make breaking it a condition when we negotiate to form a Government. Funding of politics is at the core of the debate. The Government parties danced around it for years because they are unwilling to make the break.</P>
    <P>I suspect that in the run up to the general election Fianna Fáil's coffers are lined, that the treasury is in place. They want to raise the expenditure limits to allow them to spend an extra £1 million on their campaign to buy the election. That is grossly unfair. This Bill had a tortuous trail. Fianna Fáil balanced the unanswerable public demand for an end to the interaction between business and politics with the party's demand for money. The balance favoured party over people. There is the prospect of that party's spending £3 million in the coming election, an increase of £1 million over what was allowed in the 1997 Bill that I steered through this House. Many stated in this debate that the 1997 Act was never tested in a general election. I could say why because it was a long process to get it through. It was tested in six by-elections during the course of this Dáil. It is proven to be fair and allowed people to fight on an even field. We are learning and refining as we go. Those limits were seen to be fair and reasonable and did away with much gimmickry. They were good in themselves as is proven by the conduct and results of the by-elections.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Progressive Democrats and <Col N="106" /> Fianna Fáil to my Bill was ironic. The current Attorney General was then the Progressive Democrats' spokesperson on the Environment. The Minister's officials can find chapter and verse on this in the Official Report. He fought it line by line, section by section. He claimed that the proposals were unconstitutional. Such is the legal advice of the current Attorney General. He believed that it was unconstitutional and so bad as to be unamendable. He fought it on that basis. In fairness, Deputy Dempsey, then the Opposition spokesperson, was less trenchant but they were both negative. Since I negotiated with both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in relation to these matters in two programmes for Government I can say that there was no great enthusiasm on the part of either in relation to the enactment of these measures. Both told us frankly that they had substantial debts to be met and needed time to recharge their exhausted treasuries. They were very slow to agree to the measures we wanted and agreement took a very long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, says that the new limits apply to all and therefore, by definition, because they apply to all, are fair. That is a perversion of truth. The reality is that they will be fair and equal if everybody has equal access to money. Every individual contesting an election and every political party does not have equal access to money. If one has a supporter with deep pockets, then one has access to money and will spend up to the exorbitantly increased new limits. However, if one is dependent on the small contributions of poor people, then there is no way one can compete. That is what makes it fundamentally unfair. It breaches the spirit I thought surrounded the mature reflection of all parties in the House on the contents of the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>I thought we had actually converted Fianna Fáil. Some months ago when I switched onto the Fianna Fáil website I discovered that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claimed the 1997 Electoral Act for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Not only does Fianna Fáil want the history of its opposition airbrushed from history but it actually wants to claim ownership of the measure itself.</P>
    <P>Important measures contained in the 1997 Act were not only expenditure limits but transparency on what was spent and who donated it. After the tortuous trail I have described of waiting month after month for the Government's proposals as they crystallised, evolved, changed and were debated we finally got the Minister's amendments in the Seanad. They limit corporate donations to £5,000 for a party and £2,000 for an individual. I acknowledge that is movement for Fianna Fáil. It is movement from the bland assertion of the former Attorney General, who I now understand is closer to Fianna Fáil than he was to the old Progressive Democrats, that it was an outrage to try to delimit the amount any individual citizen or corporate entity would give to politics and that it <Col N="107" /> was their absolute right to do as they wished with their money. Fianna Fáil has moved from that position, belatedly but significantly, to one where it believes in the principle of limits to corporate funding. The threshold figures of £5,000 and £2,000 are a start but I am sad that Fianna Fáil would not go the final step. That will happen, probably during the next Administration, and it will happen because the public demands it.</P>
    <P>There are other issues that arise in this legislation that I wish to refer to briefly. One of the principles we should try to have in the drafting of any law is to make it simple. With that principle in mind I refer to section 9 of the Bill. Can anybody reading it actually understand what it is about? It purports to be about supplements to the postal and special voters lists where more than one poll is held on the same day. It reads:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (4) of section 15A or subsection (4) of section 15B, where an application by an elector to have his name entered in the supplement to the postal voters list or the supplement to the special voters list is received after the relevant date referred to in subsection (4) of section 15A or subsection (4) of section 15B in relation to an election or a referendum but before the relevant date referred to in either of the said subsections in relation to another election or referendum, the poll at which is to be held on the same day, the relevant date for the second or subsequent election or referendum shall apply to an application received under subsection (4) of section 15A or subsection (4) of section 15B in connection with the elections or referendums.</P>
    <P>That sounds Greek. Let us try to write Bills in a way that is understandable. This is a measure that is supposed to allow access to vote. It is not impossible to write it in a way that is not as impenetrable as the Bill is.</P>
    <P>The ballot paper is another issue dealt with in the legislation. There are a number of things we need to do. We need to make it as accessible as possible and there should be large print. The last referendum was a disaster with small print on a small page in two languages. The result was confusion. It is good that there will be photographs and party emblems on the ballot paper but there should be clarity. I look forward to seeing some of the photographs as I know from some colleagues that they will use their confirmation photographs. It will be interesting to see whether the public recognise the candidate at all.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the notion of going back to the placing of posters outside polling stations, although I realise that only one per candidate will be allowed. In Fianna Fáil with multiple candidates will individuals have one each and be jostling for position? The ban on posters prevented hassle to people entering polling stations and was a good idea. There should be however a much larger polling station sign outside stations. I do <Col N="108" /> not know if there is a defined size but they vary considerably throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to have said something about electronic voting but will keep my powder dry in deference to the time factor. I promised Deputy Joe Higgins who had to leave earlier that I would raise a point that should be considered. Some of us contribute to our own election funding and carry our own debts with us. Deputy Higgins contributed something like £12,000 of his own money to his election campaign. If we are a party member, we will be debarred by this proposal from paying our own bills. If we make a donation of £5,000 to our party, that will be the limit. That is something at which we need to look.</P>
    <P>There is much debate required on the whole way in which we conduct elections and fund and deal with politics. I hope we will have more time during this debate and on Committee Stage and that we will establish some sort of forum on democracy to bring more people into the system to ensure our voting record increases and that our systems are in tune with the needs of the people at this the start of the 21st century.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill for a number of reasons. I would like to see us examine electoral legislation on a more regular basis rather than when difficulties arise or when the electorate shows a lack of interest in the voting process. Recently I visited a school in my constituency for a talk on the political process and was astounded at the lack of interest in a class of 40 students. Their lack of interest was due to the fact that politicians themselves showed little interest in students' lives and they felt politicians were removed from them. It is important that we try to address part of this in the Bill. While funding and donations is the dominant topic in this debate there are other relevant issues, and it is timely to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it deals with issues relevant to politicians and the public, especially the growing numbers not interested in voting. Although the occurrences of the past few months and years may have acted as deterrents to an interest in voting and politics by virtue of the quite proper coverage of tribunals, it is important that we, as practising politicians, attempt to reduce the difficulties encountered by voters. The political system must be made accessible and transparent and we must recognise the changing pattern of voting demographics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, like everyone interested in politics, knows that interest in the electoral system is diminishing each year. At each election we see a further reduction in the turnout. It is alarming that we are arriving at a point where it is less than 50%. I recognise the importance of making voting easy for people, especially those who are less lit<Col N="109" /> erate, by having photographs and names in larger print. It is simple to do that and it is relevant. Voting can be a concern for those who do not regularly read and write. We have spoken about addressing this matter for some time and, regrettably, it has taken until now to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We should carry out regular checks of the operational procedures of registration and voting. Will the Minister or an Oireachtas committee review on a regular, perhaps two-yearly, basis the success of a particular Electoral Act to ensure that obstacles for the electorate are removed? We need to check frequently if there are new reasons for a low turnout. Unlike the past, family commitments can often be a deterrent to voting, particularly if both partners are working outside their constituency. I welcome the proposals that recognise this.</P>
    <P>The registration process revises the condition for the registration of political parties and endeavours to improve the electoral process. That is fundamental to this Bill. I am happy that the Bill forms an important part of the Government's programme to reform the regulatory framework of public life. That is a significant ambition. It deals clearly with the acceptance and disclosure of public donations and the financing of political parties. There are a number of ways we can entice people to vote, some being quite simple. We must target groups to ascertain why they are not voting and then deal with the problem in so far as this is possible.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the Bill were about compelling people to vote in the first instance. I find it difficult to reconcile the fact that so many people write to us in favour of Irish people abroad voting here and yet, as we grow more affluent, the interest in the political system declines. In the future, I hope we can ensure that people are mandated and that they are legally obliged to participate in the voting process, even if it is necessary to allow those who merely want to make comments on their ballot papers to do so. In some jurisdictions, there is a special column to allow for criticism of the process or those who represent it. This must be examined. Recently, I read that the Greek Government funds voting by way of encouraging emigrants to return home to vote, even going to the extent of paying for air fares. As generous as this Government is, I do not expect it to do that. However, it shows that there is a commitment abroad to increasing the turnout at elections but, unfortunately, it does not obtain here. It is ironic that pressure should be mounting on us to help people who are abroad to vote.</P>
    <P>The system should be made more user-friendly and I welcome the provisions that begin this process. I welcome the change concerning the register of voters, specifically the edited register. I also recognise that representations have been made to various Ministers over the past number of years to ensure that voters are protected from receiving junk mail. I see the need for this, and it shows <Col N="110" /> that the Minister and his colleagues have been listening to representations.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is very important. It enables the creation of a national register of electors required for the future development of electronic, internet or telephone voting. This will facilitate on-line updating of the different registers of electors nationwide. The Bill is far-reaching in this regard. Section 6 makes two worthwhile changes. The first provides that people on the register of electors who move from one constituency or local electoral area to another can apply for entry onto the register at their new address provided they forfeit their right to vote at their previous one. This might not seem important but it has been an issue for years and is only now being addressed. Often people who change address find that they are not on the appropriate register as an election approaches.</P>
    <P>I understand the frustration of Opposition speakers because the Government will not accept every proposal they make. Deputy Howlin mentioned 1997 but that was a different time. We are now part of a new regime that has recognised the huge demand of the public to ensure that the voting process is transparent. Unfortunately, the issue that clouds that transparency is money and the perception that politicians are in politics only for the salary. Although it may have taken time, the Government is aware that public disinterest is partly due to the possible tie between politics and money. In that regard, I welcome the Bill's limits on three, four and five-seater constituencies. It makes clear to the public that there are limits on expenditure. It has been suggested that Government and Opposition parties will be able to spend £100,000 or £200,000 in a five seat constituency like my own. It is fair that I point out that my party's expenditure will be about one fifth of that figure, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil will run four candidates in Laoighis-Offaly.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude, as I have agreed to share time with my colleague, Deputy Callely. I commend the Bill and welcome its provisions. It deals with so many issues that I have not had time to deal with some of them, including electronic voting, which I welcome as the public has demanded it. I am glad to note that electronic voting will only survive if it is supported on both sides of the House. Moves are being made to ensure such support for a measure which will ensure the electorate becomes more involved and that tallymen will have an easier time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. I concur with most of Deputy Moloney's comments regarding the use of incentives to encourage people to vote. I am not sure if I am prepared to go to the lengths suggested by him, but believe that the disappointing downward trend in polling in recent years can be reversed. An improvement will be seen if appropriate incentives are put in place. I am not sure paying people to vote would be the right approach, although it could be argued they <Col N="111" /> would not be paid to vote in any direction, but merely to vote.</P>
      <P>Whenever I come across people who express apathy or disenchantment and indicate that they do not intend to vote, I encourage them to go the polling station to make use of their democratic right. I point out to them that the ballot paper can be used to signal whatever strong views they may have or whatever message they may wish to convey. Appropriate incentives should be put in place and there are many we can consider, such as a tax allowance for those in the tax net. We could make it more difficult for those who have not voted over a period of time to be placed on the register of electors. We could put a structure in place in order that if the opportunity to vote has not been taken on three, four or five occasions, those involved will have to go through another procedure to get back on the register.</P>
      <P>Equally, I strongly believe that more than incentives are required. As other speakers have done, I acknowledge that the revelations that have been heard at tribunals in recent months and years have been disappointing, and there are probably more to come. It is easy to tar everyone with the same brush, but only a handful of politicians have been before tribunals. There are 166 Members in this House, and if one considers the turnover at each election, only a handful of those who have passed through this House in the last 20 years are involved and will pay the price. They have given all politicians a bad name.</P>
      <P>I am sometimes amused by what one sees, hears and reads about what happens in a multi-seat constituency. All Members of the House have witnessed the phenomenon to which I refer. As we approach a general election, it becomes more apparent that those from other parties in one's constituency are standing on soapboxes listing what they will implement if returned to power. If they attend a meeting about education, they will make promises about educational matters. If they are speaking to a health forum, they will talk about what they will do regarding health. Such behaviour is partly responsible for the disappointing downward trend in voter turnout and highlights the hypocrisy of those who spout the music appropriate to an audience's ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voters are likely to tar all politicians with the same brush when they hear them say that they will implement a minor matter, but one that is crucial for an individual voter. Politicians who engage in this practice, if elected to power, often say that although the promise was in their party's manifesto, it cannot be delivered on in the programme for Government as their new Government partners do not agree. Such behaviour is very disappointing. The electorate has a role to play, too, as this problem is not just the fault of those trying to get elected who promise things impossible to deliver and say things appropriate to the wishes of the audience. If a party is elected, voters should be clear about what they have done <Col N="112" /> and should vote for the party which will deliver what it promised in its manifesto.</P>
    <P>I am sickened when I hear people saying what they think is appropriate to their audience. Most political parties have had the opportunity to deliver in government and for one reason or another have failed to do so. This phenomenon is not confined to members of political parties, as many Independent Members of this House have behaved in a similar manner over a prolonged number of years and we know the consequences. I ask the Minister of State and his Department to take on board my initial point, that we should look at giving fair incentives to the electorate to vote, without purchasing or buying votes, as it may be interpreted.</P>
    <P>I disagree with comments that have been made regarding limits on corporate donations. It is wrong to limit corporate donations at the levels of £2,000 and £5,000 as suggested. I ask the Minister of State to outline the measures proposed for index-linking. Equally, I am concerned about the new limits on election expenditure of £20,000, £25,000 and £30,000, depending on one's constituency. I do not come from a political background and had to paddle my own canoe against high fliers when I joined my constituency's branch of my party. There are difficulties for those in multi-seat constituencies who enter as underdogs, as half their money goes to their political party. I regret I am out of time as I would like to comment further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Timmins and Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>. I welcome many aspects of the legislation but there are also gaps in it that need to be filled. A good electoral Bill would result in more people voting and our aim should be to ensure more people participate in the democratic process. It is more than two years since the last nationwide election, the 1999 local elections, when approximately 50% of the electorate voted. The turnout was less than 40% in certain electoral areas. I raised the appalling turnout for those elections a week or two afterwards with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, as did a number of other Members, and he promised he would extensively examine the issue and bring forward a range of measures to encourage more people to vote. Unfortunately, as has been the case with many of the Minister's proposals, nothing happened.</P>
      <P>I would like us to debate measures which would encourage people to participate in the democratic process but that is not what the legislation is about. This debate is similar to last week's debate on the Local Government Bill, 2000. The media and political debate on that Bill was taken up with one issue, namely the dual mandate, while the debate on this legislation has revolved around spending limits. There are also other aspects of it which need to be addressed. I am concerned we are doing very little to encourage and facilitate voter participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> There is a by-election later this week in Tipperary South. Most Members have been canvassing there. The constituency is no different from any other and it is apparent that fewer people wish to participate in the democratic process. Some Members have made suggestions as to how this problem should be tackled. Deputy Callely said he had to paddle his own canoe in his constituency but I am sure some of his party colleagues discovered he was using a powerboat. He pointed out there should be incentives to encourage people to vote, with which I agree. However, we must seriously examine the system of compulsory voting which is provided for in a number of jurisdictions in Europe. It is regrettable that we may have to consider compulsory voting. While participation in the democratic process is a right it is also a responsibility and there must be some sanction on those who totally ignore the democratic process.</P>
    <P>As a number of speakers said, an option could be given to voters to note their protest by providing space on the ballot paper for them to say they do not wish to support any of the candidates or parties. If other countries can successfully operate a system whereby 85% to 90% of the electorate votes, we should be able to do likewise. If we end up in a position similar to the US where less than 50% of the electorate votes regularly, it will be bad for democracy. This issue needs a forum, similar to that referred to by Deputy Howlin, to encourage widespread debate because our cherished democracy is at risk when less than 50% of the electorate participates in a national election.</P>
    <P>The provision of expenditure limits in the legislation is a cynical exercise designed to buy rather than win votes. It will not be effective and I hope, on mature reflection, over the next 12 months every party in the House will recognise that what is proposed by the Fine Gael Party, namely the abolition of corporate funding of politics, is the only reasonable and fair way to move forward. If we want to clean up politics and make it attractive for both candidates and the electorate, we could make a good start by banning corporate donations rather than changing expenditure limits as provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members do not have the expertise to debate much of the legislation introduced in the House but all of us have the necessary expertise to discuss this Bill. Deputy Callely mentioned that he wished to make other points while Deputy Bradford had to shorten his contribution and it is regrettable that we do not have more time to debate the Bill or that we did not have a period for discussion prior to its introduction. Reference has been made to the Committee Stage debate but we all know the Bill will be pushed through quickly. I regret the legislation is being rushed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callely's contribution was interesting and he made an important point. He said he had to paddle his own canoe while Deputy Bradford referred to him using a powerboat but I believe <Col N="114" /> Deputy Callely is probably involved with a cruise liner. He said corporate donations are not index linked and that is one of the greatest anomalies in the legislation. Members can spend any amount between elections. I could spend £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 promoting myself throughout the summer on the assumption that the general election will be held next October or in March 2001. If I have money, I will have a head start on other candidates and that is not the way our democratic system should operate.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have been widened to limit expenditure outside election campaigns. Fine Gael's proposal to ban corporate donations would address that issue because Members would not be able to generate enough money between elections to promote themselves to the extent that some do currently.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 deal with the polling schemes prepared by local authorities. Section 13 states: </P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Principal Act is amended by (a) the deletion of subsection (2) of &ldquo;be subject to the confirmation by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Does this mean the polling scheme will be accepted by the Minister or will he or she issue directives to local authorities pointing out that they should not provide polling stations where there are only 100, 200 or 300 electors? Polling stations in my constituency were closed for the vote on the Nice treaty referendum and people had to travel long distances to vote on the day.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for photographs on ballot papers. It states: &ldquo;The ballot paper may include a photograph of each candidate&rdquo;. Is it necessary for a candidate to provide a photograph or is it optional? Through no fault of politicians some photographs used by newspapers and so on are so out of date one would not recognise the individuals involved. If photographs are to be provided, perhaps it should be required that they should be taken within the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that ballot boxes with 50 or fewer ballot papers will be opened in view of the public but the secrecy of the ballot will be respected. However, tallymen will be able to see the ballot papers. There should be no tallymen but assuming electronic voting will not be introduced overnight manual counting will continue. There are people who believe politicians know how they vote. The returning officers should open the ballot boxes, count the votes and make the figure available because I am worried about the intimidation of electors. Tallymen and party activists should not be allowed into the count centres and they should not be allowed to hammer on doors on the day of voting because they intimidate voters.</P>
    <P>The expenditure limit of £30,000 for a candidate in a five seat constituency is too high. A circular was issued recently by radio stations which sought political advertising on local stations. I am a firm believer that we should ban newspaper advertising during an election campaign. We, as <Col N="115" /> politicians, get a lot of flak from the newspapers about fund raising. However, the majority of the money is spent on newspaper advertising during election time. I look forward to the Minister introducing an innovative amendment in this regard. We are castigated for holding golf classics or getting corporate donations, yet the newspapers want to take the money from us. It will be interesting to see what amount of money is spent by political parties and individuals during an election campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>)<b>:</b> I welcome the idea of having photographs on the ballot paper. When I came into the House as a rookie &ndash; I am probably still a rookie &ndash; I argued for this, but I was given the greatest gobbledegook of all time, namely, that the printers could not guarantee they would have proper photographs. I offered to get three or four printers in my county to produce perfect photographs without any difficulty. This issue arose for me when a husband I canvassed refused to vote. He had asked me about putting photographs on the ballot paper because his wife and daughter were illiterate and he did not want to embarrass them. I did my best then. Like the gestation of an elephant, I welcome this prodigy which has been produced by the midwife in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It took a long time but I claim some credit for it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the register is not a bible which does not allow one to step out of line without getting punished. People are left out by mistake or human error. I am glad that people can be added to it. I also welcome electronic voting. We live in a modern age and young people might be encouraged to vote to show off their skills on the computer system.</P>
      <P>I object to allowing people to put posters within 50 metres rather than 100 metres of a polling station. The posters will be closer than that because people will not be able to take long steps. The blood sport of allowing people to stand outside polling stations is all right for the public, but not for democracy. As a candidate, I would like to think that people can walk in without being intimidated. Allowing posters within 50 metres is too dodgy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not welcome the increased spending per candidate for an election, as Deputy Timmins said. I have argued for years that political parties are gullible. The increased rates for advertising will come into force for the elections. People who are not interested in politics will skip the advertisement in a newspaper. Only the die-hards in the main political parties will look at it and compare it with that for their own party and then say they did a better job. It is a waste of money to have a page or a half page of an advertisement in a newspaper unless it is a big photograph which someone might recognise. It is a total waste of money to advertise policy. Parties should save their money. Someone might see an advertise<Col N="116" /> ment on television by mistake because they cannot turn it off, but they will not read the advertisement in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand a Fianna Fáil Deputy talking about the historic day when contributions were stopped and corporate donations were abolished. Fine Gael has given the lead in banning corporate donations. If the public wants to stop corporate donations, it does not have an option but to allow politics to be funded by the State. This means people will not be under the thumb of others. A candidate is allowed a limit of £2,000 and a political party is allowed a limit of £5,000. If we want to make an effort to keep everything about board, surely £5,000 is too high for any party to get as a donation from the corporate sector. The argument that one cannot separate corporate donations from individual donations in a company does not stand up. If a company wants to give money, it should be seen to give it. I regret that I will not have my photograph on the ballot paper in the next election.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate on the Bill which, as would one expect, engaged the attention of Deputies more than most other Bills. Many interesting matters were raised and I will deal with as many as I can in the time available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new donation limits for political parties, elected members and third parties evoked a variety of responses. We had the arguments on the ban on corporate donations repeated, although those arguments do not stand up to any rigorous scrutiny. The position which pertained in the past and which may have led to the events being disclosed in Dublin Castle in connection with a few individuals no longer applies. The regulatory context in which we operate today is substantially different from a few years ago. The disclosure requirements now in operation would have highlighted or prevented some of the matters being investigated by the tribunals. Nobody condones such activity. We must learn from the past and the Government through this Bill and other Bills going through the Oireachtas at present will set in place a regime to provide an era of openness and accountability. The Public Offices Commission in its 1999 annual report stated that the &ldquo;Commission is satisfied that present practice in Ireland compares well with that in other countries and, indeed, many countries are at present looking to the Irish model with interest.&rdquo;  It is time for the Members of this House, who have had no involvement in the affairs being disclosed at Dublin Castle, to reclaim the high ground and, as Deputy Gilmore said, to stop talking down the political world. If we do not do it, how can we <Col N="117" /> expect others to do it? We must start getting our message across that there are positive aspects to political life in this country.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals in the Bill on limiting donations for political purposes will provide an open and transparent system for all. I noticed last Friday that Deputies Olivia Mitchell, Burke and Gilmore reluctantly and indirectly acknowledged that the Government had moved towards their parties' positions in the matter. I am convinced the public will agree that the Government's proposals are the proper way to go forward. Arguments about whether a cheque is a personal cheque or a business cheque are not the real issue; openness and accountability are the key determinants in this matter. This is particularly relevant in so far as Fine Gael is concerned. In its discussion document on the funding of political parties in May 2000, Fine Gael stated that it &ldquo;does not believe it is possible to distinguish between corporate and individual donations&rdquo;. The document also states that &ldquo;we believe that the source and size of a donation &ndash; corporate or individual &ndash; is more important than the legal status of the immediate donor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The party has not published, to my knowledge, the rationale for the total change in policy. What major developments have occurred in the past 12 months to cause such a fundamental change of direction? While respecting the Labour Party position, I am not aware that its policies are infallible and that it has absolute righteousness on its side. If so, why did the Labour Party not ban corporate donations in the now Electoral Act, 1997?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister of State not notice the changes? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard an explanation why it did not include such a provision in that Act. The Government, in the absence of co-operation from the other parties, has produce a sensible and operative scheme of donation limits which are reasonable for all concerned. The Government had to consider what limits would be reasonable having regard to the rights of free speech found in the Constitution and in the European Charter of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter which dominated contributions from the Opposition is the increase in election expenditure limits. The origin of the present disagreement goes back to 1997 when the Electoral Act, 1997, was debated in the Oireachtas. The Minister, who was then in Opposition, stated his opposition to the limits in the 1997 Act, especially when the then Minister refused to increase the limits set out in the Bill. The proposed new limits are in line with the amounts proposed by the Minister in 1997 and adjusted for inflation. I continue to be amazed at the position adopted by the Labour Party, namely, accept our proposals or else. It should be aware that there are other equally valid views than the ones it expresses. The expenditure limits in the 1997 Act are not immutable to change. <Col N="118" /> Deputy Gilmore's colleague, Deputy Howlin, the then Minister, said during the Committee Stage debate on the 1997 Act that &ldquo;the figures are not written in stone&rdquo;. Deputy Olivia Mitchell said a lot of thought was given to the limits in the 1997 Act. I wonder where such consideration was given, and whether she could point out where I might find it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore continued his argument that the new limits will increase Fianna Fáil expenditure by about £800,000 at the next general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody did a lot of research on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The limits are the same for every candidate. The only major determining factor is the overall number of candidates. There is nothing to stop any party nominating as many candidates as it wishes. I cannot understand the reason Fianna Fáil is being blamed for nominating a large number of candidates. Why does the Labour Party or Fine Gael not nominate as many candidates as Fianna Fáil? The choice of the number of candidates a party wishes to nominate is a fundamental right. Are the parties opposite suggesting that Fianna Fáil should nominate the same number of candidates as them in order that the expenditure will be the same? The arguments of the Opposition do not stand up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore made a very disingenuous remark that the increase of nearly £2 million for funding the running of political parties was equivalent to the loss of donation income by Fianna Fáil. That is totally untrue. The £2 million will be distributed to all parties which obtain over 2% of first preference votes at the last and future general elections on the basis of the proportion of such first preferences votes obtained by the party's candidates to the overall number of first preference votes received by qualified political parties.</P>
      <P>The Bill's provision for direct vote recording and electronic vote counting were also referred to in the debate. While accepting that some Deputies may have concerns about the introduction of a new system for voting and vote counting, I must dispel the notion suggested by some Deputies that the system could discourage the elderly from voting. On the contrary, experience in all countries shows that the elderly have no problem using the voting machine and favour it over the paper ballots. We found this was the case at the Dublin South Central by-election and I am sure that the demonstration of the voting machine at next Saturday's by-election in the Tipperary South constituency will get the same reaction. Deputies should withhold such comments until they see an actual demonstration of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore suggested that the proposed system is not modern. The voting machine and the software are based on current technology and best practice. The system proposed is not <Col N="119" /> intended as a fashion or style-based product. It is based on reliability, functionality and integrity. I do not know the basis of the Deputy's statement. Is it based on a possible system, as he suggested, such as a bank ATM, that one could vote from anywhere in the country or abroad? If so, the Deputy would need to do more research in the matter. His proposal to compare a voting system which may be used only once every few years with bank ATMs or the lottery machines is not realistic. The cost of such a system would be much higher than what is proposed and require extensive maintenance and logistical support. The system proposed is simple, requires minimum training for polling staff and the voter and relatively maintenance free. It is deliberately designed to use the existing ballot paper so as not to confuse voters. All the voter will have to do is to use finger pressure instead of a pencil for recording a preference.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the system referred to by Deputy Gilmore would present problems for the elderly, something which he incorrectly attributed to the proposed system. The system talked about by the Deputy would be more difficult to use as it would have to hold personal information on each elector. Apart from data protection matters, this would present much greater security problems not present in the proposed system. The elector would have to input some personal information into the machine in order for it to verify his or her eligibility and respond to prompts by the machine. In contrast, the proposed system will use the same format on the existing ballot papers with the addition of photographs and party logos. I have mentioned these facts as I want to rebut any notion that the system proposed will present any problems to the electorate, especially the elderly or that the system is not modern. The Government has agreed in principle to the system, subject to satisfactory testing. Needless to say, it will not agree to use the system if it is not totally satisfied as to its suitability to Irish electoral conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to the register of electors and its inaccuracies. The Bill provides a provision, subject to both Houses approving a ministerial order, to have the register prepared, maintained and published by an agency other than registration authorities. Many of the deficiencies referred to by Deputies can be overcome by registration authorities in its compilation, greater involvement by the public in checking that their names are included in it and perhaps by politicians and their political parties engaging in reviewing the draft register. If a person's name is omitted from the register, he or she can apply at any time of the year for entry in the supplement. It is not necessary to wait until an election or referendum is about to be called.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for some changes and supplements to the register to facilitate registration. Many Deputies suggested that child allowance records should be used to invite young people <Col N="120" /> reaching 18 years to apply for registration. The Department suggested this to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs but the latter indicated that it could not disclose such information under the Data Protection Act, as it was obtained for the purpose of administering social welfare services and other social supports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the deletion of names of permanent residents from the register of electors. This should not be happening as the Minister issued a statutory instruction under section 18 of the Electoral Act, 1992, in 1997 to registration authorities that they should write to people on the register before they delete their names from the draft register for the following year. The Minister will remind registration authorities of this matter before next year's draft is prepared.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton raised the question of third level students. The current law provides that students can use their home addresses or their away address for registration. They can also apply for a postal vote and the Department has provided an information leaflet for students in co-operation with USIT.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the lack of a provision in the Bill to reduce the age limit for standing for the Dáil. The Bill could not contain such a provision as a constitutional amendment would be required to reduce the age from 21 years. The Deputy also referred to a possible prohibition on publishing the results of opinion polls close to polling day. This is a subject which has implications for the constitutional right of free expression and also such a prohibition, if considered, may be pointless with access to the Internet.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to voter turnout. Regrettably, turnout has been decreasing in recent years. Unlike a small number of countries in Europe, voting is not compulsory here. Our system entitles an elector to vote; it also gives the elector the right not to vote at a particular poll. Various theories have been put forward for low voter turnout &ndash; choice of polling day and hours of polling; complexity of the subject and a lack of information; perception that a particular result is a foregone conclusion; no real choice; apathy, etc. The reality is that nobody can say with any degree of certainty what is the cause of a low turnout. It may be due to a single factor or a combination of factors.</P>
    <P>Research by the Referendum Commission following the referendums in 1998 suggested that lack of engagement in relation to the Amsterdam Treaty and a belief that the result of the Northern Ireland referendum was a foregone conclusion were among the reasons. Its research analysis of non-voters revealed a variety of reasons for not voting: 36% were too busy; 23% were away from home; 16% were not bothered; 8% were ill; and 14% did not have enough information, did not understand the issues or were unable to make up their minds.</P>
    <P>Low turnout is a shared responsibility by <Col N="121" /> elected Members, public authorities and the public. While there is some research ongoing concerning European elections, perhaps this matter might be appropriate for consideration by the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government at a future date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie referred to problems of personation at elections. Under electoral law, a presiding officer may of his or her own volition or, if so required by a personation agent, request any person applying for a ballot to satisfy himself or herself as to their identity by producing any one of a number of specified documents. Where a person fails to produce such a document, or the presiding <Col N="122" /> officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, a ballot paper is not issued. Presiding officers have powers to direct a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest a person where they have a reasonable cause to believe that personation is or has been committed. Electoral law also provides for the offence of personation and appropriate penalties. This matter is being reviewed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie also asked if a person who reaches 18 years between the date of polling and the last day for applying to get on the supplement to the register of electors will have their birthday noted on the register. This is not intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of raising this extremely important issue on the Adjournment. I realise that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is in Donegal and is not available to take the matter. I am glad, however, that her Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is here to respond to the debate.</P>
      <P>The issue of this year's funding for the County Wexford Enterprise Board is a very simple and straightforward one which I hope and expect will meet with a positive response. The cash budget available for this year which was notified recently to the board is £262,000. I will explain the figure in a straightforward manner because we can become bamboozled with figures. In the outstanding commitments from last year, and every year since the boards were established, it was understood that there was a carry over figure that had not been drawn down. The carry over figure is £197,884. The commitments for 2001 are £285,336 of which, to date, £22,116 has been paid out. That leaves a total liability for the board of £483,220, to be paid out before the year end. That is the board's estimated requirement for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cash budget notified to it by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is £262,000 so the shortfall for this year will amount to £221,220. This shortfall is on the basis that all applications currently on hand are simply frozen. Indeed, projects approved by the enterprise board's evaluation committee and valued at £75,500 have been frozen. Put simply, on the basis of the reduced allocation available to County Wexford Enterprise Board this year the board, <Col N="123" /><Col N="124" /> which is a limited company set up with the social partners acting at local level as volunteer members, is insolvent. There was great anger at the board meeting when that predicament was discovered. This is against the background of the recent closure of Wexal in Enniscorthy, the closure of Wexford Weaving, a significant company in Wexford town, and lay-offs in a number of companies across County Wexford. There is now an acknowledged crisis in Wexford, a point accepted by the Tánaiste in her response during a recent debate in this House following the closure of Wexford Weaving.</P>
    <P>It is simply not good enough for one of the successes in job creation, which has created some 800 to 900 jobs at an average cost of something less than £4,000 each, to be put in this position. I expect the Minister to assuage my annoyance and the annoyance and anger of the members of Wexford County Enterprise Board by stating that the shortfall will be addressed immediately and the small sum of money under discussion will be provided to ensure not only that the estimated shortfall on current projects is met but also that sufficient resources will be provided to the board immediately to allow them begin to tackle the unemployment crisis that exists in Wexford. Anything less will be met with disbelief and anger by the people of the county I represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, is unable to reply in this debate as he is attending a Council of research ministers in Luxembourg. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for managing the development of and overseeing the activities and financing for the 35 city and county enterprise boards throughout the country. The function of the boards is to assist the establishment and development of enterprises with ten or fewer employees. City and county enterprise boards derive considerable funding from the EU as they are co-financed under the Structural Funds. The exact mechanism is the micro-enterprise sub-measures of the local enterprise development sub-programme of the Border, midlands and western and the southern and eastern operational programmes of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department believes that in order to support micro-enterprises in the most effective way it is vital that the needs of all who utilise the boards' services are kept under constant review. The boards and the Department have been pursuing a policy of changing the emphasis. It is clear that repayment of cash grants, including repayment of funding, is most effective only when all the other supports which enable micro-enterprises to survive and prosper are also in place. For this reason, the boards, with the encouragement of the Department, have been concentrating more on the provision of what are called the soft sup<Col N="125" /> ports, which include advice, mentoring and management development, in building the capability of micro-enterprises.</P>
    <P>In relation to the policy on grants, there has been increasing recourse to repayable forms of assistance which include equity and refundable grants. Priority is given to projects with the greatest potential to develop into strong export entities. The CEBs have also a very important role in the area of helping develop and maintain an enterprise culture and as well are playing a central role in the development and delivery of enterprise education modules aimed at all levels of education.</P>
    <P>The Department advises each board annually of its grant capacity for that year. This is the number of grants it may authorise in the year. It also authorises a cash capacity which is the amount of money estimated as necessary to meet the entire draw down of cash required in that year. The Wexford board has alerted the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the reduced cash allocation, which was made this year, may be insufficient to meet its commitments. All boards received reduced cash allocations this year based on the total funding available to the Department to meet the needs of CEBs.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department are in close contact with the board in order to establish the exact position and to consider the options available. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, assures everyone that no commitment properly entered into by a board will be left unpaid. It is the firm intention of the Government that over the period of the national plan the CEBs will continue to play a vital role in the economic development of the State. He can foresee, however, a different approach being necessary. There will be much more use of refundable aid and the importance of capability and development &ndash; advice, mentoring, training etc. &ndash; will increase enormously. One of the main roles of CEBs will be the actions aimed at the development of an enterprise culture and the development and delivery of enterprise education in primary, secondary and third level education.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Insurance Company Liquidation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this very serious and potentially hugely damaging matter for Irish companies. It is unfortunate that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not here but I recognise she was in Donegal today and could not make it back in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 June a provisional liquidator was appointed to the British company, Independent Insurance Limited. The collapse of Independent Insurance will clearly have a serious impact on the insurance industry in Ireland as there are many clients here with extensive insurance cover from the company. Independent Insurance has <Col N="126" /> been operating in the Republic for approximately three years. Initial operations were directed from Britain but since last February the company operated an Irish branch.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the company primarily provided insurance cover to commercial clients and some high net worth individuals. Its main business is understood to be employers' liability insurance and it has insured a number of very large companies, some of which are involved in the construction sector. It appears most of the insurance cover was provided through insurance brokers and in recent days brokers across the country have been desperately trying to reorganise insurance cover for firms with cover from Independent Insurance as claims payments from that company can no longer be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The company has reported premium income of £30 million for this year in Ireland and the figure is possibly higher. The serious threat to Irish companies lies in the fact that, unlike companies in the UK, commercial companies here are not covered by the UK policy-holders' protection board if the insurer is liquidated over claims that cannot be met by the insurer. This is because employers' liability insurance is not compulsory here.</P>
    <P>The liquidation of the Independent Insurance group has a number of potentially serious consequences for Irish businesses and employment. There is the obvious loss of between 30 and 50 jobs among Independent Insurance staff in Dublin as well as the potential loss to companies that have paid premiums to Independent Insurance this year because they cannot be sure of being reimbursed for the second half of this year. The third, and by far most serious, potential consequence relates to whether claims submitted by, or due to, Irish companies will be honoured by the company.</P>
    <P>To give an example of a potential crisis for a company, there are a number of potentially large compensation claims involving construction companies due before Irish courts shortly. The costs of these claims may have to be borne by the employers because insurance cover may not be met. The liquidation process being undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers will take months at least as the process is a complicated one that involves huge assets and liabilities. Estimated assets are £1.7 billion and estimated liabilities are £1.4 billion. The liquidation process covers about six countries. Quite simply, there are many companies that cannot afford to bear the cost of insurance claims and stay in business. Cases exist which could potentially force, for example, contractors to bear the cost of claims incurred by subcontractors who were insured by independent insurance.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to intervene and offer support to businesses which find themselves under a huge financial burden, through no fault of their own, because an insurance group is going into liquidation in the United Kingdom. As I pointed out, companies in the United Kingdom are not in the same position as companies in Ireland and the Small Firms Association has warned that problems of finding competitively <Col N="127" /> priced alternative cover and the cost of potential payouts on claims could close Irish firms. I look forward to a positive response. There is a precedent for this in the 1980s. In press cuttings the Tánaiste says she has considered this and I hope she will be generous to firms which may go under if she is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has asked me to apologise to the Deputy for her absence this evening. He has graciously acknowledged that she is in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Independent Insurance ceased writing new business on 14 June and PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed as liquidator on 18 June. Under the rules of the European Single Market, responsibility for financial supervision of the company's operations throughout the European economic area lies with the UK authorities. The main objective of the EU system of financial supervision of insurance companies is to protect policyholders while giving them access to insurance cover from supervised companies in all European economic area member states. As a result of contacts with the Irish Brokers Association and the liquidator, it is understood Independent Insurance insured a number of companies for public and employers' liability. The company also provided cover for motorcyclists through Carol Nash brokers. The treatment of policyholders as creditors of a failed insurer is determined by the laws of the &ldquo;home&rdquo; member state, in this case, the United Kingdom. UK insolvency law treats all policyholders as unsecured creditors. It will not be clear for some time the extent to which the liquidator of Independent Insurance will be able to meet claims from the creditors of Independent Insurance, including policyholders, though it appears likely that claims will not be met in full.</P>
      <P>The UK Policyholder Protection Act provides, subject to certain limitations, that compensation should be paid to individual policyholders in the event of a company failure. Corporate policyholders are compensated only in respect of compulsory insurance. Departmental officials are seeking to clarify whether any policies issued to Irish policyholders will meet the qualifying criteria for protection. The Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprises, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, have been following developments closely with particular focus on the immediate implications for Irish policyholders and claimants. We are also concerned at the broader implications for the effective operation of the European single market in insurance. Contact is being maintained with the UK authorities and the European Commission, as well as with the provisional liquidator, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Irish Brokers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has met representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation to address the immediate consequences of the company's collapse. The members of the IIF have been endeavouring to facilitate Independent Insurance policyholders obtain alternative cover. <Col N="128" /> Ministers will continue to address the consequences of the Independent Insurance liquidation, including the broader implications for the protection of policyholders within the European single insurance market. I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy. He is in Luxembourg at a Council meeting.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Garda Complaints Board.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1986 Act which established the Garda Complaints Board requires the annual reports of the board to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, should explain the reason he illegally suppressed the report of the board for 1999 for a period of six months after it was received by him. The report, which contains unprecedented criticism of the failure of the Minister and the Government to radically reform the statutory provisions which govern the workings of the board, was received by the Minister in December 2000 and not published until Thursday last. Under the legislation applicable to the board, the report should have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and published many months ago.</P>
      <P>In its report the board states its need for an independent investigative structure and acknowledges that because it is incapable of determining within a reasonable timeframe allegations of garda misconduct, the general public has lost confidence in it. The board emphasises the urgency for the Government to resolve the difficulties being experienced by it. For two and a half years the Government has been aware of the action required as the board submitted comprehensive proposals to amend the legislation under which it operates in December 1998. In the two and a half that have passed since nothing has been done by the Minister or the Government.</P>
      <P>The board has an escalating backlog of complaints as it is understaffed and under-resourced. The 1986 Act under which it operates requires major reform. As of December 1999 there were 809 outstanding complaints compared to December 1998 when there were 688 and December 1997 when there were 517. The fact that complaints about alleged garda misconduct are not addressed within a reasonable timeframe is unfair to members of the Garda who are victims of false allegations and to those members of the public who make valid complaints that deserve to be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report published last Thursday applies to 1999. The report for the year 2000 should also have been published by now. If it were, it is likely it would repeat the criticisms and concerns contained in the 1999 report. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to state publicly whether he has yet received the Garda Complaint Board's report for the year 2000 and when he intends to publish it. As an interim measure, I also call on him urgently to bring before the Dáil the legislative changes sought by the board and provide the board with the <Col N="129" /> resources it needs to fulfil its statutory duties. If he fails to do so, it is inevitable that at some future date the State will be held to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights for failing to have in place an independent body capable of conducting independent investigations into allegations of garda misconduct within a reasonable time after a complaint has been received.</P>
    <P>It is the view of Fine Gael that ultimately the Garda Complaints Board should be replaced by a Garda ombudsman. As the Minister has stubbornly rejected the need for a Garda Ombudsman, at the very least he should reform the 1986 Act under which the board operates. It is particularly ironic that while advocating the establishment of a Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland, as recommended in the Patten report, during his four years in office the Minister has not only rejected the call for such an ombudsman in this State, he has totally failed to introduce the reforms which the Garda Complaints Board has repeatedly stated are required for it to properly fulfil the functions for which it was originally established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the concerns the Deputy has raised in relation to matters contained in the recently published report of the Garda Complaints Board. As I have already indicated in this House, most recently in the course of replies to questions on 23 May, I accept that the current arrangements for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda are not satisfactory and need to be revised. As the Deputy is aware, this is an issue I am pursuing in the context of a comprehensive review I have been carrying out in relation to Garda complaints generally. The recent report from the Garda Complaints Board has been fully taken into account in the course of the review. For the purposes of my review it has been necessary to consider the implications of a number of recent cases from Northern Ireland which were decided by the European Court of Human Rights. These cases have important implications for the investigation of police conduct in all the member states of the Council of Europe and address a wide range of complex legal, and other, issues. In that context, the Deputy will appreciate that the relevant matters must be properly considered before final decisions are taken on what changes are necessary to ensure there is full compliance by this country with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to permit Garda procedures to be reviewed with reference to whether they have measured up to the appropriate policing standards. I expect very shortly to publish my proposals for substantial reform of the machinery for Garda complaints.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> Yesterday morning on their way to work the Meenmore, Dungloe employees of Arramara were shocked to hear the news that the factory was to close with the loss of 12 jobs. While the news was devastating, the method of its delivery was cruel in the extreme. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources issued the diktat from his constituency the previous night without reference to the board of Arramara Teo., the employees or anyone else. The arrogance was breathtaking. No meetings were held, no advice sought, no soundings taken, no alternatives considered: it was just a <i>fait accompli</i>. Is that the proper way to treat workers who have given many years of loyalty to a company? </P>
    <P>My criticism of the Minister's handling of this debacle is not just political. There has been widespread criticism of his actions by members of his own party. Human beings should be treated with more courtesy, sympathy, respect and understanding than the Minister was prepared to give.</P>
    <P>Arramara is a long established company. It was founded in 1947 in Galway and in 1968 in Dungloe. It is based on a natural renewable resource, seaweed, and is unique in that the Minister is the majority shareholder, owning 51% of the company. The balance is held by ISP Alginates, a company based in Scotland. The company directly employs 34 staff and up to 400 other people involved in seasonal seaweed harvesting along the western seaboard. I estimate that 200 of those part-time workers will be affected by the closure of the Dungloe plant. The company returned a small profit almost every year and paid a dividend to shareholders until recent times but no money was ever invested in improving facilities, marketing or research and development. This is certainly not the case with many of its sister semi-State companies which receive huge amounts of cash annually.</P>
    <P>Arramara provided a social service to communities along the west coast, particularly when alternative employment was difficult to find. The number affected in Donegal will be 12 full-time employees, around 200 part-time or seasonal harvesters and a haulage contractor who invested in specially adapted lorries to load and transport seaweed. Many local engineering companies, garages and shops will also see a drop in their turnover. A whole community will be affected.</P>
    <P>It is significant that under the Minister's restructuring plan all surviving operations will be relocated in Kilkieran, the Galway centre. This seems to be the Minister's own decision made without reference to the board. It has all the appearances of being a political decision or an exercise in keeping his own constituents happy at the expense of the Donegal workers. Decisions with such social and economic consequences should not be taken in the name of political expediency. Can the Minister of State inform us of the plans for the future of the Meenmore facility? Will it be maintained for future production purposes or are there plans to sell it to help finance the Kilkieran facility? The workers are anxious, and entitled, to know. What does the future hold for the 200 seaweed harvesters who will, in all probability, lose a valuable source of <Col N="131" /> income? Can they expect compensation or redundancy? They have made a massive contribution in difficult conditions to Arramara. Are they also to be consigned to the economic scrapheap?</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage these valuable jobs can be saved. There is a demand for such a product and the expertise is there. A joint approach by the Minister and Údarás na Gaeltachta &ndash; I am delighted to see the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands here &ndash; should be initiated. A capital injection may be sufficient to safeguard the livelihoods of the Donegal families depending on the continuation of Arramara.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, drochscéal é seo don Clochán Liath agus don cheantar Gaeltachta i dTír Chonaill. Tá súil agam nach é sin deireadh an scéal agus go ndéanfar rud éigin chun na postanna seo a chaoimhniú san am atá romhainn.</P>

As a person from a coastal community I am very conscious of the difficulties mentioned by Deputy McGinley and others who have raised this issue. The Minister confirmed in a statement yesterday that Arramara Teoranta is to be restructured in order to restore its long-term viability and develop the business into the future.

      <P>I apologise for the Minister, who is out of the country on State business. He has been in contact with me today to assure those who raised the issue that he will be working as hard as he can to ensure the 12 people involved are accommodated in whatever way is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arramara Teoranta was established in 1947 to produce seaweed meal for use in the alginate industry. Alginates have a wide variety of applications ranging from use in food and animal feed production to the pharmaceutical industry. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources holds 51% of the shares in Arramara Teo. on behalf of the Government. ISP Alginates (UK) Ltd, formerly Kelco, hold the remaining 49% of the issued shares. Called up share capital stands at £77,000. The company operates two plants. Its main base is at Kilkieran, Connemara, and it operates a second plant at Meenmore, Dungloe, County Donegal. The company employs 34 people in total with up to 400 people traditionally engaged in seasonal seaweed harvesting along the <Col N="132" /> coast from Malin Head to Loop Head. Much of the seaweed currently being processed in Meenmore is now collected from Mayo.</P>
    <P>Due to downturns in the global alginate market, combined with increased competition from Chile, China and other countries, Arramara Teo. has experienced trading difficulties which have accelerated in the past 12 months. ISP, which throughout has been Arramara's main customer, has reduced its annual purchases of weed from 6,500 tonnes in 1997 to just 2,000 tonnes in 2001. Third party sales have been developed from a very low base in the mid-1990s to 3,000 tonnes in 2000. Losses of £108,215 were incurred in 1999 and losses of £174,799 last year.</P>
    <P>A business review of the company's prospects was commissioned by my Department in consultation with the other shareholder and the company. The independent economic consultants recommended the business can be restored to viability if operations are restructured on the basis of relocation of all production to Arramara's Connemara plant which can fully service expected product demand. This is in line with the company's conclusion that this rationalisation is essential. This restructuring is expected to entail the closure and sale by the company of the facility at Meenmore, County Donegal. There are 12 permanent employees and three temporary staff at Meenmore.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that discussions are ongoing between the shareholders and the company's bank on financing of the proposed restructuring which will require funding of £350,000. When a satisfactory financial agreement is concluded the company will take the necessary formal decisions in relation to the Meenmore closure and company rationalisation, consult the staff and proceed with negotiations on a fair and reasonable package. In that context the Minister has confirmed that he will give high priority to the possible scope for development of alternative projects at Meenmore in consultation with all relevant interests. I discussed this with the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and she is very keen, from a political point of view as well as on behalf of Donegal, that something is done. She is to have a round of formal talks with those concerned.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation is fundamental to restoring the viability of the company at this time and to securing its future. In this regard the Minister has Government agreement to negotiate the best possible funding package which will reposition the company on a solid footing and enable it to develop into the future. Legislation will be brought forward to underpin any funding decision on foot of a satisfactory agreement being concluded.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 June 2001.</P>

      <P>The excessive application of fertilisers to crops can increase their susceptibility to disease, lodging, and in certain crops inferior quality. Excessive fertiliser application can lead to increased losses of nutrients from soils, through leaching into ground water, particularly in peat and sandy soils, and as run-off in surface water. High levels of phosphorus in soils can result in gradual losses of this nutrient to waters over time even where application of the nutrient has ceased.</P>
      <P>The leaching of nitrates to ground waters can result in unacceptable levels in drinking water. The losses of nitrates and phosphates to rivers, lakes and estuarine waters can cause pollution which may result in eutrophication and on occasions the formation of algal bloom in lakes. A key priority which has driven the work of my Department has been the continued promotion of the REP scheme which stipulates the efficient use of fertilisers in an environmentally friendly manner. Furthermore, farmer participation in REPS is expected to increase from the current level of 45,000 to 70,000 by 2005.</P>

      <P>The mandate given to the European Commission in respect of the World Trade Organisation agriculture negotiations was adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 and subsequently endorsed by the General Affairs Council. It was based largely on the Agenda 2000 agreement adopted by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999. On 21 November 2000 the Council of Agriculture Ministers approved a comprehensive negotiating proposal, based on this <Col N="134" /> mandate, which was then forwarded to the WTO in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The WTO negotiations on agriculture began in March 2000 under Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture reached as part of the Uruguay Round. The period to March 2001 involved the submission of position papers, analysis and debate on issues raised by WTO member countries. In March 2001, a work programme for a further 12 months, involving an in-depth examination of issues and proposals presented in the first phase, was agreed. I expect substantive negotiations on all issues to begin when this work programme has been completed. Agriculture may, however, be included in the launch of a broad round of multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO ministerial conference which will be held in Qatar in November.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the importance of export refunds and direct payments for Irish agriculture and I believe that the Commission's negotiating mandate provides a satisfactory basis for protecting our interests.</P>

      <P>At the recent Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting it was put to member states that the ban on the use of meat and bone meal as an animal feedingstuff should remain in place. The proposal stated that the ban would be reviewed in the light of the European Commission's decisions with regard to the BSE status of countries and the implementation of the Animal By-products Regulation for the production, monitoring and control of all such by-products. In the event there was no qualified majority in favour or against the proposal and it is matter for the Commission to adopt the proposal on its own authority. Ireland supported the Commission proposal and feels that the prolongation of the feed ban is justified at the present time. It should also be noted that no member state argued for the lifting of the ban.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef market in Ireland is satisfactory at present and has been since the beginning of the year. The main reason for this is the operation of the purchase for <Col N="135" /> destruction scheme which has underpinned prices for over 30 month cattle. This scheme will have removed some 275,000 animals from the market by 30 June at a cost of approximately £200 million to the Irish taxpayer. A more recent factor has been the foot and mouth disease situation in Britain and the Netherlands which has disrupted slaughterings in these countries and has given rise to market opportunities for Irish beef.</P>
      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme will be replaced, from 1 July, by a special purchase scheme which will not apply to steers. In this situation, the steer beef market will be supported through intervention and export refunds. As far as intervention is concerned, I negotiated two major concessions at the meeting of the Agriculture Council last week. First, I secured an increase of 150,000 tonnes in the intervention ceiling for this year. This means that, taking account of purchases into intervention to-date this year, there is scope for an additional 310,000 tonnes to be sold into intervention for the remainder of the year. Secondly, I have secured a commitment from the Commission that the intervention system will be used to stabilise the market in the autumn. This will ensure an orderly transition from the end of the purchase for destruction scheme and will remove a significant uncertainty in relation to market supports for the coming months.</P>
      <P>As far as the market outlook is concerned, there are reasonable prospects that the demand for Irish beef in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands will remain firm. I have recently announced the re-opening of the Russian market and this will provide a valuable outlet. Clearly, however, it is of major importance that all third markets which are currently closed because of BSE are re-opened as soon as possible. I will be using all of the resources available to me to secure the re-opening of these markets. Egypt is particularly important in view of the size of that market for Irish beef and there has been ongoing intensive contact at senior and technical level in recent weeks. There has also been ongoing work by Bord Bia within that market. The Egyptian authorities have agreed to send a senior veterinary delegation to Ireland to consider the situation on the ground and I remain hopeful that this initiative, which arose out of recent contacts, will open the way to resumption of trade. As regards the Gulf, which is another important third country market, I am ensuring that diplomatic contact remains focused on a re-opening of that market. At present, a senior veterinary official of my Department is visiting the Gulf States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>From information circulated at the Standing Veterinary Committee on 21 June, I understand that the position as at 19 June 2001 was that 1,764 outbreaks of FMD had been confirmed in Great Britain. An additional four outbreaks were confirmed in Northern Ireland, last case confirmed on 22 April 2001, bringing the total outbreaks in the United Kingdom to 1,768. Details of the breakdown of the number of animals slaughtered in the United Kingdom have been forwarded to the Deputy as a tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The number of confirmed FMD outbreaks in Great Britain as a whole reached a peak of 303 in the week commencing 20 March. Since then, the number of outbreaks confirmed each week has fallen, roughly halving every two weeks to a low of 22 for the week commencing 15 May. The total number of outbreaks recorded for each of the weeks commencing 22 May, 29 May, 5 June, and 12 June, were 36, 42, 29, and 30 respectively. I would be hopeful that the UK can eradicate the disease in the near future.</P>
      <P>From our perspective, the continuing disclosure of FMD cases in Britain, some in areas not previously affected, serves as a reminder that FMD still represents a very serious threat to this country. For so long as additional cases are being confirmed in Great Britain, I will continue to regard the situation there as a significant threat, and will continue to take appropriate precautions. Effective biosecurity and disinfection measures on farms, marts and agricultural premises and some controls on animal movements continue to be essential.</P>
      <P>Over the past few weeks there have been phased resumptions and normalisation of cattle movements culminating in the re-opening of the marts on Monday, 18 June. Animals can now be assembled for export and the build-up of stocks on farms can be gradually disposed of. In allowing marts to re-open, the trading needs of the farming community is being balanced alongside veterinary advice on the measures needed to protect against the spread of disease. The situation is being kept under ongoing review, and the advice of the expert group will continue to be sought in assessing the scope for further changes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that more than three months have elapsed since the one and only outbreak of FMD was confirmed here. In accordance with the International Animal Health Code of the OIE, Ireland has regained its status as an &ldquo;FMD free country where vaccination is not practised&rdquo;. A submission was made to the OIE on 22 June last in relation to the follow-up actions taken here and that body will now undertake the necessary administrative process to formalise the Irish position.</P>

Qualified applicants have been advised of the dates and asked to confirm their attendance. It had been hoped to hold courses earlier this year for suitably qualified individuals who wished to establish themselves as REPS planning agencies under the new scheme. Provisional arrangements had been made, but my Department had to cancel them in line with precautions against the possible spread of foot and mouth disease. A visit to a suitable farm for demonstration purposes is a central part of the course for all participants, and obviously this could not have taken place during the emergency. I have previously given an undertaking that my Department would reschedule the courses as soon as it was practical and safe to do so, and I am glad that the successful containment of the disease has now made it possible.</P>

      <P>Mechanical grading trials were carried out in Ireland in August 1999 and March 2000 and the results were communicated to the EU Commission in March 2000. Similar trials were also carried out in Germany, Denmark and France. These trials were the subject of discussion at beef management committee meetings in March and April 2000.</P>
      <P>The consensus of opinion was that the trials in Ireland had been carried out in a highly professional manner. While the three machines involved achieved high accuracy results in relation to conformation and meat content of the carcases, they were less accurate in relation to fatness and, in general, they failed to attain the standards set down by the EU Commission in a draft regulation setting standards to be met by these machines prior to their approval for classification purposes. Following discussion in the beef management committee, the Commission agreed to carry out a pilot test to examine whether the standards and procedures set out in the draft regulation were practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> Germany was selected as the venue for the pilot test which was to be held at the end of November 2000. Unfortunately, because of the BSE crisis in Germany, it was not possible to proceed with the trial. It is the intention of the Commission to proceed with the trial next September. An official from my Department will take part in the trial. As soon as this work is completed and the Commission has set standards for approval of mechanical systems, it is my intention to proceed with the authorisation trial, which will hopefully lead to the early introduction of mechanical beef classification in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The second phase of the scheme, involving a subsidised collection charge at farm level for fallen animals, has been agreed with the animal collectors and this phase of the scheme will commence on 1 July 2001.

      <P>Under the installation aid scheme introduced earlier this year, applicants born on or after 1 January 1975 must have the Teagasc certificate in farming or an equivalent qualification. However, a young farmer born before 1 January 1975 shall also be deemed to have adequate training and experience if he or she has a minimum of three years experience in farming and has completed courses of recognised training in agriculture or horticulture of at least 180 hours.</P>
      <P>With regard to the milk quota regime, educational qualifications, including the Teagasc certificate in farming are among the criteria used to establish the eligibility of younger dairy farmers and new entrants to dairying regarding the allocation of quotas to younger farmers from the additional quantities available from 1 April 2000 and 1 April 2001 under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the allocation of the new entrant category under the 2001 milk quota restructuring scheme.</P>
      <P>The holding of the Teagasc certificate in farming is not mandatory for participation in the on-farm investment schemes generally. The highest level of formal training required for the three schemes covering farm waste management, the improvement of dairy hygiene standards and housing handling facilities for alternative enterprises, introduced on 1 February this year, are courses of recognised training in agriculture or horticulture of a minimum of 180 hours in the case of applicants born on or after 1 January 1975. However, in relation to the schemes of investment aid for farm waste management or the improvement of dairy hygiene standards, additional investment aid is available to young trained farmers under 35 years of age who, at the date of application, have commenced farming in the previous five years and have obtained the Teagasc certificate in farming or an equivalent qualification. A young farmer born before 1 January 1975 shall also be deemed to have met the training and experience criteria for the additional aid if he or she has a minimum of three years experience in farming and has completed courses of recognised training in agriculture or horticulture of at least 180 hours.</P>
      <P>EU direct income payments are not conditional on the recipient holding the Teagasc certificate in farming.</P>

      <P>The EU regulation governing the scheme of early retirement from farming does not allow for any such extension. Article 3(1) of council regulation 2079/92, under which the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming was introduced, states that the pension cannot be paid beyond the 70th birthday of the retired farmer.</P>
      <P>A retired farmer who comes to the end of his or her time in the early retirement scheme and has no other source of income would, of course, be entitled to apply for the non-contributory old age pension, which is means-tested.</P>
      <P>The new early retirement scheme, which was introduced last November as part of the rural development plan, allows for the early retirement pension to be paid to the age of 70 for those farmers who joined the scheme in the year 2000. The upper age limit then comes down one year at a time and will be fixed at 66 for those farmers who join the scheme after 2003. This is designed to reduce overlaps between the early retirement pension and state pensions, which have to be offset against it.</P>

      <P>The beef task force monitoring committee is responsible for implementing those recommendations in the report of the task force relating to export promotion, price transparency, graded pricing and mechanical classification.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress had been made within the monitoring committee on the establishment of a voluntary beef promotion fund, but this was put on hold following the dispute between meat factories and producers last year. As far as price transparency is concerned, my Department publishes, on a weekly basis, cattle prices paid by named individual meat factories. However, it has not been possible to secure agreement between the beef producers and beef processors on a market price transparency system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to graded pricing and mechanical classification the task assigned to the monitoring committee is to review progress in these areas. Primary responsibility for the implementation of a graded pricing system rests with the beef pro<Col N="142" /> cessing industry itself and, while I appreciate that some progress has been made in this area, I believe that bigger differentials are needed to encourage the production of the type of high quality beef in demand on the European market. As regards mechanical classification, my Department has, in conjunction with three developers from Denmark, Australia and Germany, organised a trial to test the accuracy of three machines in classifying carcases against the EUROP carcase classification scale and in estimating meat yield. The trial showed that mechanical classification has potential but needs to be improved if it is to replace visual assessment. Another test is being carried out by the EU in Germany in September. Experts from my Department will be participating.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that public funds should be provided for the industry and a development programme set up involving capital expenditure for new facilities and the suppression of inefficient operators that are surplus to requirements. The Government has already decided in the context of the national development plan to give priority to the beef sector at primary slaughtering and processing level.</P>
    <P>An operational programme to give effect to this has been devised and operating in partnership with the industry itself, should facilitate development and rationalisation in the beef processing industry in a planned way.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations of the beef task force largely concern primary production and, depending on their nature, are for implementation by the industry itself and by the relevant State agencies, in co-operation with my Department. These recommendations call for an improvement in the quality of cattle through better breeding and husbandry practices to ensure an adequate supply of high-quality beef needed to meet the demands of the EU market. Both Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation have intensified their efforts to promote the development of quality breeding by producers.</P>
    <P>However, producers' decisions in this area will be based on the extent to which quality production is rewarded. This is primarily a matter for the industry itself.</P>

      <P>Agriculture is one of the areas of co-operation with Northern Ireland identified under the Good Friday Agreement. The issues for discussion include animal health policy.</P>
      <P>The programme of work on animal health adopted by the North-South Ministerial Council in its agriculture sector format involved the formalisation of liaison arrangements at official level on animal health matters, including the establishment of a strategic steering group, which will co-ordinate animal health policy on the island and make regular reports on co-operation on animal health matters together with recommendations for policy and/or operational decisions to the North-South Ministerial Council. Policy working groups are also to be established that will initially explore eight areas of animal health that apply to the whole island. These groups will be disbanded or formed as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past four months, I have had a number of meetings with Minister Bríd Rodgers, both within the North-South Ministerial Council and outside, and animal health issues were discussed at these meetings.

      <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions that the policy is to pay the market value of the flock, as is legally provided for. However, following representations from the IFA when the cull in Cooley was at an advanced stage, my Department accepted that certain sheep farmers appeared to have a case for a review of their valuations. The Department made a commitment that it would conduct such a review along lines that were generally understood. The basis for the review was a perceived inequity in the valuations of flocks culled, particularly those dealt with early in the process relative to those culled at a later date. In line with its commitment, the Department carried out a detailed review of such cases and concluded the exercise on 14 May.</P>
      <P>The review comprised an examination of valuations on 286 files, followed by a further investigation of 182 cases in which it was established that this was warranted. Valuers were requested to re-examine these files and supplementary payments, totalling £415,000 and ranging between an additional £80 and an additional £23,500, were recommended. These recommendations were accepted by the Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the valuation review in relation to the Cooley flocks was conducted in a fair, detailed, professional and speedy manner. I understand that the relevant payments have been made at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the confirmation of a case of foot and mouth disease in Proleek, County Louth, my immediate priority was the containment of the disease to a single outbreak within the jurisdiction. I had already established a local disease control centre in the area and had imposed stringent restrictions on the movement of susceptible animals throughout the country. As such, my primary concerns were the repeated clinical examination of all susceptible animals within a 10km radius of the outbreak, the tracing of any animal movements in and out of the area, the organisation of a cull of animals within the Cooley Peninsula and the investigation and follow-up of other reports of suspect cases throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This was a massive undertaking which required unprecedented efforts of organisation, management and execution. It included serological surveillance in relation to suspect holdings and flocks on an ongoing and immediate basis and of all flocks in the Cooley Peninsula. In relation to flocks and herds in the surveillance zone in County Louth, the serosurveillance was required to commence under EU rules no sooner than 21 days after the preliminary cleansing and disinfection of the outbreak farm at Proleek. It was required to be completed before area restrictions in the Cooley Peninsula could be lifted on 30 April. Once this serosurveillance was completed, work began on the national serosurveillance with a view to completing as much as possible before 22 June, the date on which we were entitled to claim foot and mouth disease-free status in accordance with international criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to understand that serosurveillance is designed to look for antibodies to foot and mouth disease and that, in flocks, these may take some time to develop to detectable levels. This is the reason EU rules require at least 21 days to elapse in affected areas before testing of the <Col N="146" /> remaining flocks can commence. A gap of seven weeks before commencing the national surveillance, the results of which were of relevance to the restoration of our foot and mouth disease-free status on 22 June, is therefore advantageous in improving the detectability of any problems that may emerge.</P>

      <P>The special purchase scheme, aimed at supporting the market, will come into effect from 1 July. It will give member states the option of either destroying the beef or storing it for eventual disposal as food aid or other humanitarian purposes. However, the disposal of the beef will be subject to prior approval of the European Commission in the context of its beef management committee. I have not yet taken any definitive decision on this matter. Any decision to store the beef for eventual use by charitable organisations will have to take account of the level of demand, the precise requirements of the organisations, the length of time the beef is likely to remain in store before release and the cost and controls involved in an approach that mixes destruction and storage.</P>

      <P>The Commission proposals adopted by the Council last week in Brussels provide for an increase in the intervention ceiling for 2001 and for a number of changes to the beef premium system. The rationale behind the proposals is, first, to provide additional support for the beef market this autumn and, secondly, to bring about a better balance in the EU market in the medium term. These measures are necessary because of the sharp fall in consumption in the EU and the closure of the major third country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objectives in the negotiations were to secure an increase in the intervention ceiling to cope with the autumn beef surplus, to achieve an <Col N="147" /> orderly transition from the end of the purchase for destruction scheme and to minimise the impact of any reductions in premiums or quotas on Irish producers. I am satisfied that I secured these objectives in the negotiations. The decisions of the Council, particularly the increase of 150,000 tonnes in the intervention ceiling for 2001, will place the beef sector in a much stronger position to deal with the ongoing surplus arising from the sharp fall in consumption as a result of the BSE crisis at the end of last year. I have also secured a commitment from the Commission that the intervention system will be used to stabilise the market in the autumn, which will remove a significant uncertainty in relation to market supports for the coming months.</P>
    <P>I succeeded in restricting the proposals on the special beef premium and suckler cow quotas to 2002 and 2003. The proposal on individualisation of the special beef premium quota has been removed and the minimum heifer requirement in the suckler cow premium has been reduced from 20% to 15%, which is close to the normal suckler cow replacement rate. In addition, I secured an exemption from this requirement for producers with less than 14 suckler cows, which will exclude two thirds of Irish producers. Furthermore, the reduction in the stocking density limit from 2.0 to 1.8 lu/ha will be phased in over two years. With regard to the special beef premium quota, I believe that the new quota, which is 3% higher than payments made in recent years, will be adequate for our requirements. In this regard, it should be noted that applications for the special beef premium this year are 15 % lower than in 2000 and male calf registrations are also down.</P>
    <P>As far as the overall package is concerned, I am satisfied that any loss in premium income to Irish farmers will be minimal and will be substantially outweighed by the higher level of intervention support I have negotiated as part of the package. In the absence of these arrangements, there was a real prospect that cattle prices in Ireland would collapse in the autumn. In view of the dependence of the Irish beef industry on export markets, it is in the long-term interests of Irish producers, more than any other group of producers, that the EU market is restored to balance as soon as possible. Such an agreement was reached at this particular Council.</P>

From that date all sheep must be tagged on movement off farm with a tag bearing the flock number of the farm and an individual number. This information is being recorded in sheep slaughter plants and, under the terms of the NSIS, must be shown on a label on the finished carcass. All sheep remaining on farms must be tagged at the latest by 15 December. Ireland therefore has full traceability for sheep on an individual animal basis, for the first time.

      <P>A total of £8.3 million was paid in 2000 in respect of 29,525 hectares of set-aside land under the EU arable aid scheme. Applications for the scheme for 2001 are being processed so it is too early to predict the exact area set aside in 2001. It is likely that the area and the expenditure will increase for a number of reasons. The payment rate for set-aside in 2001 is £301.67 (383.04) per hectare compared to £280.93 (356.71) per hectare in 2000. Having considered the arrangements for set-aside under the arable aid system for the 2001 harvest, I decided that the voluntary set-aside limit would be increased from 10%, which applied in 2000, to 20%. Along with the obligatory rate of 10%, this allowed farmers to set aside up to an aggregate of 30% of land for which arable aid is claimed this year. My decision was taken as an exceptional measure aimed at facilitating growers of winter cereals unable to sow their crops because of persistent wet weather. Such farmers had therefore a greater degree of flexibility in deciding whether to divert their land to spring crops or to put it into set-aside as and from 15 January 2001.</P>
      <P>A further exceptional measure in relation to set-aside was also put in place this year as a result of the impact of foot and mouth disease controls in County Louth. Arable aid applicants in County Louth were given a special concession whereby they could put up to 100% of their eligible land into set-aside in 2001. This concession was aimed at facilitating farmers in the county and discouraging the movement of farm machinery there as far as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards set-aside arrangements in future years, Agenda 2000 set the compulsory rate of set-aside for larger arable farmers  &ndash; more than 15.13 hectares at 10% until 2006. Each member state can decide annually on the level of voluntary set-aside to put in place. As I said already, this was an exceptional year in terms of weather conditions so I decided that all producers could set aside up to 30% of their eligible land. I expect that, given normal farming conditions, the maximum level of set-aside will revert to the normal 20% limit in 2002. I will keep this under review and will make a decision towards the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union adopted regulations last year to introduce compulsory labelling of beef at all stages of production and marketing up to and including the final point of sale to the consumer. Under the regulations, which are being introduced in two phases, operators or organisations involved in the production and marketing of beef are required to label beef with certain compulsory information. The regulations apply to only to beef and there are no proposals, at this time, to extend the compulsory measures to include beef products such as pies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase, introduced on 1 September 2000, requires the following information to be provided: a reference number or code which enables the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived, the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located and the approval number of the de-boning hall and member state or third country in which it is located. The second phase will be introduced on 1 January 2002 and will require beef to be labelled with information concerning <Col N="151" /> the origin of the animals from which the beef was derived, in particular where the animals were born, fattened and slaughtered.</P>
    <P>These measures apply to beef produced in all member states of the European Union and the compulsory beef labelling system also applies to beef and beef products imported into the EU. In order to ensure that labelling arrangements relating to imported beef are of equivalent reliability to those applicable to EU beef, the Commission examines notifications received from third countries. Once the Commission is satisfied that the procedures and criteria applied in the country concerned are equivalent to those in the EU, it transmits notifications to the member states. In order to guarantee the reliability of the labelling system in third countries, the Commission may request additional information or carry out checks in the third country.</P>

      <P>The national sheep identification scheme, NSIS, came into operation on midsummer's day, 21 June. So far more than two million tags have been processed for flock-owners. From that date all sheep must be tagged on movement off farm with a tag bearing the flock number of the farm and an individual number. This information is being recorded in sheep slaughter-plants and, under the terms NSIS, must be shown on a label on the finished carcass. All sheep remaining on farms must be tagged at the latest by 15 December. Ireland thus has, for the first time, full traceability for all sheep, on an individual animal basis. Eight tag suppliers have been approved to supply tags under NSIS &ndash; this allows farmers a wide choice as to the type of tag they wish to use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of our non-European markets have been closed to Irish beef exports as a result of the BSE crisis in Europe late last year. The task of recovering those markets is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product and, with that in mind, my Department has been in ongoing contact or in correspondence with the relevant authorities in those countries which have been significant markets for Irish beef to point out to them the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in Ireland. While every effort, both directly and through diplomatic channels, is being made to re-open third country markets to Irish beef and livestock, it is, however, clear that a restoration of exports to those markets is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>
      <P>Egypt is our largest market for beef and much of our effort in recovering export markets has been focused on Egypt. I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Further visits to Egypt were undertaken by officials of my Department this year and I also took the opportunity last month to raise the matter with a visiting Egyptian ministerial delegation.</P>
      <P>Another important market is Saudi Arabia and a senior veterinary official of my Department travelled last January to Riyadh to brief the authorities there on our BSE controls. Senior officials of my Department are in Egypt and the Gulf region this week following up on earlier contacts with the relevant authorities there with a view to the restoration of these important markets. Arising out of ongoing contacts between my Department and the Egyptian authorities, it has been agreed that a delegation of Egyptian veterinary officials will travel to Ireland in early August. I remain hopeful that following that the market can be reopened.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the Egyptian and Saudi authorities have a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. However, in many of our non-EU markets, and Egypt is a good example, the situation has been exacerbated by adverse public opinion as a result of sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on the BSE developments in those EU countries which encountered their first cases last year.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to Russia is that the authorities there have lifted the total ban on Irish beef imposed following the single outbreak of FMD in Ireland last March. The earlier Russian ban on six named counties remains in place. My Department is finalising the details of the veterinary certificate required by the Russian authorities with a view to the early resumption of this trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the emerging foot and mouth disease crisis I established on 9 March the expert advisory group on foot and mouth disease controls. I asked the group to consider the extensive range of controls already in place at that time and to make recommendations to me as to how these might be adapted as the crisis developed. The group held its first meeting on 12 March and has met on ten other occasions since then. It immediately drew up a set of general recommendations which were accepted by me and which included guidelines for highest risk groups and the introduction of controls to allow low risk events such as meetings and sporting events to recommence. Special advice was also given by the group in relation to travel to and from foot and mouth disease infected areas.</P>
      <P>At successive meetings the basic set of recommendations were adapted to meet the evolving situation. In addition, a series of stringent protocols were drawn up by the group on the basis of risk assessment techniques and accepted by me, which provided for the resumption of activities such as horse racing. In addition, agriculture related activities, such as the use of marts as assembly centres for animals going for slaughter and the resumption of a strictly controlled AI service, were introduced on the recommendation of the group. Agreement was also reached with the public utilities on protocols for the resumption of their work on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>Special attention was paid to the hard pressed tourism sector and protocols drawn up which allowed for the resumption of rural tourism and activities which involved access to agricultural land, such as hill walking. During this period representatives of the group met with all interested parties and responded, where the level of risk allowed, at all times with practical protocols which provided for a gradual resumption of everyday activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gradually as the risk from the foot and mouth virus has receded, the expert group has recommended and I have accepted a continuing easing of controls which have been of tremendous practical benefit to the farming community. Most recently marts have reopened for trade in cattle with some necessary restrictions which the group <Col N="157" /> recommended as appropriate. I have found the recommendations sent to me by the expert group to be soundly based and practical, reflecting the high level of technical and professional expertise of its membership. It has earned the respect of all the major stakeholders in the agriculture sectors and in all sectors with which it came into contact. Most importantly, its recommendations have worked in practice. Ireland has experienced only one outbreak of foot and mouth disease and successfully contained it. I would like to put on record my thanks to the expert group for the key role it played in the tremendous national response to the foot and mouth disease crisis. The work of the group is not yet concluded. It will meet later this week to consider some remaining control measures, including cattle and sheep movement.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Irish beef processors are currently holding a quantity of beef which was produced prior to the introduction of the BSE testing or destruction requirement in relation to beef from over 30 month cattle. I understand the processors concerned are finding it difficult to dispose of these stocks. I have outlined to Commissioner Fischler the extent of the problem for the processors and have suggested that the purchase for destruction scheme should be used as a mechanism to deal with it. The Commissioner has not accepted this suggestion. Discussions are currently taking place with the Irish Meat Exporters Association to establish whether there are alternative solutions to the problem.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any current EU Commission proposals to reduce the general age for testing of all cattle for BSE down to 24 months. The general age threshold for test<Col N="158" /> ing cattle intended for human consumption remains at 30 months. However, member states will, from 1 July 2001, be obliged to test all fallen cattle over the age of 24 months for BSE. These animals would not, in any event, enter the human food chain. In addition, member states will, from 1 July 2001, be obliged to test all casualty and emergency slaughter cattle over 24 months for BSE. I do not consider these measures will put the Irish beef industry at any particular disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their counterparts in other member states.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of findings of illegal claims for grants by farmers in the order of £100 million. I assume the Deputy is referring to the cull of animals in County Louth in the context of foot and mouth and the position is as follows. Following the completion of this cull my Department carried out a detailed assessment of ewe premium applications compared to the number of sheep culled. This revealed significant discrepancies in a number of cases between the number of sheep culled and the number declared for ewe premium. The Department will proceed to withhold payments in these cases, impose appropriate penalties and, in the case of possible fraud, investigate with the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently conducting a full re-evaluation of ewe premium applications countrywide. The results of this evaluation are expected in the next few weeks and payment of the first instalment of 2001 ewe premium will not be made until this has been done. In addition, a system of individual sheep tagging has recently been introduced which will minimise the risk of such discrepancies arising in the future.</P>

      <P>The closure of the marts, in common with many other measures, was considered necessary in the context of foot and <Col N="159" /> mouth disease to safeguard the future of the agri-food industry. While difficulties were experienced by all sectors of society affected by the control measures adopted in recent months, it is clear that had such measures not been taken, the consequences would have been far worse for all concerned and for the economy in general.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I do not have any proposals to compensate the owners of marts or other businesses affected by the FMD controls. Such compensation would place an intolerable burden on the taxpayer and on the economy and would, in any event, be unmanageable. It has been and remains the policy of this Government to provide the correct economic framework to allow business, including agri-business, to thrive. To date this has been a singularly successful approach to encouraging economic development and I am confident that it remains the correct approach to encouraging recovery in all sectors affected by the foot and mouth crisis.</P>

In conducting these control checks, I have asked my officials to pay particular attention to sheep slaughter data in meat plants and to details of movements under the permit arrangements introduced on 3 March last.

      <P>I am familiar with this report which deals with the slaughter of cattle in <Col N="160" /> the UK. It must be remembered that the UK has a high incidence of BSE and that all cattle over 30 months of age are barred from the human food chain. This in not the case in Ireland, which has a low incidence of BSE and where cattle over 30 months of age may be slaughtered for human consumption. All such cattle are tested for BSE prior to being released into the human food chain. There is, therefore, no parallel situation in Ireland in which cattle deemed unfit for human consumption are slaughtered in the same premises as those intended for human consumption.</P>

      <P>No firm timescale has been fixed for the re-population of the Cooley Peninsula. However, restocking with cattle is being allowed on the Cooley Peninsula on a case by case basis. This is guided by the perceived level of risk involved in the various sectors of the Cooley. Severely high risk areas include the affected holdings, contiguous, associated land parcels, adjacent premises and holdings on which were found serologically positive animals. High <Col N="161" /> risk areas include the various commonages on which sheep grazed. Medium risk areas include the lowland farms on to which sheep were moved from the commonages and low risk areas are other lowland farms in the area.</P>
      <P>Repopulation will be conducted on the basis of the best available veterinary advice and in a phased and controlled manner. It will depend <i>inter alia</i> on the progress of the national sheep identification scheme and the results of the serological survey of the national sheep flock. I do not wish to rush into restocking in a manner which would put the livelihoods of farmers and others at risk if the virus is still present on the peninsula.</P>

      <P>To be registered as a commercial sheep shearer an applicant is required to supply to my Department his/her name, address, telephone number, date of birth and personal public service number. This is the minimum information required to establish the identity of the applicant. A copy of a passport is acceptable in cases where the applicant is not an Irish national. A registration certificate is then issued to the applicant by my Department. Shearers must give at least 24 hours prior notification to the district veterinary office responsible for the area in which the land or premises is located. This notification can be given by telephone or in writing. When the shearing is complete both the shearer and the flock owner complete a certificate which must be retained by both parties for a period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>Having regard to foot and mouth disease and the danger of the spread of the disease because of the close physical contact between the sheep shearer and the sheep, it is necessary to ensure that sheep shearing by commercial operators takes place under rigid monitoring and control arrangements. The 24 hour notification is essential as a means of tracking where sheep shearers are working in the event of a disease outbreak. It is considered that the arrangements that apply are essential in the current circumstances. There are no restrictions on flock owners shearing their own sheep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the lasting legacies of the recent crisis is the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, which gives authorised officers of my Department significant new powers, and which provides for dramatic new penalties for offences under the Diseases of Ani<Col N="163" /> mals Acts, including the seizure of assets, fines of up to £100,000 and/or jail terms of up to five years.</P>
      <P>In addition, a sheep tagging and traceability system has been introduced and from Thursday, 21 June, all sheep must be individually tagged prior to leaving the holding of origin and from 15 December, all sheep must be tagged on farm. In addition, measures have been introduced to regulate the activities of dealers. I am certain that these developments will have a significant impact on some of the practices which gave rise to a particular risk of spreading foot and mouth disease in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will carefully examine the range of control measures remaining in place, including those at ports and airports, and that I will consider retaining those controls to the extent that my veterinary advisers think it necessary or advisable, having due regard in the first instance to the need to prevent the spread of animal and human diseases and also to the need for normal farming business to resume to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>At European level I consider it appropriate, in light of the FMD crisis, to review the import regime applicable to animal based products imported into the European Union from third countries. I have called for such a review on a number of occasions at the Agriculture Council, and I will continue to press for this as a matter of priority. The community will also be reviewing other aspects, including the transfer of animals and animal disease control measures, over the ensuing months.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a single veterinary regime for the island of Ireland has been suggested. A considerable amount of work has already taken place, under the aegis of the North-South Ministerial Council, to identify possibilities for collaboration and co-operation in a range of animal health areas, and this will continue.</P>
      <P>However, this question is extremely complex. Any decision to establish a single veterinary regime would require both parts of the island to have equivalent animal health status. There is already a very considerable amount of equivalence. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the high incidence of BSE in the UK herd has meant that the exportation of livestock from Northern Ireland has been banned since 1996. There is also an over 30 months regime operating in the UK where such bovine animals are excluded from the food chain. There are some obstacles, therefore, which would need to be overcome.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that there has been an excellent degree of co-operation between ourselves and Northern Ireland on animal health issues. I will continue to focus on developing this relationship both at ministerial and official level.</P>

I am aware that the measure has had implications for trading in cattle. I have already relaxed a variety of the movement restrictions that were in place in relation to cattle movements from farm to farm, through marts and to slaughter plants. I have made specific arrangements for an exemption from the 30 day requirement in respect of live exports. I will keep the matter under close review in consultation with the expert review group which I established to advise me on such matters.</P>

It contained a derogation whereby, up until 1 January 1998, a maximum level of 500,000 cells per ml. was accepted in cows' milk going for manufacturing. Since that date the standard of 400,000 cells per ml. has applied to all cows' milk, whether going for liquid consumption or for manufacturing. It applies throughout the entire European Union and there is no prospect of reverting to the pre-1998 position. The present standard is readily achievable by all diligent milk producers and is in fact achieved without difficulty by the vast <Col N="165" /> majority of Irish producers. I have no plans to introduce a scheme along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the date the early farm retirement scheme first came into operation here; the provisions applied on that date for the calculation of the pension awarded to eligible persons; the changes which have been made since then in the calculation of the pension for eligible persons; and the date of application of each such change.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of early retirement from farming commenced on 7 January 1994. The scheme provided for the payment of an annual pension at a basic rate of 4,000 ECU plus 250 ECU per hectare of transferred or leased lands up to a maximum of 24 hectares. In 1996, the revaluation of the Irish pound against the ECU resulted in an increase of some 2.6%. The rate came down again by some 5.05% on 1 January 1999 when the euro was introduced.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the scheme, the maximum rates of payment have been as follows: 10,000 ECU per annum, £9,764.26, up to and including 31 December 1995; 10,000 ECU per annum, £10,016.26, from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1998; 12,075 per annum, £9,509.83, from 1 January 1999 to date.</P>
      <P>The reduction from 1 January 1999 is permanent, but the Council of Ministers approved a three year scheme of compensation. During 2000, full compensation was paid to all participants in the scheme whose payments had been reduced during 1999. Compensation was set at 75% of the loss incurred in respect of reductions in payments during 2000 and this was paid in March 2001. The compensation scheme provides for a third payment in respect of reductions in payments during 2001. The rate of this compensation has yet to be determined and approval for this payment will be sought from the European Commission in due course.</P>
      <P>The new scheme of early retirement from farming, which commenced on 27 November 2000, was introduced under Council Regulation (EC) 1257/1999. This scheme provides for payment of an annual pension at a basic rate of 5,403, IR£4,255.21, and 338, IR£266.20, per hectare of transferred or leased lands up to a maximum of 24 hectares. The maximum pension payable is 13,515, IR£10,644.</P>

      <P>Eight tag suppliers have been approved to supply tags to farmers under the national sheep identification system. This allows farmers a wide choice as to the type of tag they wish to use and commercial competition has ensured that tags are available at a reasonable price. The approved suppliers have now processed over two million tags and I am confident that the demand for tags can be met in full within a reasonable time-frame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the production of all fruit in 1980 was 17,700 tonnes, of which apples accounted for 11,000 tonnes. The comparable figures for 2000 are 13,100 tonnes in total, of which 10,800 tonnes are in respect of apples. While apple production has remained relatively stable, the production of other fruits has declined due mainly to a fall off in processing. However, producers now have better returns as they are focusing on the production of high value fruit for the fresh market.</P>
      <P>There are a number of schemes available for growers to improve production methods, quality and supply of fruit. An investment aid scheme for the horticulture sector operated by my Department under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will provide aid for fruit growers. In addition, a post-harvest capital investment scheme for marketing and processing of agricultural products, including fruit, was recently launched by my Department under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Growers who form producer organisations under the common organisation of the market can also avail of EU aid. An Bord Glas operate a quality assurance programme for growers to ensure that produce is of a high standard acceptable to consumers, and research into improved fruit production is carried out by Teagasc.</P>

      <P>The closure of the marts, in common with many other measures, was considered necessary, in the context of foot and mouth disease, to safeguard the future of the agri-food industry. While difficulties were experienced by all sectors of society affected by the control measures adopted in recent months, it is clear that had such measures not been taken, the consequences would have been far worse for all concerned and for the economy in general.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I do not have any proposals to compensate the owners of marts or other businesses affected by the FMD controls. Such compensation would place an intolerable burden on the taxpayer and on the economy and would, in any event, be unmanageable. It has been and remains the policy of this Government to provide the correct economic framework to allow business, including agri-business, to develop and prosper. To date, this has been a singularly successful approach to encouraging economic development and I am confident that it remains the correct approach to encouraging recovery in all sectors affected by the foot and mouth crisis.</P>

      <Quest> the progress which has been made by the task force established by her Department in respect of a replacement industry for Dunmanway, County Cork arising from the closure of a company (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dunmanway interagency task force was established in response to the announced closure of the facility with effect from 11 February 2000 with the loss of 113 jobs. The task force is chaired by IDA Ireland and comprises representatives from Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the county enterprise board and the county manager for west Cork. The main focus for the task force is on attracting a replacement industry and providing assistance to employees, such as advice on alternative career opportunities and training/retraining courses.</P>
      <P>The factory was purchased by O'Flynn Construction on 31 August 2000. This company has developed major office parks such as the University Technology Park, Cork, and the Eastgate Business Park at Little Island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland has collaborated with O'Flynn Construction to produce a colour brochure to advertise the factory. O'Flynn Construction has also taken out a half page advertisement in the national newspapers to promote the factory. The IDA has supplied lists of companies which it considers may be interested in the factory, including contacts in IDA overseas offices worldwide, and contacts within IDA's operating divisions. Copies <Col N="178" /> of the new brochure have been made available to the Dunmanway employment initiative. There have been a number of visits to the facility but, so far, only one of the companies has shown a small amount of interest in the factory. However, vigorous efforts are continuing to be made to secure a tenant.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties in promoting the factory is the skill set of the former workforce, which is mainly related to the textile industry, cutting and sewing operations. Of the new employment opportunities arising in the south-west region, 80% come from three sources &ndash; pharmaceuticals and health care, international service operations and electronics. Opportunities for employment for those with textile skills have been in decline throughout the nation, except for niche markets.</P>
    <P>On 21 and 22 March 2000, FÁS attended Dunmanway to register participants for a return to work/ECDL course. This course took place from 10 April to 14 July, with 24 participants. On completion of the course, 11 participants were placed in employment while others expressed an interest in further training. However, there has been a poor response to the FÁS follow-up survey from these participants.</P>
    <P>On 4 and 5 September 2000, FÁS attended Dunmanway to register participants for a second return to work/ECDL course. This course did not generate the same level of interest and FÁS was unable to fill this course. The course commenced on 25 October 2000 and finished in January 2001, with 22 participants, many from Skibbereen and surrounding areas. FÁS has now contacted all ex-employees of the company and it is its intention to run another course for these people. Both IDA Ireland and FÁS maintain on-going contact with the Dunmanway employment initiative. IDA Ireland will continue to market Dunmanway for potential overseas investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a submission proposing tax benefits, particularly in relation to buildings suitable for IT and entertainment industries, for parts of the south-west region, i.e., west Cork, south Kerry and areas in north Cork/north Kerry. The submission was made in the context of seeking to develop parts of the region considered to be particularly disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>A representative of the regional authority and some other private and public partners in the region discussed the matter with my Department on 15 June. I understand that this representative intends to discuss the matter with the Department of Finance and it is expected that further discussion with my Department will then be requested.</P>
      <P>The type of proposal put forward in this case is subject to the regional aid limits laid down by the EU Commission for the various regions in the European Union. While all regions in Ireland are still eligible for regional aid, our high economic growth in recent years means that the south and east regions in Ireland are moving to aid rates which are lower than the rates applying in the Border, midlands and west region. Industrial projects in all regions are eligible for grant aid from agencies such as IDA or Enterprise Ireland. Should a tax incentive scheme also apply to such a project, the combined effect of the grant and tax schemes would still have to respect the maximum aid level for the region laid down by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The challenge of achieving balanced regional development is a multifaceted one which is addressed in many aspects of the national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006. These policies, which have a particular focus on infrastructure development, human resource development and the stimulation of productive investment by the private sector, are being implemented across a range of Departments.</P>
      <P>As part of the implementation of the national development plan, a focus on regional development is being implemented by the industrial development agencies. IDA has intensified its efforts to achieve a better distribution of overseas investment into the regions and Enterprise Ireland has also developed a comprehensive approach to achieving balanced regional development. At present, both IDA and Enterprise Ireland have under consideration the extent to which incentives in relation to the development of industrial property may be necessary as part of their industrial strategies. I will examine the proposal from the South West Regional Authority in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>An officer from the labour inspectorate of my Department has visited this company and, following an examination of records, has not found evidence of payments falling below the national minimum rate of pay. From the material available the Inspector found that, up to 1 April 2001, the lowest hourly rate of pay was £4.40 and from that date the rate of pay was increased to £5.00 per hour.</P>
      <P>In addition, the inspector has determined from the records examined, that double time is paid for Sundays and public bank holidays. A Saturday allowance, as well as an early shift allowance and a late shift allowance, is also paid. There was no evidence to suggest that rates of pay are differentiated between nationals and non-nationals working for this company.</P>
      <P>The inspector has, however, determined that the rates of pay being applied are not in line with the terms of the current employment regulation order which applies to workers in that sector. As a consequence, certain arrears are likely to be due to all employees affected. This matter is being actively attended to by the company and the inspector will be following up in this regard very shortly. The employment regulation order mentioned above is new to the sector concerned and only came into effect from 1 April 2001. The employer in this case has indicated that the company was unaware of its recent introduction and, with regard to pay, had been adhering to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness as a guide to pay determination.</P>
      <P>Apart from the arrears situation already mentioned, the Inspector has sought clarification in respect of certain deductions from wages and is also examining the company's practices in regard to holiday entitlements and the provision of contracts of employment to staff.</P>

As part of the conditions under which the aid was authorised, the EU imposed certain restrictions on production and sales by the company until June 2000. The details are set out in the following tables:</P>

    <P>The EU also imposed a restriction on capacity increasing investment by the company until May 2001 whereby the liquid steel capacity could not be increased above the existing level of 500,000 tonnes per annum and the existing hot-rolling capacity of 343,000 tonnes per annum in finished products could not be increased, other than resulting from productivity improvements.</P>
    <P>Also as part of the EU approval of the State aid at the time of the sale process in 1996, a bilateral agreement between Denmark and Ireland was made on 20 December 1995 under which it was agreed that Irish Steel Ltd./Irish Ispat Ltd. would not put on the Community market certain types of steel products for a period of 7 years i.e. until December 2002. In the event of steel production ceasing in the State, there are no manufacturing quotas to be sold on.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Government Departments and the social partners certain essential services currently undertaken by participants on the Community Employment Programme (CE) will be mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for the services in question. Services in the schools sector and in the health sector are being prioritised at present in this regard.</P>
      <P>Mainstreaming will take place on a phased basis having regard to the suitability for mainstreaming of the service being provided, and with due regard to an individual's participation entitlements on CE. Mainstreaming should enhance the services being provided and provide valuable employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>I intend to initiate the mainstreaming process by transferring CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to the Department of Education and Science in time for the new school year beginning in September next.</P>

      <P>My understanding of this matter is that in 1970 the person to whom the Deputy refers gave his solicitor funds to expedite the purchase from the Bantry Estate of an area of foreshore at Castletownbere. However, despite considerable effort and expense on his part in the intervening years, it has not been possible to show that the sale was ever completed.</P>
      <P>In the absence of clear evidence of title to the foreshore concerned, it is not possible to progress the matter further. However, I have asked my officials to contact the solicitors to the Bantry Estate and to request that the estate review its files to ascertain, if possible, whether records exist of the transaction or its completion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in replies to previous questions, the Shannon Fisheries Acts provide that the ESB, in addition but subject and without prejudice to, the primary function of maintaining, working and developing the Shannon hydro-electric works, is responsible for managing, conducting and preserving the Shannon fisheries vested in it, subject to my general supervision.</P>
      <P>The ESB has advised that to assemble the information requested in relation to material confiscated over the years in question would require a major investment of resources and that, furthermore, records for many of the events may no longer be in existence. Seizures and disposals by ESB staff are carried out in accordance with the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>The ESB has prepared a synthesis report on the River Shannon Eel Management Programme 1992 to 2000. The report states that elver supplies for restocking can be obtained from the traps at Ardnacrusha and on estuarine tributaries such as the Rivers Maigue and Feale. The ESB also informs me that this year, in order to augment recruitment of juvenile eels, it contracted with a private company for the restocking of glass eels, however, this work did not proceed due to foot and mouth disease restrictions.</P>

      <P>In March 2001, under the Coast Protection Programme for 2001, I approved £200,000 for phase 2 of the coast protection scheme at Annagassan, Co Louth. Louth County Council undertook this scheme directly. The county council has recently advised my Department that this scheme is now complete and the total expenditure on the scheme in 2001 is estimated to be in the region of £145,000. The bulk of this money was spent on 580 metres of 1.5 tonne rock armour revetment, 7,360 square metres of slope re-grading, 320 metres of cut-off drain, and 1,820 metres of herring bone drainage on slopes.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Clogherhead Pier, County Louth, has not been included in the Fishery Harbours Programme for 2001, for which his Department has allocated 23 million euros; if he has received a proposal from Louth County Council in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pier at Clogherhead is owned by Louth County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development lies with the local authority. Funding of £125,000 was provided <Col N="193" /> last year to the county council to support essential safety and maintenance works.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Louth County Council commissioned consulting engineers to carry out a technical assessment of the development needs of the harbour. Their report, which examined a range of options, recommended extending the pier, the construction of a breakwater and dredging works. The cost of these capital works was estimated at that time to be in excess of £3 million.</P>
      <P>Any major capital investment proposed would require, in the first instance, comprehensive cost benefit analysis having regard to all relevant economic and socio economic factors, trends in volume and value of landings, the extent to which displacement is a factor, fleet trends and regional and local considerations. It is also the case that existing funding for major fishery harbour development work is oversubscribed. Development options in relation to Clogherhead will be kept under review in that context.</P>

      <Quest>when he will make regulations under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, which would permit local authorities to introduce effective by-laws to enable them to control power boats and jet skis on lakes throughout their jurisdiction particularly from the point of view of ensuring safety on the lakes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I will shortly be introducing an initial phase of regulations which have been developed by my Department as a result of the recommendations made by the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft. These regulations will contain national provisions governing the safe use of personal water craft &ndash; jet skis, fast power craft and other mechanically propelled pleasure craft and will take effect from 1 July 2001. In principle, the regulations will include, <i>inter alia</i>, provisions relating to age restrictions, the carriage and use of lifejackets, restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs as well as provisions relating to the careless and dangerous driving of such craft.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boats) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. 387 of 1992) will be revoked under the new regulations, thereby removing any possible legal impediment to local authorities enacting by-laws under the Local Government Act, 1994, to control the use of fast power craft and personal water craft in the areas, including lakes, under their jurisdiction. Indeed, I understand that a number of authorities have already introduced by-laws under this legislation in time for the current summer season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, it remains my intention that some legal issues which have recently arisen in <Col N="194" /> relation to the enactment by local authorities of by-laws under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, to control the use of jet skis and fast power craft, will be clarified as soon as possible by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, so that those authorities wishing to introduce by-laws under this legislation will be in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>There are normally four Councils of Fisheries Ministers and four Councils of Transport Ministers each year. The Transport Councils cover aviation, road and rail as well as maritime matters, which are my responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I have attended all Fisheries Councils held since my appointment as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in January 2000. My predecessor, Dr. Michael Woods, attended all other Fisheries Councils held between July 1997 and my appointment.</P>
      <P>Transport Councils normally involve technical discussions of issues of relevance to my Department in the fields of shipping, marine environment and maritime safety. Senior officials of my Department have represented me at all Transport Councils held since my appointment. My predecessor, Dr. Michael Woods, attended one Transport Council between July 1997 and my appointment, and other Councils in that period were attended by departmental officials.</P>

      <P>There were more than 1,000 fewer overflights by foreign military aircraft in 2000 compared to 1993. Records for 1991 and 1992, the two years directly after the Gulf War, are not available.</P>
      <P>The total number of flights by foreign military aircraft over Ireland between 1993 and 2000 was 28,286. The yearly breakdown is shown in the following table. The yearly average number of overflights between 1993 and 2000 was 3,536 and the daily average was ten flights. An increase in overflights was recorded for 1999, but the number dropped again in 2000 to 2,808. The number of overflights by military aircraft to date in 2001 is 508.</P>
      <P>Computerised records for the origin and destination of the 28,286 flights between 1993 and 2000 are not available, but the following information shows the breakdown by country of the overflights for each year.</P>
      <P>Permission for overflights or landings is given on condition that the aircraft in question are unarmed, carry no ammunition, do not engage in intelligence gathering and are not involved in military exercises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 33 of 16 February 2000 in which I stated that under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, foreign military aircraft require the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to overfly or land in the State. Permission for overflights or landings is given on condition that the aircraft in question are unarmed, carry no ammunition, do not engage in intelligence gathering and are not involved in military exercises.</P>
      <P>Foreign governments are made aware of these legal requirements, which extend also to nuclear armaments, when they apply for permission for aircraft to overfly the State. Against this background, I can confirm that no requests have been received for overflights by aircraft carrying nuclear armaments.</P>

      <P>The nature of the Irish bilateral aid programme, to which I think the Deputy is referring, has evolved significantly in recent years. In line with trends in development and with best practice among donors, the Irish programme has moved away from a project based approach to one comprised <Col N="214" /> in the main of programmes implemented by our partner governments in Africa, the aim of which is to improve their ability to do things for themselves.</P>
      <P>Out of a total aid allocation in 2001 of £188 million, the sum of £89 million will be spent on such programmes in eight countries in Africa. These countries are the six countries which are a priority for the Irish programme, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho, and also smaller programmes in South Africa and Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>In line with the shift from a project to a partner programme approach, there has been a related shift in staffing away from the use of foreign or Irish experts to implementation through partner government structures. The number of Irish experts has accordingly fallen from more than 70 a decade ago to one at present. However, in our embassies in the six priority countries and in the embassy in South Africa, there are a total of 15 Irish staff, entitled programme officers, who are charged with monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the programmes and with accounting for the programme funds. In addition, there is a small regional unit in Kampala with two Irish experts who provide sectoral guidance across all African country programmes. These are all, in addition to the diplomatic officers, acting as heads of mission at our embassies in the six priority countries.</P>
      <P>The annual report of the Ireland Aid programme for 2000 will be published in the coming weeks. It will give in fullest detail an outline of all country programmes in Africa, as well as details of other funding provided, such as assistance to UN agencies, NGOs etc.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give a report on the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA); the amount of current funding from Ireland to that body; his views on the various adverse comments regarding the activities of the fund in China and elsewhere and in particular, its support for abortion and abortion-related activities.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the largest internationally funded source of population assistance to developing countries. The fund helps countries improve reproductive health and family planning services on the basis of individual choice, and formulate population policies that support sustainable development and poverty eradication. UNFPA is wholly funded by voluntary contributions.</P>
      <P>All UNFPA's programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its governing council in 1985, stipulates that UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;. UNFPA's work is guided by the programme of action of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 to which Ireland subscribes. The Cairo agreement called on governments to provide universal access to reproductive health care by 2015 as a global human rights imperative. Ireland Aid began contributing to the UN Population Fund, UNFPA, in 1993. This year's contribution of £1 million has been paid.</P>
      <P>The UNFPA's programme in China has projects in 32 poor counties. It was requested by the Chinese Government and approved by the 36 member state executive board of UNFPA. The programme adheres strictly to the voluntary, human rights based approach to reproductive health and family planning stipulated by the 1994 Cairo international conference and unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The abolition of quotas and targets in the 32 counties was a condition of UNFPA assistance. Funds were released only after the UNFPA field office received official written communication from provincial-local authorities that quotas and targets had been removed from participating counties. It has been agreed with the Chinese Government that the project will follow all UNFPA procedures for monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Government has agreed that the project counties will be open to monitoring visits by foreigners and that county officials would be available to talk to foreign delegations.</P>
      <P>UNFPA has given repeated assurances that it does not support China's one child policy and is confident that its programme in China will show conclusively the effectiveness of complete freedom of reproductive choice. Experience worldwide has shown that the best way to influence population growth is through a human rights approach that focuses on providing high quality services to meet individual needs and desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> In December 1997, Ireland's ambassador to China participated in a field trip organised by the fund to view its programmes in China. He was completely satisfied that UNFPA was not in any way supporting China's one child policy. Following the trip, the ambassador noted that the long-term objective informing the UNFPA programme is to encourage China's family planning system to adopt a more enlightened client driven focus by demonstrating the efficacy of a client oriented qualitative approach operating within the 32 counties selected by the agency.</P>
    <P>Ireland completed a three-year term on the executive board of UNFPA in December 2000. Through its membership of the board, Ireland was able to participate directly in detailed donor discussions on UNFPA's programmes and policies and be in a position to closely monitor the fund's performance. On the basis of the information available to the Department of Foreign Affairs through this and other channels, and in the light of specific and repeated assurances received from UNFPA, I am fully satisfied that its operations are conducted in full accordance with its mandate and the principles of the Cairo programme of action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's participation in the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is based on the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as approved by the electorate in 1998, and in line with the conclusions of successive European councils. Participation in the ESDP is fully consistent with Ireland's policy of military neutrality. The Government has made clear that Ireland would only take part in Petersberg Task missions which are specifically authorised by the UN and on the basis of a sovereign case by case decision, subject to the approval of this House. This position is unaffected by the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made considerable efforts to facilitate a thorough and factually based debate on the subject of Ireland's participation in <Col N="217" /> the European Security and Defence Policy, including during the recent referendum campaign. I have endeavoured to keep this House informed of developments in this area on a regular basis, as well as through appearances at Oireachtas Committees. In this context, I will shortly be appearing again before the Joint Committee on European Affairs</P>
    <P>I remain open to debate at any stage on Ireland's approach to European Security and Defence Policy and I envisage that it will be one of a number of issues which will arise for discussion at the national forum for Europe which is soon to be established. I look forward to a fruitful exchange of views and to addressing any remaining fears or anxieties in a comprehensive manner.</P>

      <P>I missed meetings of the General Affairs Council on three occasions when urgent business has obliged me to be elsewhere. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, stood in for me at yesterday's GAC, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Ryan, stood in for me at the January 2001 GAC and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, did so at the September 2000 GAC.

I understand that she has attended each meeting since July 1997 with the exception of the meeting on 10 November 2000. On that occasion, Ireland was represented by Ambassador Denis O'Leary, Permanent Representative to the EU, and by Assistant Secretary Martin Greene, head of the development co-operation division at the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The rural transport initiative is a programme under which a number of pilot rural transport projects will be funded over the next two years from a provision of £3.5 million set aside for this purpose in the national development plan. The initiative will be administered by area development management on behalf of my Department. The initiative was developed in conjunction with the rural transport sub-committee of the public transport partnership forum and earlier this year I issued a consultation document on the subject to which we received over 70 responses. The primary objective of the initiative is to promote and support the development of innovative, community based public transport projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative will be open to community groups in all counties and I will formally launch <Col N="240" /> it on 2 July next in Athlone. The expenditure under the initiative this year is expected to be of the order of £270,000 for which there is provision in my Department's Estimates.</P>

      <Quest>if, with reference to her reply to Parliamentary Question No. 138 of 13 June 2001 to Deputy Currie, she will state the action she intends to take to provide protection from aircraft noise for the residents of Weston Estate, Lucan, County Dublin and other residents living adjacent to Weston Aerodrome; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The regulations outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 138 of 13 June 2001 are those which apply to larger commercial jet aircraft. The aircraft using Weston Aerodrome are smaller aircraft mostly engaged in training, leisure or general aviation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Weston Aerodrome has been operating as an aerodrome since 1938 and in recent years the development of Lucan has pushed large residential areas quite close to it. With a view to limiting the noise impact on residential areas, Weston Aerodrome has introduced recommended procedures for pilots in relation to the flight paths <Col N="241" /> and altitudes. However, in view of the very close proximity of Weston estate to the aerodrome and, in particular, the direction of the main runway in relation to the estate, it is inevitable that there will be some level of noise experienced by residents when aircraft take off and land. While I regret the disturbance being experienced by the residents of Weston Park, it is also clear that the planning authority has a role in these matters. I note that when planning permission was sought for the Weston estate a number of objections, including one from Weston Aerodrome, were lodged but An Bord Pleanála eventually upheld the planning permission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Government decision of 14 December 1999 authorised me to initiate a process leading to an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus. Following that decision, the necessary advisors to facilitate the implementation of the transaction were engaged. The Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, to provide the legislative framework for the IPO was published and passed through the Seanad last summer. Discussions were also initiated last year with the Aer Lingus unions on an increased shareholding of 9.9% of the company for Aer Lingus employees in addition to the current employee shareholding of 5%. While significant progress was achieved, these discussions were suspended last summer as a consequence of industrial relations problems in the airline. These problems which continued into 2001 combined with prevailing market conditions have delayed the implementation of the IPO. A further influence on timing of the IPO is Aer Lingus performance in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the background of these factors and their potential impact on the timing of an IPO, I recently requested my advisers to look at alternative sale options for the airline, take soundings of interest from potential investors or buyers and report back to me within a few weeks. It is too early to speculate on the outcome of the advisers' work. If in my judgment and that of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, alternative sale options are worth pursuing having regard to the report of the advisers and other relevant issues, a formal sale process will be implemented at the appropriate time which will be open and transparent. I have apprised the Aer Lingus unions of these developments in recent discussions and agreement was reached on the resumption of the interrupted discussions with all of the unions to which I referred earlier. The first of these meet<Col N="242" /> ings took place with departmental officials on Thursday, 21 June 2001.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides for significant investment in mainline and suburban rail and sets out ambitious targets for Iarnród Éireann in enhancing the rail network. In seeking to address the many issues facing Iarnród Éireann, a small top level group was appointed in January 2001 to assist it in facing the challenges of expanding the rail network and delivering improved services to customers. The group consists of Bill Attley, former General President of SIPTU, Kevin Bonner, consultant and former Secretary General at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and John Dunne, chairman of IDA Ireland and former director general of IBEC. This group is being assisted by Dr. Edmond Molloy, of Advanced Organisation and Management Development Ltd.</P>
      <P>The group has been asked to examine the current industrial relations environment within the company and the challenges facing management, staff and unions to achieve maximum value for the customer and taxpayer from the major investment programme in the rail system over the coming years. It will also examine the current structures, procedures, processes and practices within the company at all levels for managing the changes necessary. The group will report shortly and I expect its report will provide a sound basis for Iarnród Éireann to respond successfully to the ambitious expectations of its customers in enhancing the rail network.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>I have not given any direction, nor do I have the power to do so, to ESB national grid, in relation to the adequacy of power supplies to the national grid. Under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 sponsored by me, the Commission for Electricity Regulation is required to have regard to the need to ensure that all reasonable demands for electricity by final customers are satisfied and promote the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. The CER has recently informed my Department of measures which are being taken to ensure security of supply for winter 2001 to 2002. The CER is satisfied there will be adequate capacity to meet the needs of electricity customers given the availability of short-term generation for the coming winter period. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
      <P>In May 2001, ESB national grid published the <i>Generation Adequacy Statement 2001-2007</i> in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. I am pleased to note that in the medium term the commissioning of large-scale generation plant projected for 2002 will lead to a significant improvement in the generation adequacy position. In the longer term, assuming a properly functioning market with adequate investor incentives, national grid has stated that there is no reason generation adequacy should not be maintained within standard from 2003 onwards.</P>

    <P>On 26 May 2001, legal documentation was signed which commits INPC and the Tosco Cor<Col N="244" /> poration to completion of the proposed acquisition of the refinery and the Whiddy oil terminal by 16 July 2001 subject to certain significant conditions. These include the enactment of legislation necessary to empower me to exercise certain functions which are an essential part of the overall transaction. That legislation &ndash; the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited Bill, 2001 &ndash; passed all stages in the Dáil on 21 June 2001 and Second Stage is scheduled to commence in the Seanad on Thursday, 28 June 2001.</P>

      <P>Three directives which form part of what is termed the &ldquo;Railway Package&rdquo; were adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 26 February this year. One of these, Directive 2001/14/EC, concerns, <i>inter alia</i>, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity. Under a derogation which applies to the island of Ireland, the provisions of the directive relating to access to infrastructure would only apply in the event that an operator other than Irish Rail or Northern Ireland Railways were to apply to operate on or to share Irish Rail's railway network infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has established a number of working groups to help member states in the process of implementing Directive 2001/14/EC and the other two directives of the &ldquo;Railway Package&rdquo;. My officials are attending meetings of these working groups with a view to preparing the ground for the timely transposition of these directives into Irish law.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 125 and 127 to 130, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that the introduction of enhanced services between Dublin and Maynooth is awaiting the resolution of certain industrial relations issues, which were the subject of a full Labour Court hearing on 14 April 2001. A recommendation from the court is expected in mid July. I have also been advised by the company that the rail track beyond Maynooth to Kilcock has been upgraded in recent years, at a cost of approximately £2 million. I also understand that the provision of a second rail track beyond Maynooth to Kilcock and providing extended services will be kept under review by the company in the context of changing demands on the suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Overall during the lifetime of the national development plan, £220 million is being invested in the bus network in the Dublin area and the surrounding counties. As a consequence, both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann have expanded their fleets, increased the capacity and frequency of their services and improved the service to their customers. In total, Dublin Bus has acquired 225 new buses while Bus Éireann has acquired 148 overall. While not commenting on individual services, which is a matter for the management and board of CIE, I understand that Bus Éireann has increased peak capacity by 40% on all major routes into Dublin while Bus Átha Cliath has not only increased their services at peak hours but also extended many of their routes.</P>
      <P>I also understand that both companies will purchase further additional buses and provide additional services over the life of the National Development Plan.</P>

      <P>The procurement directives issued by the European Commission are concerned with the award of contracts by public bodies. They are framed with the <Col N="249" /> intention of allowing as much competition as possible so as to maximise participation by interested suppliers. As such, they set out rules for the behaviour of contracting authorities in the procurement process. The onus is therefore on the contracting authorities rather than the suppliers to comply with these directives. In this connection contracts are placed by my Department in accordance with Government contracts procedures and, as necessary, European Commission directives.</P>

The areas to be selected will be chosen on the principle of population decline, where such decline has been the most critical over the 1926 to 1996 period, based on census of population data over this interval. In line with the Government commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to target investment to the most disadvantaged areas, the intention of the CLÁR programme is to prioritise and accelerate National Development Plan 2000-2006 expendi<Col N="252" /> ture for State services and facilities to those rural areas.</P>

      <P>The beef task force monitoring committee is responsible for implementing those recommendations in the report of the task force relating to export promotion, price transparency, graded pricing and mechanical classification. Considerable progress had been made within the monitoring committee on the establishment of a voluntary beef promotion fund by the end of 1999 but this was put on hold following the dispute between meat factories and producers last year. As far as price transparency is concerned, my Department publishes, on a weekly basis, cattle prices paid by named individual meat factories. However, it has not been possible to secure agreement between the beef producers and beef processors on a market price transparency system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to graded pricing and mechanical classification, the task assigned to the monitoring committee is to review progress in these areas. Primary responsibility for the implementation of a graded pricing system rests with the beef processing industry itself and, while I appreciate that some progress has been made in this area, I believe bigger differentials are needed to encour<Col N="253" /> age the production of the type of high quality beef in demand on the European market. As regards mechanical classification, my Department, in conjunction with three developers from Denmark, Australia and Germany, organised a trial last year to test the accuracy of three machines in classifying carcases against the EUROP carcase classification scale and in estimating meat yield. The trial showed that mechanical classification has potential but needs to be improved if it is to replace visual assessment. Further progress in this area cannot take place until the results of another test being carried out by the EU in Germany in September are available. Experts from my Department will be participating in the pilot test.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that public funds should be provided for an industry and development programme involving capital expenditure for new facilities and the suppression of capacity which is surplus to requirements. The Government has already decided in the context of the national development plan to give priority to investments in the beef sector of this nature. An operational programme to give effect to this has been published. It is now a matter for the industry itself to come forward with appropriate projects.</P>
    <P>The recommendations relating to the need for an improvement in the quality of cattle through better breeding and husbandry practices are being implemented by Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, who have intensified their efforts to promote the development of qualify breeding by producers. However, in the final analysis, producers' decisions in this area will be based on the extent to which prices paid by beef processors reward quality production. This is primarily a matter for the industry itself.</P>

      <P>The special purchase scheme, which is aimed at supporting the market, will come into effect from 1 July. Under the scheme, member states will have the option of either destroying the beef or storing it for eventual disposal as food aid or other humanitarian purposes. However, the disposal of the beef will be subject to prior approval of the Commission in the context of the Beef Management Committee. I have not yet taken any definitive decision on this matter. Any decision to store the beef for eventual use by charitable organisations will have to take account of the level of demand, the pre<Col N="254" /> cise requirements of charitable organisations, the length of time the beef is likely to remain in store before release and the cost and controls involved in a mixed destruction/storage approach.</P>

The regulations also provide for a mid-term review in 2003 to be undertaken by the Council of Ministers on the basis of a report submitted to it by the European Commission. The stated aim of the review is to allow the current quota arrangements to run out after 2006. Since the introduction of new regulations at national level on 1 April 2000 the main mechanism for the transfer of quota in Ireland is the milk quota restructuring scheme. The maximum price of quota under that scheme in the current quota year is 27p per litre.</P>

      <P>While the final figures are not yet available, it is estimated that the total cost to my Department relating to the recent foot and mouth outbreak will be in the region of £30 million. This estimate covers compensation for animals slaughtered, preventative measures put in place to stop the spread of the disease here and administrative costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the long-term implications of FMD on the agri-food industry, the position is that on 22 June my Department wrote to the OIE, the World Animal Health Organisation, indicating that as three months had elapsed since the only case of FMD in this country, and having regard to the surveillance work undertaken, Ireland had regained its status as an FMD free country under the international animal health code of the OIE. That body will now take the administrative steps necessary to formalise the Irish position. I must point out, however, that serious difficulties remain for the beef industry as a result of the ban in a number of third countries on the importation of beef from the European Union, as a result of the BSE crisis, rather than <Col N="255" /> the FMD situation. The efforts to assuage third country concerns in relation to Irish beef have already been well publicised and I regard the reopening in May of this year of the Lebanese market for live animals, of the Russian market for beef and pork and of a number of other markets as extremely positive developments.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of providing assistance to the industry, it is not envisaged specific compensation will be paid in the context of FMD. However, various structural measures to assist industry are available under the national development plan. These provide an invaluable source of funding to those in the agri-food industry wishing to develop and diversify. In addition, it is the policy of the Government to provide the correct economic framework to allow business, including agri-business, to prosper and develop. To date this has been a singularly successful approach to encouraging economic development and I am confident that it remains the correct approach to encouraging recovery in all sectors affected by the foot and mouth crisis.</P>

My Department had hoped to hold courses earlier this year for suitably qualified individuals who wished to establish themselves as REPS planning agencies under the new scheme. Provisional arrangements had been made, but my Department had to cancel them in line with precautions against the possible spread of foot and mouth disease. A visit to a suitable farm for demonstration purposes is a central part of the course for all participants, and obviously this could not have taken place during the emergency. I have previously given an undertaking that my Department would reschedule the courses as soon as it was practical and safe to do so, and I am glad that the successful containment of the disease has now made it possible.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on five suckler cows under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme. He received premia amounting to a total of £736.95 under this scheme and an additional sum of £22.70 in respect of euro compensation. All applications received by my Department under 2000 suckler cow premium scheme were cross-checked with the cattle movement monitoring system (CMMS). This cross-check showed that one of the animals applied on by the person named was slaughtered within the six months retention period of the scheme. He did not notify my Department of its slaughter or of a replacement animal as required under the scheme's terms and conditions. He was advised by letter of 20 April 2001 that this animal was being rejected and that an overpayment of £273.47 was made. He was given the opportunity to appeal the decision within 14 days and did so. The information supplied was not sufficient to enable my Department to allow the grants paid to stand and accordingly the sum of £273.47 has still to be recovered. The extensification premium and euro compensation due to the person named on foot of his 2000 suckler cow premium application will be offset against the overpayment.

The cases involved are being checked in regard to other census dates and following this a decision will be made on whether or not the farmers involved should be considered for extensification premium.</P>

      <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions that the policy is to pay the market value of the flock, as is legally provided for. However, following representations from the IFA when the cull in Cooley was at an advanced stage, my Department accepted that certain sheep farmers appeared to have a case for review of their valuations. The Department made a commitment that it would conduct such a review along lines which were generally understood. The basis for the review was a perceived inequity in the valuations of flocks culled, particularly those dealt with early in the process relative to those culled at a later date. In line with its commitment, the Department carried out a detailed review of such cases and concluded the exercise on 14 May.</P>
      <P>The review comprised an examination of valuations on 286 files, followed by a further investigation of 182 cases where it was established that this was warranted. Valuers were requested to re-examine these files and supplementary payments, totalling £415,000 and ranging between an additional £80 and an additional £23,500, were recommended. These recommendations were accepted by the Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the valuation review in relation to the Cooley flocks was conducted in a fair, detailed, professional and speedy manner.</P>

      <P>I believe that food production methods, whether large-scale or small-scale, extensive or intensive, should be sustainable, environmentally friendly, respect acceptable standards of animal welfare and above all be safe for human health. The Agenda 2000 agreement which sets the policy framework for agriculture until 2006 has built on the 1992 reforms by taking further significant measures towards environmentally-friendly farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the measures which are being developed for the integration of environmental considerations into all aspects of economic activity as prescribed by the Treaty of Amster<Col N="265" /> dam &ndash; the Cardiff process &ndash; will ensure the sustainability and environmentally sensitivity of EU food production.</P>
    <P>I established an expert group to review quality assurance schemes in the food area and to make recommendations on how greater coherence and clarity might be achieved in this whole area for the ultimate benefit of the consumer and the food industry. The group has finalised its report and I will be making a statement on this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>In January 2000, the European Commission published a White Paper on Food Safety which proposed a strategy to achieve the highest possible standards of protection for the EU consumer. The proposed strategy involves two elements: the establishment of an independent European Food Authority and a draft regulation setting out the general principles of food law, and a programme of over 80 separate measures to be taken over a period of three years or so. This programme includes measures on food hygiene along with production, control and marketing of products of animal origin and animal health issues in relation to the production of those products.</P>
    <P>My objective in negotiating on these measures is to ensure that the highest possible levels of public health protection will apply to all food production.</P>

      <P>My Department uses a specially designed stopped restraint in its wildlife programme. The &ldquo;stop&rdquo; on the loop prevents tightening and there is also a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; on the loop which prevents loosening and subsequent escape of the restrained badger. The devices are checked every morning while they are in place and if a badger is caught, it is dispatched humanely by shooting. All badgers receive a full post mortem examination in our veterinary laboratories and carcases are checked for damage from these devices. To date there are no reports to give rise to concern about their use. My Department is conscious of the welfare aspect and alternative methods of capture, including cages and leg cuffs, have been examined but not adopted as no welfare advantage has been found with any of these methods.</P>
      <P>The badger is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and is removed for research purposes under licence issued by the Department of Arts, Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The involvement of wildlife in the epidemiological investigation of bovine TB must be ascertained to determine policy in dealing with the outbreak. My Department is currently committed to developing a vaccine for badgers and research into this has already begun.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of this Government that every export market should be open to Irish beef and no effort is being spared by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia to bring this about. Each of our important export markets is being dealt with in whatever way is most appropriate to the circumstances prevailing in that market. The strategy to be adopted in each case is kept under constant review by my Department having regard to advice from our embassies on the ground and from An Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>Egypt is our largest market for beef and much of our effort in recovering export markets has been focused on Egypt. I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Further visits to Egypt were undertaken by officials of my Department this year and I also took the opportunity last month to raise the matter with a visiting Egyptian ministerial delegation. Another important market is Saudi Arabia and a senior veterinary official of my Department travelled last January to Riyadh to brief the authorities there on our BSE controls. In fact, senior officials of my Department are in Egypt and the Gulf region this week following up on earlier contacts with the relevant authorities there with a view to the restoration of these important markets.</P>
      <P>Arising out of ongoing contacts between my Department and the Egyptian authorities, it has been agreed that a delegation of Egyptian veterinary officials will travel to Ireland in early August. I remain hopeful that following that the market can be re-opened.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Egyptian and Saudi authorities have a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. However, in many of our non-EU markets, and Egypt is a good example, the situation has been exacerbated by adverse public opinion as a result of sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on the BSE developments in those EU countries which encountered their first cases last year.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to Russia is that the authorities there have lifted the total ban on Irish beef imposed following the single outbreak of FMD in Ireland last March. The earlier Russian ban on six named counties remains in place. My Department is now finalising details of the veterinary certificate required by the Russian authorities with a view to the early resumption of this trade.</P>

      <P>These measures constitute an essential control on the importation of animal products from Third countries.

      <P>Animal disease outbreaks are by their nature unpredictable and it is impossible to say with 100% certainty that all serious animal diseases can be kept at all times out of any country. In some cases such diseases are the result of illegal activities.</P>
      <P>One of the lasting legacies of the foot and mouth crisis is the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, which gives officers of my Department significant new powers, and which provides for dramatic new penalties for offences under the Diseases of Animals Acts, including the seizure of assets, fines of up to £100,000 and/or jail terms of up to five years. Measures have also been introduced to regulate the activities of dealers. I am certain that these developments will have a very significant impact on some of the practices which gave rise to a particular risk of spreading foot and mouth disease in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Prudent planning and strict import controls are essential elements in keeping serious animal diseases at bay. Illegal movement of sheep has proved to be at the bottom of the introduction of foot and mouth disease on to this island. A new national sheep tagging and traceability system has been introduced and from Thursday, 21 June, all sheep must be individually tagged prior to leaving the holding of origin, and from 15 December 2001, all sheep must be tagged on farm.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will carefully examine the range of control measures remaining in place, including those at ports and airports, and that I will consider retaining those controls to the extent that my veterinary advisers think this is necessary or advisable, having due regard in the first instance to the need to prevent the spread of animal and human diseases, and also to the need for normal farming business to resume to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> At European level I consider it appropriate, in light of the FMD crisis, to review the controls applicable to animal based products imported into the European Union from third countries. I have called for such a review on a number of occasions and more recently at the June Agriculture Council, and I will continue to press for this as a matter of priority. In addition, the issues of animal transport and disease control measures generally will be considered at European level over the coming months.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the national sheep identification system it is now illegal for slaughter plants to accept sheep which are not properly identified and tagged. By law the information on the tag must appear on a label attached to the finished carcase. Sheep imported from another EU member state, including from Northern Ireland, going directly to slaughter must retain the tags inserted in their ears in the member state from which they have been imported. Imported sheep going on to a holding must be tagged with red import tags bearing the appropriate flock number and an individual number, in addition to retaining any existing tags. The individual tag numbers are issued centrally by my Department and tags are supplied by commercial operators. In addition, there are strict provisions in place governing the records which must be kept by all flock-owners &ndash; these records must show the details of all movements of sheep. Failure to comply with the various requirements of this system will attract penalties provided for in the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 to 2001.</P>

      <P>I would point out that primary responsibility for teachers' pensions rests with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister for Education and Science that the payments referred to in this case are qualification allowances payable to qualified teachers who do not hold degrees, the long service allowance and the restructured scales of principals' and deputy principals' allowance. With effect from 1 July 1994, qualified teachers who do not hold degrees were given the benefit of degree allowances payable to teachers who hold degrees. The long service allowance is payable, on a pilot basis, to teachers with 35 years of service with effect from 1 August 1996. These allowances are only payable to teachers serving on the date on which they were introduced. The restructured scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowance are payable with effect from 1 September 1996 and increases arising from changes in the system used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance are only payable to teachers who retired after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> In November 1997 the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the PCW would apply on the basis of pensions parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates. Following this decision, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines to Departments and other agencies to assist them in implementing that decision in relation to the groups of public service pensioners for which they were responsible. The Department of Education and Science has confirmed that it processed the increases which are the subject of this question in accordance with those guidelines.</P>

    <P>The difference results from the move to widen the standard tax rate band which was initiated in budget 2000. For a married couple with both spouses working the standard tax rate band is set at £40,000 which is double that of a single person. The £40,000 band for the two income couple is transferable from one earning spouse to the other, subject to a maximum band of £29,000 for either spouse. The £29,000 limit arises from the fact that this is the maximum band that currently applies in the case of married one income couples.</P>
    <P>In the case of couple A, the standard tax rate band is £29,000 increased by an amount equal to the wife's income, £15,000, restricted to £11,000. That is £29,000 plus £11,000 is equal to the £40,000 standard rate band. In the case of couple B, the standard tax rate band is £29,000 plus an <Col N="281" /> amount equal to the wife's income £8,000, that is £37,000.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the policy of widening of the standard rate band and putting it on a per person basis, which commenced in budget 2000, is designed primarily to meet the objective set out in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium that 80% of taxpayers should not pay tax at the higher rate. Given the move to the tax credit system this objective could be realised only by widening the standard rate band. The best way of achieving this objective was by restructuring the band so that persons are taxed on what they earn as individuals regardless of whether they are single or married. This policy will also make re-entering the workforce more attractive for a non-earning spouse.</P>
    <P>As a result of the changes made in the band structure, the proportion of income earners on the higher rate will fall this year to 23%. The widening of the standard rate band is one of the main elements of the substantial programme for tax reductions and reform which the Government has undertaken and does not lead to any taxpayer paying more tax.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness generally supports the Government's programme of tax reform. I draw the Deputy's attention in particular to section 1.1.4 relating to band widening which provides as follows:</P>
    <P>The social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. They also agree that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in the light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to proceed with the policy of establishing a single standard rate band for all individual taxpayers to secure the objectives which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>The design of the scheme has been prepared following extensive discussions over a long period with the local authorities in Clonmel and on foot of scheme criteria selected by them. The preparation of the scheme environmental impact statement involved consultation with a wide range of local interests including statutory, governmental and non-governmental organisations and individual groups in the area. Sufficient funds have been provided to bring the scheme to this stage.</P>
      <P>The allocation of moneys to carry out the scheme works cannot be finalised until the scheme completes the statutory exhibition and any suggested amendments have been taken on board and the extent of works defined.</P>

      <P>Correspondence, which raised a number of detailed points, in this matter was received in my Department on 8 June and a reply was issued on 25 June. The detailed nature of the correspondence necessitated consultation with the Central Bank to ensure an accurate reply was issued.</P>
      <P>The reply gave a background to the need for a new regulatory regime as set down in the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Insurance Act, 2000. The reply also responded to the concerns expressed regarding the proposed new conduct of business rules which had been widely circulated as part of a consultation process. It was highlighted that these new rules, especially in the area of cold calling had not yet been finalised and that the Central Bank would re-examine them in the light of responses received from the industry. This re-examination is continuing and revised versions will be published in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The reply also adverted to the need for appropriate consumer protection provisions by means of improved supervision. The new regime should help to ensure that all financial intermediaries treat their clients in a responsible manner and lessen the possibility of the misuse of client funds.</P>
      <P>While insurance intermediaries are now regulated by the Central Bank, policy issues in regard to the insurance sector are the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>Under tax law pensions are liable to income tax. The taxpayer has an Irish Airlines pension and a social welfare widow's pension. Both pensions are liable to income tax. The tax on both pensions is deducted from the Irish Airlines pension under PAYE. The taxpayer's social welfare pension is paid without tax being deducted. The taxpayer has tax credits of £70 per month. This means that no tax is deducted from the first £350 of her monthly Irish Airlines pension. Tax at the standard rate of 20% is deducted from her Irish Airlines pension in excess of £350 per month.</P>

      <P>Any incentive, whether tax or grant, is available only if one carries out the action necessary to obtain it. In recent years I have done my best to put as many people as possible in a position where they can save through a general improvement in the economy and consequent rise in living standards. The scheme is a general one and seeks to encompass everyone over 18 years in the State. While not everyone will participate, for various reasons, this does not negate the scheme. As far as is practicable I have done my best to make the scheme accessible by requiring that as little as £2.50 per week must be saved by an individual to qualify for participation in a special savings incentive account. A number of deposit taking institutions are offering products which facilitate the small saver in this regard.</P>
      <P>Moreover, providing that a standard rate of tax credit is available to everyone, irrespective of his or her tax position, means that every saver who saves the same amount will get the same benefit. The amount per month saved that can benefit is also limited. Other proposals put to me before the introduction of the scheme would have featured marginal rate relief or limits on type of investments, features likely to be of more benefit to the better off. In arranging the scheme, features have been built in to ensure it had broad appeal and benefit.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation's call for capital allowances for nursing homes to be ring-fenced to profits generated within the sector by those actively engaged in the industry, on the basis that quality of care may not be met by passive investors.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the quality of care rests, in the first instance, with the health boards and ultimately with my Department. I am satisfied that the capital allowances provision which I introduced in budget 1998 for investment in nursing homes are an appropriate measure specifically designed to increase the supply of nursing home places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of those investors actively engaged in the industry, there is no limit on the use of the <Col N="285" /> capital allowances. Individual passive investors may offset only a maximum of £25,000 against non-rental income. The nursing homes in question must be registered with a health board in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. If the Deputy or the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation are aware of any case where these standards are not being complied with, either the relevant health board or my Department should be contacted.</P>

    <P>Bunaíodh Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí sa bhliain 1971 faoi choimirce na Roinne Airgeadais chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Státchóras sa chaoi go mbeadh Státseirbhísigh in ann seirbhís as Gaeilge a thairiscint agus a chur ar fáil don phobal. Anois, áfach, agus muid ag saothrú i ré na Bainistíochta Stráiteiseach, agus go háithrithe sa chomhthéacs go bhfuil Seirbhís Fhiúntach Custaiméara á sholáthar, is léir go bhfuil ról ar leith ag Gaeleagras le Polasaí an Dátheangachais a chur chun cinn trí thraenáil chuí a chur ar fáil ionas go mbeidh sé ar chumas Ranna/Oifigí seirbhís fhiúntach trí Ghaeilge a sholáthar.</P>
    <P>Is iad na cúrsaí teanga atá á reáchtáil ag Gaeleagras faoi láthair: Bunchúrsaí, Meánchúrsaí agus Árdchúrsaí &ndash; lae agus oíche; Sainchúrsaí do Theileafónaithe, Fáilteoirí agus Clóscríobhaithe; Cúrsaí i Scríobh na Gaeilge agus béim ar Ghaeilge na hOifige; Cúrsaí Scoláireachtaí Gaeltachta; Dianchúrsaí Oiliúna Teanga d'oifigigh atá ag freastal ar phobal na Gaeltachta agus ar lucht na <Col N="286" /> Gaeilge i gcoitinne; Cúrsaí inmheánach sna Ranna; Cúrsaí Ilscileanna Cumarsáide agus Cúrsaí Teanglainne.</P>
    <P>Cuireann Gaeleagras seirbhís aistriúcháin ar fáil freisin agus tá siad toilteannach gach cúnamh a thabhairt d'aon Roinn d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a thairiscint agus a chur ar fáil don phobal.</P>

I am not responsible for any charges made by other countries or for any other charges levied by airlines, airport operators or municipal or other authorities.</P>

      <P>There have been 45 formal meetings of ECOFIN since July 1997 and I have attended all of these meetings. In addition, there have been nine informal meetings of ECOFIN ministers since July 1997 and I have attended all of these meetings.</P>

      <Col N="287" /> It is normal for Ireland to be represented at the Budget Council by a Minister of State and I have continued with this practice.</P>
    <P>ECOFIN Ministers can take part in the working sessions of the European Council at the invitation of the Presidency, alongside heads of State or Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs. This has been the case on ten occasions since July 1997 and I have attended all of these European Council meetings.</P>

      <P>I have not received any such representations to date. As I have pointed out before, VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer, especially given this Government's strategy of reducing other taxes such as PAYE and corporation tax.</P>
      <P>VRT is paid on initial registration and any concession to one category of vehicle will only lead to similar requests from other groups. Accordingly, I have no plans to reduce the VRT on mourning vehicles and-or chauffeur driven limousines used by funeral directors.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department recently gave approval to the South Eastern Health Board for the establishment of the project team to prepare a planning brief for phase 2 of the development at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.</P>
      <P>At present a tender report for phase 1 of the works at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, is being examined by officials from my Department. Phase 1 includes a new 20 bed unit for elderly infirm patients, a 25 place day care centre and 12 independent living units and respite care places for the physically disabled. Phase 2 developments will include refurbishment of the existing hospital and a new extension to the main building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>Services for eligible patients at Naas General Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naas has a 95 bed acute general hospital which also has 13 observation beds attached to its acci<Col N="293" /> dent and emergency department. I am pleased to inform the Deputies that capital funding of £45 million is being provided under the national development plan to meet the cost of phase 2 of the major re-development of the hospital.</P>
    <P>On completion of phase 2, the hospital bed complement will increase to 189 beds, including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the acute psychiatric unit provided under phase 1.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 of the development programme is under way, although I am advised by the authority that the development works are approximately 19 weeks behind schedule. This delay has arisen due to inclement weather over the winter period, staff resourcing difficulties and site staff industrial action. Every effort is being made to bring the project back on schedule. Substantial high quality interim temporary accommodation has been put in place, following consultation with staff, to facilitate the development works.</P>
    <P>I am aware that staff at the hospital recently engaged in an unofficial protest to highlight overcrowding conditions at Naas General Hospital. I am confident that hospital management and staff will continue to work together to respond to any difficulties presenting and ensure that a high quality service continues to be provided to patients in the best working conditions possible, pending the completion of the major development works which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is primarily focused on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms.</P>
    <P>The question of providing additional funding to the ERHA, including Naas General Hospital, will be considered in the context of funding available and other competing demands.</P>

      <P>As I have previously advised the Deputy on a number of occasions, the expert review group has indicated that it anticipates that its work will be completed in a number of months. It is not possible to give an exact date for completion due to the importance and complexity of the work. I have been assured that the group is working as expeditiously as possible and that there is no undue delay in its work. I am looking forward to receiving the report which I will consider in due course.</P>

      <P>The recently published report of the Medical Manpower Forum recommends significant increases in the number of hospital consultants in order to provide a consultant delivered service.

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. First, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and, second, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. It was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees <Col N="297" /> charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
    <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, £90, £120 and £150, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April.</P>
    <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the issue of paying enhanced subventions has been raised in the Southern Health Board area. In this regard, officials of my Department are in regular contact with the board's officials to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When the Government came to office in 1997 the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the course of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, considerable developments have taken place in cancer care and treatment since the commencement of the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997. To date over £60 million has been invested in developing cancer services. One of the major elements of the implementation of the strategy was the introduction of a national breast screening programme.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was launched last October. Phase 1 of the programme has commenced in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board. This scheme offers free mammography to women aged between 50 and 64 years living in those areas.</P>
      <P>At present, BreastCheck has two static units and one mobile unit. The static units are based on the campus of the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and on the campus of St. Vincent's University Hospital. At present one mobile screening unit operates at a local level in country areas covered by the programme.</P>
      <P>Symptomatic breast cancer services are being developed in the context of the recommendations of the report of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum. The development of these services in the NEHB area will be discussed at a special health board meeting to be held in early July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of services to meet the particular needs of patients with the objective of helping patients return to normal life in the community. In the light of this, a large element of rehabilitation services is provided on a day or community care basis. The relevant services range from specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation through such services as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.</P>
      <P>These services are often initiated in the context of in-patient treatment for another underlying illness or condition and subsequently continued on a day care basis or in the community, consistent with patients needs. Therefore, it is more appropriate to focus on ensuring that rehabilitation is provided to patients in the most appropriate setting rather than on the basis of identifying dedicated services for particular categories of patients other than those requiring specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of appropriate rehabilitation care is also an integral element of the service required by many types of patients and proposals for the development of additional capacity in the services that contribute to rehabilitation are often presented in the context of proposals for broader service developments. For example, the report of <Col N="300" /> the review group on the waiting list initiative identified that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of step-down or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>Rehabilitation services also have an important role for groups such as people with physical disabilities. Rehabilitation services in this area are provided as part of a comprehensive range of community based services. Since the Government came to office just over £107 million additional funding has been invested in the maintenance and development of services, including those for young chronic sick people who need constant nursing, respite and therapy services, and for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>I regard the continued development of rehabilitation services as an essential element of providing appropriate care to patients across a wide range of health services. I remain committed to the further development of rehabilitation services. My Department is currently considering the development of a national strategy for the development of rehabilitation services.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent increase in the subscriptions to be charged to obstetricians by the Medical Defence Union. I have met the union on several occasions in the past year to discuss this and <Col N="303" /> associated issues. It attributed the increase in subscriptions to a rapid rise in the cost of meeting claims arising from babies born with cerebral palsy or suffering from other forms of brain damage.</P>
      <P>While this development is of concern it does not have any immediate implications for the delivery of obstetric services here as the other medical defence organisation providing indemnity cover in Ireland, the Medical Protection Society, has indicated that it is willing to accept into membership any obstetrician member of the MDU who wishes to transfer to it. This development emphasises the need for us to press on with the Government's plans for reform of the arrangements for providing indemnity cover for hospitals and doctors.</P>

      <P>The two medical defence organisations have outlined in statements to the media the reasons they have taken differing positions on the appropriate rate to be charged for indemnity cover for obstetrics. In essence, they do not share a common view on the extent to which the claims experience arising from the practice of obstetrics has deteriorated over the past ten years.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparations for the introduction of enterprise liability in 2002 my Department has commissioned consultant actuaries to examine the historic cost of meeting medical malpractice claims. The actuaries have been asked to examine issues such as the adequacy of the reserves held by the medical defence organisations to meet the cost of future claims, including obstetric claims.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Midland Health Board that the Department of Education and Science runs a school for 24 persons with a moderate intellectual disability which is located on the grounds of St. Christopher's day centre, Battery Road, Longford. In addition, there is a class for five persons with severe-profound intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board provides paramedical support services, including occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy for those attending the special class albeit on a limited basis.</P>
      <P>The need for additional therapeutic service inputs to the school and special class has been brought to the board's attention by the school management at St. Christopher's and additional funding has been made available in the board's service plan for such services. Difficulties associated with staff recruitment has hindered the proposed service development to commence. Implementation of this aspect of the board's service plan remains a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am aware that, while there has been significant level of investment in recent years in health related support services, including speech and language therapy services, for both pre-school and children of school going age with intellectual disability, autism, physical and sensory disabilities, the health boards and non-statutory agencies are experiencing difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals required to deliver these services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health <Col N="306" /> boards to take a flexible approach in using the resources which have been allocated to the services, including the possibility of the purchase of additional sessions, with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services.</P>
    <P>Some work still remains to be done in finalising Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates report in relation to workforce planning for therapists. I expect that this report will be completed shortly and I am making arrangements to publish it in a few weeks time. Developments arising from the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report, together with some initial measures which my Department has already taken to increase the number of training places for certain allied health professionals, will provide for an increasing number of trained personnel for the services.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is also probably aware, section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001, amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of psychological assessments and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my <Col N="309" /> Department and is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health services in County Clare is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>A local voluntary group, the Stella Maris Nursing Home Committee, has been established with the aim of re-opening the nursing home. The committee has made a detailed proposal in relation to the possible future development of the home which would require the health board to consider purchasing the home and subsequently leasing it to a board of directors operating as a charitable trust on behalf of the local communities. It is understood that the committee has forwarded its proposal to the Mid-Western Health Board for consideration.</P>
      <P>On foot of recent representations made to my Department some members of the committee met with departmental officials on 19 June 2001. A presentation of the proposals was provided and it was agreed that the Department would contact the Mid-Western Health Board to canvass the views of the board on the proposal in the context of the board's regional requirements and priorities for services for older people. This is being pursued with the health board at present.</P>
      <P>It was also suggested at the meeting that the committee would continue to liaise with the Mid-Western Health Board and it was pointed out that the question of acquiring the home would have to be considered in the context of the board's local service requirements and priorities.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has received significant increases to funding for services for older people in recent years. The amount of additional funding has increased from £180,000 in 1997, £225,000 in 1998, £500,000 in 1999 and to £1,994,000 in 2000. The figure for 2001 is £3.573 million. In the case of the nursing home subvention scheme, the amount made available rose from £1.169 million in 1994, the first full year of the scheme, to almost £4 million in 2000. The figure for 2001 is approximately £4.5 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 to 262, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new therapies for many disorders becoming available.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the health Acts and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to such services. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups I have requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. The review, which is currently under way, has the following terms of reference: to examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
      <P>The need for additional investment in the neurological and neurosurgical service will be considered in the light of the review. I look forward to receiving an chomhairle's report in due course.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointment of neurological nurse specialists the commission on nursing recognised the need for a coherent approach to the progression of specialisation and the development of a clinical career pathway in nursing and midwifery. This function is vested in the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national council has issued clear guidelines to all health service providers concerning the process through which clinical nurse or midwife <Col N="313" /> specialist posts should be developed and approved. It is working closely with the nursing and midwifery planning and development units, which have responsibility for the strategic planning of nursing and midwifery services in a health board area, to encourage the development of specialist posts based on identified service and patient need.</P>

      <P>In its White Paper on Food Safety published in January 2000, the European Commission committed itself to laying down provisions for marketing of concentrated sources of nutrients, vitamins and minerals, that is, food supplements. Discussions among member states on this draft directive are currently at a very advanced stage. Representatives from my Department, the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland have attended EU meetings on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, food supplements contain ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibre, various plant and herbal extracts. As the task of covering products containing all these ingredients would be enormous and very complicated, the commission decided, for practical reasons, to deal only with products containing vitamins and minerals at this stage. The draft directive currently under discussion lays down a positive list of vitamins and minerals that may be used in food supplements, that is, only those vitamins and minerals listed in <Col N="314" /> the annexe to the directive may be used in the manufacture of food supplements.</P>
    <P>The draft directive does not ban vitamins, minerals and other dietary supplements intended for the prevention or treatment of illness. A product which explicitly or implicitly claims to treat or prevent an illness would be classified as a medicinal product and would require a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board before being placed on the market in this country. Such a product could not therefore be sold as a foodstuff.</P>
    <P>I welcome this initiative for a legislative framework on food supplements and consider that the proposal is an overall balanced approach. There are still some issues in the draft directive that need to be resolved at European level and I look forward to the outcome of these discussions with interest.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the drugs payments scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and it is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and significantly to improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming health strategy is reviewing the entire area of eligibility to our health services and many submissions have been made on the overall issue.</P>

      <Quest>when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will be assessed by an occupational therapist from the Southern Health Board in order to avail of the disabled persons grant; the number of occupational therapists working in this area; the number of people awaiting such assessment; the longest period that a person is currently waiting; his plans to improve the service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of housing modification grants for people with physical disabilities is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and they are provided through the relevant local authority and health boards who are involved with these grants to the extent that an assessment of the individual case must be carried out by an occupational therapist from the health board in order for the grant to be approved.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware that, while there has been a significant level of investment in recent years in health related support services, including occupational therapy services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the health boards and non-statutory agencies are experiencing difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals required to deliver these services.</P>
      <P>Some work still remains to be done in finalising Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates report in relation to workforce planning for therapists. I expect that this report will be completed shortly and I am making arrangements to publish it in a few weeks time. Developments arising from the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report, together with some initial measures which my Department has already taken to increase the number of training places for certain allied health professionals, will provide for an increasing number of trained personnel for the services.</P>
      <P>I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board with a request that he examine the matters raised and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>

Indeed, this is one of the matters referred to in the joint vision statement on the future <Col N="317" /> development of general practice prepared by the college and the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>I consider it very important that there should be appropriate general practitioner representation on all relevant public task forces, working groups and other bodies. For that reason, this is an issue that will be fully addressed in the consultative process stage of the major primary care review now under way. The consultative process stage will commence shortly.</P>

      <P>There are enormous problems in applying data from studies of medical error rates in one country to another. The findings of those studies are also the subject of critical comment in the countries where they have been conducted. In a speech to a conference in Dublin this year I made reference to the findings in those studies and suggested that they give rise to genuine concern about error rates whatever the flaws in their methodologies. No similar studies have been undertaken in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I had a number of meetings in the past year with representatives of the two medical defence bodies which provide indemnity cover for Irish doctors, the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society. As well as discussing the overall problem of the increasing cost of meeting claims, I have been made aware of the specific problems associated with the cost of obstetric claims. In relation to the immediate problem posed by the increase in the subscriptions charged by the Medical Defence Union to obstetricians, I am satisfied that the willingness of the Medical Protection Society to take remaining obstetric members of the Medical Defence Union into membership at its existing rate of £51,600 means that there is no indemnity crisis in obstetrics. The Government is pressing ahead with its proposal to introduce enterprise liability in 2002 which will substantially deal with this issue. I have also established a group to examine the possibility of introducing a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for brain-damaged infants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 284 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Representations concerning the necessity for immediate recourse to risk equalisation in our community-rated voluntary health insurance market have been received from the VHI. I consider it appropriate to state that contrary representations have also been received from BUPA (Ireland). These representations were made in the context of the passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000.</P>
    <P>I, as my record on the passage of the Bill shows, fully recognise the need to provide for effective risk equalisation in a voluntary health insurance system operated on the principles of community rating and open enrolment. The debate on the Bill, at a number of stages, included consideration of amendments which, in my view, would have significantly impinged upon arrangements for risk equalisation and I was not willing to accept such amendments.</P>
    <P>As the Bill completed its passage on 20 June, it is intended that the related regulations for a risk equalisation scheme will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for affirmation as soon as possible and I hope to be in a position to do so during the autumn. The proposed regulations, as provided for in the Bill, will be aimed at facilitating competition while ensuring that stability in the market is maintained and that community rating applies across the market.</P>

      <Quest>the reason retired personnel in the nursing industry are not in receipt of pro rata pension increases in line with pay increases for existing personnel; and if this could be included as part of the national wage agreement.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard parity criteria whereby retired nurses benefit from adjustments made to the salaries applicable to the grades in which they served before their retirement continue to apply.</P>
      <P>The Retired Nurses Association's concerns relate specifically to the senior staff nurse post, and to red circled allowances payable to deputy nursing officers, theatre night sisters and public health nurses.</P>
      <P>The senior staff nurse is a new post created as part of the 1999 nurses' pay settlement. Staff appointed to these posts will benefit from the rate for the post on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the red circled allowances referred to above, these allowances only apply to nurses who were in employment on the effective date, 16 November 1999. As pensionable allowances are only taken into account at retirement where (a) actual moneys have been paid, and (b) contributions in respect of such payments have been made to the superannuation scheme, it fol<Col N="336" /> lows that these allowances cannot be applied to pensioners who retired before the effective date.</P>
    <P>My Department has confirmed with the Department of Finance that this approach is consistent with public service pensions increase policy.</P>

    <P> I understand from the nursing careers centre that the total number of applicants for places on the general and psychiatric nursing diploma programmes in the academic year 1999-2000 was 5,591, of which 88% of applicants were female and 11% of applicants were male. Only 1% of applicants were found to be ineligible. A total of 2,062 applicants received an offer of a place and <Col N="337" /> 1,066 students commenced training in the general and psychiatric pre-registration nursing programmes.</P>
    <P>The application-selection process for places on the mental handicap nursing registration-diploma programme was handled by the mental handicap nursing applications centre, MHNAC.

      <P>Under the boarding out scheme, older people who cannot live in their own home or find accommodation with relatives, can be boarded out by the health board in family homes. Boarding out differs from welfare, nursing or long-term provision in that the accommodation is provided for a client of a health board by a private owner who has entered into an agreement with the health board to provide accommodation and allied services on an agreed basis.</P>
      <P>Article 17.1 of the boarding out regulations provides for the payment by the health board of a payment not exceeding half the weekly rate of the old age non-contributory pension to the householder in respect of each person being boarded out. In addition, Article 17.2 stipulates that the person being boarded out shall pay a sum to the householder as may be agreed by the health board, the householder and the person being boarded out.</P>
      <P>I accept that the current maximum contribution payable by a health board should be reviewed in the light of current costs and I am arranging for a number of options to be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The disruption to services at University College Hospital for both patients and staff is in the context of phase II of major capital development works at the hospital. As the Deputy is aware, this most welcome development includes radiotherapy, cardiac surgery and orthopaedic trauma, as well as additional critical care beds, a coronary care unit, a cardiac investigation suite and rehabilitation. The total cost of phase II when completed will be around £78 million.</P>
      <P>The hospital is currently surrounded by three major building sites as well as major excavation works on the grounds. I understand from the Western Health Board that there is also an ongoing process of decanting services and staff to enable progress of the building works.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the activity at University College Hospital, Galway, has exceeded its service plan. This activity has been achieved while also developing new services at the hospital such as the supra regional cancer service, cardiovascular services, acute and chronic pain services, a diabetic day care service and MRI scanning facilities.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has informed me that Deloitte and Touche was commissioned by the board to carry out an assessment of the management infrastructure in Galway Regional Hospital. I understand that the assessment has been carried out by Deloitte and Touche and its report is now being finalised. The board has informed me that the full report will be published when finalised.</P>

      <P>The senior staff nurse post is a new post which was created as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike in 1999 and that the earliest date on which a staff nurse could have been appointed to such a post was 5 November 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard parity criteria whereby retired nurses benefit from adjustments made to the salaries applicable to the grades in which they served before their retirement continue to apply. <Col N="339" /> As I explained, the senior staff nurse is a new post created as part of the 1999 settlement. Staff appointed to these posts will benefit from the rate for the post on retirement. The senior staff nurse rate does not, however, apply to pensioners who retired prior to 5 November 1999.</P>
    <P>With regard to the red circled allowances payable to deputy nursing officers, theatre night sisters and public health nurses, these allowances only apply to nurses who were in employment on the effective date, 16 November 1999. As pensionable allowances are only taken into account at retirement where (a) actual moneys have been paid, and (b) contributions in respect of such payments have been made to the superannuation scheme, it follows that these allowances cannot be applied to pensioners who retired before the effective date.</P>
    <P>These issues have been raised by the Nursing Alliance and discussions have taken place under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency. In this context, my Department has confirmed with the Department of Finance that the approach being taken is consistent with public service pensions increase policy. My policy adviser, accompanied by officials from my Department's nursing policy division, met with a delegation from the association on 9 May 2001 and explained the position to it.</P>

      <P>Information on the number of deaths attributable to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, is not available. Although colonisation with MRSA is not uncommon, it is unusual for this to result in mortality among colonised patients.</P>
      <P>MRSA is a significant infection which occurs in hospitals and in the community. There are many contributing factors, including the use of antibiotics and the control of infection in hospitals. Guidelines for acute hospitals and other facilities were developed and circulated to health boards in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999 my Department asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre to evaluate the problem of antibiotic resistance in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. On 19 June 2001 <Col N="340" /> I launched the report, A Strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland, SARI, which was produced by the NDSC. The recommendations within SARI include national surveillance programmes for antibiotic resistance as well as surveillance of antibiotic prescribing and use. The report also makes recommendations for implementing programmes to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and improve the control and prevention of infection in hospitals and the community.</P>
    <P>Health boards have been asked to re-examine and develop or revise as appropriate the infection control strategies for both hospitals and the community taking into account the recommendations in SARI and in the North-South study of MRSA in Ireland 1999. The boards have been asked to address in particular infection control strategies and staffing in both hospitals and the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to payments being made to people adversely affected by the two aspects of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report and the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, the issue of making payments will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I offer an assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the <Col N="342" /> Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Limerick area is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Patients do not pay their doctors for services under the general medical services scheme or under other State schemes such as the primary childhood immunisation scheme.</P>
      <P>Where the relationship is a private one between the patient and the general practitioner, I do not, as Minister, have any role is setting fees. The practitioner concerned is free to charge such fee or fees for any services provided in any one consultation of group of related consultations that he or she considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>If patients are unhappy either with the service provided or the fees charged they should raise the matter in the first instance with the general practitioner involved. If they remain dissatisfied on either score it is open to them to consider moving to another doctor who they believe will provide the required service at a more acceptable fee level.</P>
      <P>However, I recognise that the fee paid for any medical service, as with any other professional service, affects decisions made by individual persons in relation to accessing services. Accordingly, the primary care review now under way will address not only the extent to which preventative services can be best provided in primary care but also the extent to which the State should be more involved in funding such services to ensure better take-up.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Local authorities have primary responsibility for enforcement of litter legislation. In response to a request from my Department, local authorities have indicated that the level of litter on-the-spot fine payment is affected by a range of factors, including offenders giving false or misleading information, offenders moving address, fines being waived on compassionate grounds, lapse of the statutory period for pursuing non-payment, fine notices being incorrectly issued, and two or more fine notices being issued for the same offence, for example to a number of occupants of a house, where the local authority subsequently deems it more appropriate to accept a single payment.</P>
    <P>The period since 1997 has seen significant improvement in local authority litter enforcement performance generally. The Government's litter action plan, published last February, calls for further intensification of the local authority enforcement effort and, in particular, for improvements in performance to be extended to all local authorities. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I will continue to take every opportunity to urge local authorities to enforce the litter laws more rigorously, including taking follow-up action in relation to non-payment of fines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's involvement with funding for the disabled persons and essential repairs grants schemes relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant schemes are funded at local authority level from the authorities' own resources and within the amounts included for that purpose in the local authorities' own estimates of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recoupment by the Department to the local authority is two thirds of the grant paid. I have increased the amount of recoupment payable to local authorities under these schemes. In November 1998, local authorities were recouped 50% <Col N="348" /> of grants paid up to a maximum of £4,000 for the disabled person's grant and £900 for the essential repairs grant. Since then they have recouped two thirds of the amount of grant paid, up to a maximum recoupment in each case of £10,667 and £5,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure limits are set for these schemes in the form of capital spending allocations from the Department and are based on estimates of demand for the schemes provided by the authorities. It is, of course, open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the schemes. However, an increased capital allocation for these schemes would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by a local authority without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's own estimates of expenditure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Castlewarren scheme, the Department's analysis indicates that the projected domestic demand accounts for less than <Col N="350" /> 10% of the overall design demand for the scheme. The very high level of non-domestic demand has substantial cost implications for the scheme. Group water scheme grants are intended to assist the cost of providing domestic piped water supplies only. Additional costs relating to non-domestic supplies must be met by the users concerned.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny County Council will need to examine the design data and costings for the scheme to determine the appropriate level of capital contribution required from non-domestic users and to ensure the viability of the proposal.</P>

      <P>The proposals now being developed by my Department for the regulation and/or quality control of driving instruction involve a test of the competence of individual instructors, or exemption from this requirement where an instructor is accredited to an organisation of driving instructors recognised by my Department as meeting appropriate quality standards.</P>
      <P>The design of these standards is at present being formulated by a working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests.</P>
      <P>Recognition of particular driving instruction bodies must await the completion of this process. In principle it will be a matter for such bodies to operate on a self-financing basis.</P>

      <P>In March 2000, I increased the grant levels available for new group <Col N="351" /> water schemes, and the upgrading of existing substandard schemes, from 75% of the approved cost, subject to a cost limit of £1,600 per house, to 85% of the approved cost, subject to a cost limit of £6,000 per house. Grants amounting to 100% of the approved cost are available for the provision of essential water disinfection and treatment equipment in privately sourced group water schemes.</P>
      <P>I will review the level of group sewerage scheme grants following assessment of a pilot programme being implemented by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee to examine new approaches to meeting the waste water collection and treatment needs of rural communities.</P>

      <P>On 1 April 2000 motorcycle tax rates in three bands replaced a single rate of £22 per annum. The changes in rates for motorcycles not exceeding 75 cc, new rate of £25, and for motorcycles between 76cc and 200cc, new rate of £35, represent increases of 13.6% and 59.1%, respectively. The increase for the higher band which covers motorcycles of over 200cc &ndash; new rate of £45 &ndash; is 104.5%.</P>
      <P>An important consideration in relation to the reintroduction of a three-band system was the increase in the size of the national motorcycle fleet and an upward movement in the engine capacity of the fleet. In this respect, it is to be noted that, since 1995, there has been an increase of almost 150% in the number of motorcycles over 250cc whereas the growth in motorcycles in the category up to 75cc has been only 33%. The three engine capacity bands now introduced are intended to reflect the greater environmental impact of higher capacity engines.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person ordinarily resident in the State on 1 September preceding the coming into force of a register of electors on 15 February is entitled to be registered as an elector. The compilation and publication of the register is a matter for each <Col N="353" /> registration authority and involves the carrying out of house-to-house or other local inquiries and in many cases delivering registration forms, with notes on eligibility criteria, to households for completion. The draft register is published on 1 November and is made available for examination at post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses and local authority offices up to 25 November. Advertising campaigns at national and local levels are undertaken by the Department and registration authorities during this period inviting the public to check the draft to make sure they are correctly registered. The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force for a year on 15 February.</P>
    <P>In relation to the referendums held on 7 June last, the latest date for receipt of applications from persons seeking to be included in the supplement was 21 May 2001. Advertising was undertaken by the Department to publicise the facility, including the latest date for receipt of applications. I intend to continue with these arrangements for future polls. In addition, as with all aspects of electoral law, I will keep them under ongoing review.</P>

      <P>The current tenant purchase scheme does not provide for the sale of local authority flats to tenants. This matter was examined in the mid-1990s, when it was concluded that no practical arrangements could be made for the sale of flats that would be satisfactory to tenant purchasers. However, my Department is again re-examining the issue with Dublin Corporation to see if the sale of flats could satisfactorily be included in future tenant purchase schemes. These discussions are at a preliminary stage.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 238 of 6 March 2001. The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, indicated that, in common with a majority of EU member states, the Government does not propose at this stage to regulate for a specific prohibition on the use of <Col N="354" /> mobile phones by drivers. The safe use of mobile phones by drivers was instead to be promoted through information campaigns, including campaigns supported by the mobile phone industry.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, the National Safety Council has issued an advisory leaflet sponsored by Esat for the safe use of mobile phones by drivers. Another initiative has been a leaflet issued by Eircell and the AA in association with Esso.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the absence of a specific prohibition, use of a mobile phone that causes a driver to act in a manner which could be regarded as dangerous or careless may be prosecuted under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes, on the basis of fair compensation to landowners, has operated widely in Ireland for many years and is supported by the Constitution and a range of legislative proposals which have been regularly upheld by the courts. It is a basic principle within this process that landowners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation comprises a number of elements. The fundamental point of reference is the market value of the land. Compensatory provision is also made for disturbance, severance and injurious affection; these in certain circumstances <Col N="355" /> would exceed the land value element of the compensation package. In addition, accommodation works such as underpasses are also catered for. Where a dispute arises about compensation the matter is referrable to an independent arbitrator.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to a fair and equitable compulsory purchase process. The Government is also concerned that the national development programme should be delivered on time and cost effectively so that the country as a whole can enjoy sustained economic growth and more balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>The proposals published by the IFA for amendment of the arrangements for compulsory acquisition of land have been discussed on a number of occasions between the IFA and the Department of the Environment and Local Government and other relevant agencies, including the National Roads Authority. These discussions have taken place in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to the &ldquo;fair and efficient implementation of compulsory purchase orders&rdquo;, and these are continuing. Pending the completion of these discussions, I do not propose to comment on particular details of the IFA proposals.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons grant scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework established in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under the Act. The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is, accordingly, a matter for the local authority to decide the staffing resources to be made available, the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the scheme do not require local authorities to obtain an occupational therapist's report. Where authorities require such reports it is generally to ensure that the most appropriate works are carried out to meet the needs of the applicant and that the potential long-term needs of the applicant are addressed having regard to his or her disability. It is also a matter for the authority to ensure that there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I continue to urge local authorities to operate the scheme in a flexible and responsive manner having regard to the needs of applicants and local authorities should have regard to the availability of occupational therapist's and any likely delay in <Col N="357" /> determining whether an occupational therapist's report should be sought in any particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplements are normally calculated to ensure the person, after payment of rent has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the fam<Col N="358" /> ily circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation costs. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a rent supplement a person in the first instance must satisfy a means test. A health board must also satisfy itself that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need and that the property being rented is suitable to that need. In this regard each health board sets reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, for example, single persons, couples, lone parents etc., as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
    <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the health boards to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within the limits, the levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health board, in light of its experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>The South Western Area Health Board, SWAHB, has been contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that payment of rent supplement was stopped on the grounds that the accommodation being rented is overpriced and, therefore, not considered suitable to the applicant's needs.</P>
    <P>The SWAHB further advised that the person concerned is separated from his family and for the purpose of his application for rent supplement he was treated as a single person. When he made his initial application in September 2000 he was advised that his rent of £600 per month was almost double the maximum rent limit for a single person and was advised to seek more reasonably priced accommodation.</P>
    <P>As he had been residing in the accommodation for some time, while previously working, he was given three months by the health board to source alternative accommodation. His case was reviewed in November 2000 and he was allowed a further extension until the end of December 2000.</P>
    <P>The health board was not satisfied that he had made genuine efforts to secure more reasonably priced accommodation and accordingly on 10 January 2001 stopped payment of his rent supplement. He appealed this decision and the appeals officer decided that payment of his rent supplement should continue to the end of April to allow him more time to secure appropriate accommodation.</P>
    <P>The health board has advised that there is accommodation available in the area that is within its current maximum rent levels for a single person and therefore payment of his rent supplement was stopped at the end of April as he has failed to secure reasonably priced accommodation as appropriate to his circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Should the person concerned secure suitable accommodation the health board will resume payment of rent supplement in this case.</P>

      <P>When the person concerned applied for unemployment benefit on 28 February 2001, she was asked to provide details of her efforts to find work. Based on her response, a deciding officer disallowed her claim on the grounds that she was not available for full-time work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is receiving one-parent family payment. In determining entitlement to this payment, account must be taken of the applicants means. Under the relevant legislation, the value of property, such as land, which is not personally used or enjoyed is calculated on the basis of the capital value of the property.</P>
      <P>The person's entitlement was reviewed on 27 April 2000. She was found to be the sole owner of approximately 42 acres of land with an estimated value of £43,000 which she was not using. On the basis of her means deriving from the estimated capital value of the holding, her entitlement to one-parent family payment was reduced by a deciding officer. She appealed against this decision to the social welfare appeals office. The appeals officer upheld the deciding officer's decision, stating that it was in accordance with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person's entitlement to one-parent family payment was reviewed again recently in the light of a more recent valuation of the lands which she forwarded to my Department. On the basis of this new valuation, her means have been assessed at <Col N="360" /> £210 per week. As this is above the statutory limit of £104 per week which applies in her case, she is no longer qualified for receipt of this payment and she has been requested to return her book of payable orders. When she replies to this request, the deciding officer will make a further decision on her entitlement and if she is dissatisfied with that decision, she will have a right to appeal, within 21 days, to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special flat rate old age contributory pension &ndash; OACP &ndash; payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate introduced by me from May 2000 is primarily designed to benefit people with pre-53 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. This is a special measure designed to benefit people who would not otherwise receive a pension, though some people who <Col N="362" /> were already receiving pension based on mixed insurance, at less than 50% of the maximum rate, have also benefited by transferring to this special pension.</P>
    <P>At present 13,823 people are receiving the pension. Applications are, however, still being received and processed so the final numbers qualifying could be significantly higher.</P>
    <P>In general, all contributions paid or credited, at the appropriate rate, on a person's record are assessed when their entitlement to a pension is being examined. However, while pre-1953 insurance contributions may be counted towards the basic number of paid contributions required, they may not be used to satisfy the average contributions test. Only contributions made under the unified social insurance scheme, introduced in 1953, can be used to satisfy this test.</P>
    <P>The question of allowing pre-1953 insurance to be used for the average contributions test was examined in the first phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which was published in August 2000. The review did not favour affording full recognition to these contributions because such contributions are different in nature from contributions made under the unified system.</P>
    <P>There are currently 31,103 people in receipt of old age contributory pension aged 66 or over, at a reduced rate, excluding those in receipt of the special pre-53 pension.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a detailed assessment of the insurance records concerned it is not possible to accurately estimate the numbers who would benefit from allowing pre-53 insurance to be used in assessing a person's yearly average contribution record.</P>
    <P>Proposals to increase the level of the pre-53 pension or to afford additional recognition to pre-53 social insurance contributions would have very significant cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

They fully briefed the head of delegation on the relevant issues and on the Irish position to be taken at the meetings.</P>

      <P>The prohibition on advertising directed towards a political end is a statutory prohibition and I have no power to lift it. Section 20(4) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, imposes the prohibition in relation to the broadcasting services of RTE and section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, in relation to broadcasting services established under that Act. The Oireachtas, through section 18 of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, recently decided to extend the prohibition to all content contracts entered into by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland provided for in the Act. I have no plans to introduce legislation amending these provisions.  </P>

In accordance with long-standing custom, I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTE in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of RTE's national broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>RTE informs me that, generally, good quality reception of RTE 1, Network 2 and TG4 is available in the Inishowen Peninsula of County Donegal except in a number of small areas such as Cross, Quigley's Point, Speenogue and Burt where reception is very marginal. RTE is aware of the difficulties in the aforementioned areas and is examining ways of improving reception in them.          </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 and 343 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, terms of reference were drawn up for a task force to study likely losses for farmers in the Shannon callows resulting from the proposed conservation prescriptions. I am aware that there were subsequent difficulties with these terms of reference and unfortunately some of the farmers initially involved in the pilot study felt unable to allow the appointed consultants to commence the necessary field work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> Recently, it was suggested to me that I involve myself directly in another meeting to progress this matter. My considered view, having regard to the issues to be discussed, was that it would be more useful to arrange for officials of my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to have a working meeting with the relevant farming representatives. This meeting took place in Portlaoise on Monday, 18 June.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to be advised that considerable progress was made at the meeting, and that there have been further contacts with a view to resolving any outstanding issues. I hope that with the agreement of all concerned the task force can carry out its work this summer, and that this will enable the whole matter to be satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>I presume that the voluntary preservation scheme to which the Deputy refers is the corncrake grants scheme, administered by Birdwatch Ireland with funding from my Department. I am advised by my Department that in its view, farmers have not lost out financially by participating in this scheme.</P>

I am advised that pedestrian access is being permitted by the private landowners but they are not willing to allow vehicular access until the threat of foot and mouth has passed. I am keeping the situation at this site under review.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will appreciate that a large volume of representations is received in my office annually and that every effort is made to issue replies as promptly as possible. While I understand that a reply has now been forwarded to the Deputy, I very much regret the delay in replying to his representations in this case.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, this archaeological site is not in State ownership, but it is in State guardianship since March 1885 and is therefore afforded legal protection in accordance with the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994.</P>
      <P>The Hill of Ward archaeological site is a large earthwork enclosure and does not readily lend itself to development as a tourist attraction. Such a development in the long-term requires provision of infrastructure, roads, public access, toilets, etc., which may conflict with the protection of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made provision for the built heritage in the national development plan by providing funding in excess of £100 million for the built heritage sector. Particular emphasis is <Col N="372" /> being placed on the conservation of heritage during the period 2000 to 2006 with the capital programme giving priority to conservation and protection. This site has not been included in the current NDP.</P>

      <Quest>the progress the Garda Síochána is making in order to prevent the importation and distribution of illegal drugs; if the Garda Síochána is satisfied that successful prosecutions will follow recent seizures; if there is any noticeable non-national involvement in such importation and distribution of illegal drugs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that both the Garda Commissioner and I are totally committed to tackling the supply of illicit drugs. My policies in relation to combating the drugs problem are well known: tough legislation backed by strong law enforcement in tandem with an integrated partnership approach to dealing with the interlinked problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage. This combination has resulted in significant drug seizures, major Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled and <Col N="378" /> local communities being actively involved in dealing with problems in their own areas.</P>
      <P>The Garda is constantly tackling major drug trafficking groups and street level drug dealing, as well as dealing with the international aspects of drug trafficking. At national level, provisional statistics for 2000, indicate that An Garda Síochána seized illicit drugs with an estimated street value of almost £14 million. At local level, Garda operations such as Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Nightcap continue to prove effective in targeting on street dealing and the distribution of drugs in nightclubs and licensed premises. Provisional figures for 2000 indicate that the Garda made almost 7,000 arrests under these operations.</P>
      <P>At international level, the Garda Síochána is playing an increasingly active role through co-operation and liaison with other police forces and through Garda liaison officers posted at Europol and Interpol headquarters and also in London, Paris, Madrid and The Hague. This increasing level of liaison has resulted in a number of significant internationally driven seizures.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that in recent years there has been an increase in the number of non-nationals arrested for drug trafficking offences. In 1999, 86 non-nationals were arrested for drug trafficking offences and provisional figures for 2000 indicate that 188 non-nationals were arrested for drug trafficking offences. In all recent cases where substantial seizures have been made, prosecutions have been initiated.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána is, however, responsible for the issuance of taxi driver licences to suitable applicants. I am informed by the Garda authorities that information in relation to the number of taxi driver licences in the State would take a considerable amount of Garda time to compile and is not readily available.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of hours a person can legally drive a taxi, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a person is prohibited from driving a public service vehicle for more than 11 hours in any one day in any period of three consecutive days.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that no formal application for a Garda CCTV system has been received to date by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems in respect of Drogheda.</P>
      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. They may then be considered by the advisory committee which will make a recommendation to me in this regard. Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime/public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances/needs that exist.</P>
      <P>Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Records are not held by my Department or by the Garda authorities in such a manner as would enable me to respond to the Deputy's question in the detail requested without examining and collating a very large number of individual files, which would have disproportionate resource implications. The grounds upon which an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a person arriving in the State are set out in article 5(2) of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended.</P>
      <P>The number of persons refused entry in the year 2000 was 5,852. Some 1,373 persons had been refused entry up to 31 May in 2001. A breakdown of these figures according to the stated nationality of the persons or according to port of entry is not available. Included in the 2000 figure are 3,287 persons who claimed asylum upon arrival, were technically refused leave to land, but were admitted to pursue their applications. Since the commencement in November 2000 of the Refugee Act, 1996, persons who claim asylum upon arrival are not refused leave to land, even as a technicality, but are granted leave to enter to pursue their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 7 of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended, provides that a person to whom leave to land has been refused shall be removed from <Col N="382" /> the State by the carrier with whom he or she arrived and returned to the country of which he or she is a national or from which he or she embarked for the State. A breakdown of returns according to destination could not be obtained without examining each of the 3,938 individual records in question. With the exception of the persons referred to above who claimed asylum and were therefore admitted to the State, a person who has been refused entry is invariably returned.</P>
    <P>In the case of many persons refused entry, it is possible to make arrangements for return on the same day. Where this is not possible, article 5(4) of the Aliens Order provides that a person to whom leave to land has been refused may be detained by an immigration officer in one of a number of places specified in a schedule to the order until such time &ndash; being as soon as practicable &ndash; as he or she is removed from the State. Detention is usually for a very short period only, typically overnight. As above, it would not be possible to indicate what proportion of the total number of persons refused were detained or where, without an examination by the Garda authorities of each individual case record. The places of detention specified in the order include a number of Garda stations and prisons.</P>
    <P>The arrangements governing the removal of persons on foot of a deportation order differ from those relating to refusal of leave to land upon arrival and are set out in the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. This Act also makes particular provisions in respect of the detention of persons who are the subject of deportation orders. Failure to present oneself at a particular time and place for the purpose of giving effect to a deportation order renders a person liable to arrest and detention under the provisions of section 5 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Immigration Act, 1999 (Deportation) Regulations, 1999, specify the places of detention for the purpose of the Act and these are: Garda stations, Mountjoy Prison and the Training Unit, Glengariff Parade. In most instances, persons arrested under these provisions are detained in the Training Unit.</P>
    <P>Since removals under the Act commenced in November 1999, a total of 339 persons have been deported up to 22 June 2001, the majority of whom would have been in the asylum process. It would be possible to ascertain what proportion of these persons were detained and in which place of detention only through an examination of each of the case files held in both my Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
    <P>Records are not available in respect of the age of persons refused admission to the State. Under subsection (5)(a) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, where it appears to an immigration officer that a child under the age of 18 years, who has either arrived at the frontiers of the State or has entered the State, is not in the custody of any person &ndash; that is, is an unaccompanied minor &ndash;<Col N="383" /> the officer shall as soon as practicable so inform the health board in whose functional area the child is and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, shall apply in relation to the child. The Act also provides that, where it appears to the health board concerned that an application for asylum should be made by or on behalf of such a child, the health board shall arrange for the appointment of an officer of the health board or such other persons as it may determine to make an application on behalf of the child.</P>
    <P>In cases where a family group has been refused entry and that a group includes minors, special arrangements will be made on a case by case basis for the overnight accommodation of the minors if required.</P>

      <Col N="386" /> The Deputy will be aware that the current equal opportunities child care programme for the period 2000-06 was launched in April 2000. The funding committed by my Department so far under the equal opportunities child care programme to eight child care providers or child care groups in County Westmeath is £614,584. More than 60 new child care places will be created and the retention of more than 470 existing places in County Westmeath will be assured as a result of this funding. This funding will also lead to improvements in quality and, in some cases, allow child care providers extend their opening hours. Details of these child care providers or child care groups are outlined in Table 2.</P>

    <P>The Deputy should note that, in the case of capital grant applications, the difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out reflects the fact that payments are made in stages as work progresses. In many cases, building contractors are unable to begin work on projects as soon as had been expected due to other work commitments. In the case of staffing support applications to community based/not-for-profit groups, the difference between the amounts committed and the amounts drawn down reflects the fact that the grants are allocated over a three year period and the requirements placed on groups in relation to recruitment procedures.</P>

      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances-needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system to that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
      <P>As part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, a total of £12 million has been allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years, with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following ten locations: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001-02.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for the general policy on intoxicating liquor legislation which is essentially concerned with the number and nature of licensed outlets and the persons to be licensed, as well as the times at which, and the persons to whom, liquor may be sold. This is not an easy task, nor is it something which I undertake lightly. Any change requires very careful consideration and deliberation.</P>
      <P>The question of extended hours leading to an increase in alcohol related problems was discussed in debates on the Bill that led to the Act of 2000. While it is true that one must weigh up the consequential effects of any proposed changes, particularly if there is a question of them impacting unfavourably on the already significant problems associated with drink abuse, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the majority of drinkers have a responsible attitude to alcohol consumption and care must be taken to ensure measures aimed at curbing drink abuse do not also have the effect of penalising the responsible drinker.</P>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which came into force on 6 July last, takes account of the June 1998 report on liquor licensing by the sub-committee on legislation and security of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. The sub-committee, as part of its consultation process, invited submissions from interested persons and held oral hearings with a number of groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> As the Deputy is aware, following enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, and with a view to continuing the important work of reforming the State's liquor licensing laws, I established a commission on liquor licensing in November 2000. The task of the commission is to review the liquor licensing system in the light of all relevant factors and to make recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meeting the needs of consumers in a competitive market environment while taking due account of the social, health and economic interest of a modern society. The membership of the commission represents a wide range of interests and the terms of reference include all aspects of the operation of the licensing laws, including an examination of the problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption.</P>
    <P>The commission presented its interim report on off-licensing to me in April and I published it in May. The interim report contains recommendations on several aspects of the licensing laws including the problems associated with under-age drinking. The Government agreed that a co-ordinated response to the entire range of recommendations not relating to access to the off-licensed sector should be developed by a high-level interdepartmental working group of the Departments concerned. I expect the group to report to the Government not later than 29 June. The Government also noted my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I propose to take all the commission's findings on the problems associated with alcohol related harm into consideration in the drafting of any new legislation with a view to providing for a licensing system which will facilitate the responsible drinker but which will also provide for generally acceptable controls aimed at preventing abuse.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 381 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to target the 25 areas with the greatest concentration of disadvantage for priority investment under the National Development Plan 2000-06. Strand I of the RAPID programme has been developed to deliver on that commitment and the 25 areas <Col N="398" /> selected represent the most-deprived 5% of district electoral divisions in the country. County Kildare is not included among the areas selected for Strand I of the programme.</P>
    <P>Strand II of the RAPID Programme, providing targeted support to provincial towns under the National Development Plan, is currently being developed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, is developing a programme targeting rural decline, entitled the CLÁR programme.</P>
    <P>The areas that will benefit from the next phase of the RAPID Programme have yet to be selected under the various selection processes to be established by these two Departments, and no commitment can be given in advance as to projects which may or may not be included when the areas are selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I secured £45 million funding for an accelerated programme of investment over the three year period 2000-02 in the refurbishment and provision of new pools under the local authority swimming pool programme. The package effectively increased the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million per year over these three years.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1 January 2000 the Department provided capital grants of up to 80% of the cost of new swimming pools provided by local authorities, with the remainder 20% being financed by way of local contribution. In the case of refurbishment of existing pools the Department funded 100% of the approved costs of refurbishment works to existing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the current swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% <Col N="400" /> of the eligible cost. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available.</P>
    <P>Before submitting an application, or supporting an application from a voluntary group, the local authority have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, and that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available. This includes 20% of eligible costs of the proposal, or 10% in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Eligible costs include the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. Ancillary accommodation which directly relates to the swimming pool is also eligible for support. Additional costs associated with these facilities must be borne by the local authorities or individual voluntary group. A total of 51 proposals were submitted to my Department by local authorities under this accelerated swimming pool programme by last year's closing date of 31 July 2000. Decisions have been made in the case of five proposals and the remaining 46 proposals are at various stages of the approval process. Twenty-six of these proposals relate to the construction of new or replacement pools while a further 20 relate to the refurbishment of existing pools. While no project has been completed to date under the 2000 programme the Deputy should be aware that under the local authority swimming pool programme new pools have been built already or are under construction at Ennis, Dundalk, Navan, Gorey/Courtown, Wicklow Town, Renmore and Enniscorthy. Refurbishments have been completed or are currently being undertaken in Arklow, Monaghan, Roscommon, Waterford, Tipperary, Newcastle West and Mullingar.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 and 384 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 1,467 applications were received under the 2001 Sports Capital Programme, including 198 from County Dublin and 55 from County Limerick. While the information relating <Col N="401" /> to amounts sought is not readily available in my Department at present, I would refer the Deputies to a list of the names of all the 2001 Programme applicants broken down by county, already included in my reply to Deputy Howlin in Question No. 198 on 7 March last.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the application assessment process, I announced the allocation of £40 million on 7 June to 680 projects around the country. This allocation includes £9,571,000 to 96 projects in County Dublin and £1,531,000 to 23 projects in County Limerick, bringing total allocations under the programme for the past three years to £26.9 million for County Dublin and £2.9 million for County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I propose to circulate a list of all successful applicants, again by county, in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 388, 409 and 463 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has taken a range of initiatives to support schools in the lead up to the introduction of the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special euro schools group was set up to focus on the role of the education sector in the process of information provision and awareness-raising for the changeover, and to support the schools and other educational institutions in this process. The group comprises representatives <Col N="415" /> from my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the National Centre for Technology in Education and the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Guidelines on the introduction of the euro were issued to all primary and second-level teachers in October 2000. The guidelines are aimed at helping teachers introduce the euro to their pupils; they identify areas where opportunities exist for this process within the curriculum. A range of complementary supports and information leaflets has been produced in conjunction with the parties mentioned and further information will issue in the course of the current year.</P>
    <P>In the context of planning the implementation of the revised primary curriculum, my Department has held a number of meetings with representatives of the various publishing companies. Assurances have been received in the course of those meetings that resources currently being developed by those companies for schools, especially in the area of the revised mathematics curriculum will take account of the change over to the euro.</P>
    <P>However, apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level. School authorities have been advised regularly that textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that costs associated with the purchase of schoolbooks can place a financial burden on parents. To alleviate such burdens, my Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a grant payment is not being made to a person (details supplied) in County Galway; if, as a mature student, this person will be entitled to claim the higher education grant for the remaining two years of the course; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18498/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date <Col N="416" /> as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other that independent mature students, the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances, in any case where the student is not categorised as an independent mature student.</P>
      <P>Officials at Galway County Council, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, have confirmed that they have not received an application from the student in question. The student should, therefore, contact Galway County Council with a view to having her eligibility for grant assistance assessed by reference to the terms and conditions of the higher education grant scheme relevant to the year of entry to her course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A special rate of remuneration is being made available to teachers and special needs assistants participating in the delivery of the July programmes. In addition, extra remuneration is being offered to principals of participating schools in respect of the preparatory work involved in developing the July programmes. <Col N="417" /> Schools participating in the programme will also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of participating children, amounting to 1.5 times the normal monthly capitation rate for children with autism. Funding is also available for transport arrangements for participating children. This extension of service through the month of July will be of major benefit to the pupils concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general schools are given significant discretion as to how they utilise moneys allocated by my Department. This approach is taken in order to ensure that local circumstances and needs can be taken into account in reaching decisions on expenditure.</P>
      <P>At second level, the way in which my Department provides caretaking resources to second-level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools, and voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more in the free education scheme receive grants towards the cost of caretaking services under the PESP scheme. These grants are paid in addition to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, non-teaching staff allocations, including caretakers, are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. The way in which staffing is allocated to schools is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need. All schools in the community and comprehensive sector have the services of one or more caretakers, the full salary costs of which are met by my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools at second level now also receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. While provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund schools themselves are given discretion as to how precisely the funding is applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at primary level is that my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The 1979 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme. The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards caretaking and secretarial services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per capita grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional per-capita grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determin<Col N="420" /> ing the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>

      <P>Since taking office, this Government has made very substantial capital investment in the primary sector. For the year 2000, £81 million was allocated for primary school capital projects.

      <P>In June 2000 my Department allocated an information technology grant of £700 under the IT 2000 project to all schools which have the service of a full-time learning support and/or resource teacher. This funding was intended to facilitate the purchase of relevant hardware/software items by the teachers in question to assist them in catering for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the context of last December's budget, I secured an additional allocation of £1.75 million to fund the purchase of computers and computer aids for children with special needs in special schools, special classes and in integrated settings. This brings the total funding available in this area to £2.7 million and represents an increase of more than 100%. Since 1998, all publicly funded first and second level schools have received funding for the purchase of computer equipment under the IT 2000 project.</P>
      <P>I intend to keep the deployment of necessary resources for schools, including learning support teachers and for pupils with special needs under regular review.</P>

      <P>Learning support teachers have been allocated to individual schools or clusters of schools on the basis of the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee Report, 1993. In the Learning Support Guidelines, 2000, it is recommended that the overall number of pupils for whom learning-support teaching is provided at any one time should be approximately 30. The guidelines also advocate a high level of collaboration between the learning-support teacher, class teachers and parents in the development and implementation of learning programmes for children who are selected for supplementary teaching.</P>
      <P>The suggestions in the guidelines enable schools to design an appropriate programme of learning support teacher contact time. This programme should be designed in collaboration with the class teacher and principal to address the individual learning needs of pupils. It is, therefore, more appropriate to leave decisions regarding levels of contact time for individual pupils to the staff of each school.</P>

      <P>On 11 June last, I commenced the remaining parts of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, and launched the two new awarding councils, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. The principal functions of the two new councils are the establishment of policies and criteria for the making of awards and the validation of programmes; the determination of standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners, before an award may be made by a council or recognised by a council and the making and recognition of awards where people have achieved the required standards as set out.</P>
      <P>The Interim Review Group, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly conducted a review, in relation to the delegation of authority to make awards, in the Cork Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and Sligo Institute of Technology. Section 29(8) of the Act enables me as Minister to give effect to the recommendations of the review group as regards these institutes of technology. In this context, my Department has invited submissions from these institutes and other interested parties about certain important matters in relation to the implementation of the recommendations of the review group. Following consideration of these submissions, it is my intention to direct the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland to implement the recommendations of the review group.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme <Col N="424" /> is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. I do not consider that secretaries or caretakers employed by schools in such circumstances should be replaced by a scheme of direct payment by my Department.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 406, 436 and 459 together.</P>
      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, provides for the payment of financial awards to people who have or who have had injuries, either psychological or physical, that are consistent with abuse in childhood. The Bill is focused on children who were in residential care in institutions for which public bodies had regulatory and supervisory functions, typically industrial schools, reformatories and children's homes. These institutions were unique in their operation, management, environment and in the extent to which they had complete control over the lives of the children resident in them. The circumstances of the operation of the institutions, in particular the absence of parental involvement, and the statutory duties of public bodies to supervise their operation on behalf of the Irish people leads to a special responsibility on those public bodies and the public at large to provide reasonable compensation when people have suffered injury as a result of abuse which occurred to them in the institutions.</P>
      <P>Public bodies did not have the same level of regulatory responsibility in the case of other institutions, notably ordinary day schools which were and remain overwhelmingly privately owned and publicly funded, and had very limited authority to become involved in their affairs. In the circumstances, the Bill is confined to those people for whom, when they were children, public bodies had special responsibilities in very special circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Bill was published on 13 June and in the interests of those who suffered in these residential institutions, I hope that it can be debated and enacted as soon possible by the Oireachtas. I would like to assure the Deputies that during the course of the debate and enactment, I and my Department are prepared to listen to and consider the views of any person or group with an interest in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I regret that the letter referred to by the Deputy, relating to children under 15 who are out of school, was not answered. I will ensure that a reply issues immediately.</P>
      <P>In a buoyant economy the temptations for young people to leave school early inevitably increase and the challenge for Government is to offset this by considered and effective action. Given the vital significance of school completion for the life chances of our young people, we must continue to press for improvement in the numbers completing second level. As the Deputy will be aware this is a complex and difficult issue and one not amenable to quick fix or easy solutions.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the correct approach in dealing with this issue is to advance on a number of fronts. In the first instance we must ensure there is a proper legislative underpinning to school attendance. I see the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, as providing this. This legislation will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. Every school will maintain a school register and will enter details of every child enrolled in the school and their attendance at that school. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies to promote regular attendance and to foster an appreciation of learning among the students of a school. The strategy will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. The board will also assist schools in discharging their responsibilities under the Act. The Act will be implemented over a two year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative, which was introduced in September 1998, is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched. This marks a significant departure from tradit<Col N="427" /> ional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. In May 2000, an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative. It is also a responsibility of my Department to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties which pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>

      <P>In the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject, and at the same time by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure full credit is given in accordance with that marking scheme for the work done.</P>
      <P>My Department will again be instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner to ensure the candidate is given credit for all work done. However, in the event of the examiner encountering difficulty, he or she is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner.</P>
      <P>Every effort will continue to be made to ensure full credit is given for work presented and in 2001 examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates to ensure equity and fairness.</P>

The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grantholder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases, with the exception of all eligible mature students who, with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year, qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant regardless of distance from college. For 2000-01 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £710, respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 417 and 421 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. This has arisen because of two main factors. This Government has increased demand for teachers generally by the creation of 2,315 extra posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage. The number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges had fallen to a very low level, for example, 291 graduated in 1995. The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further postgraduate course commenced in February this year with an intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280.</P>
      <P>The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years. In addition negotiations are taking place with the colleges of education for the provision of a further postgraduate course next year. Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the Higher Diploma in Education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Edu<Col N="431" /> cational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 424 to 426, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In general, my Department is not directly involved in the production of teaching materials or educational software. However, I recognise that in certain areas of the curriculum, the market for such material in Ireland may be so small as to render commercial production uneconomic. Officials in my Department have arranged to meet representatives of Foras na Gaeilge and the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, to explore how software to support the teaching of Irish might be provided. This issue will also be addressed by the body established under section 31 of the Education Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>On the broader issue of educational software, the NCTE is actively involved in partnership with the various subject associations and with practising teachers in encouraging the production of online interactive resources in support of curricular demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 427, 428, 430 and 431 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware schools designated under the disadvantaged area scheme receive a number of enhanced or extra supports aimed at alleviating the effects of disadvantage. These supports include a number of additional teacher and non-pay allocations. My Department's Schools IT 2000 programme, launched in 1998, involved a number of initiatives designed specifically to integrate modern information and communications technology into teaching and learning at first and second levels. More than £40 million has been spent on the programme to date from central funds and, in addition, a further £21 million has been invested by public and private sector partners in the overall venture.</P>
      <P>The objectives behind Schools IT 2000 were to put in place a permanent infrastructure to ensure all students would have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and to equip themselves for participation in the information society. Another objective was to give support to teachers in developing and renewing professional skills to enable them to utilise information and communications technologies as part of the learning environment of the school.</P>
      <P>A 1998 survey of information and communications technology infrastructure in first and second level schools showed that schools in designated disadvantaged areas had, more computers than those not so designated. It was, therefore, decided to distribute the Schools IT 2000 capital allocation on a universal basis across the first and second level sectors. A later survey, conducted by the NCTE in May 2000, following disbursement of most of the Schools IT 2000 capital allocation, showed that schools in disadvantaged areas still maintained a favourable computer to pupil ratio over other schools, at first level 13.3:1 compared to 16.3 :1 and at second level of 14.7:1 compared to 20.2 :1. Furthermore, this survey demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the levels of information and communications technology skills or of participation in related training courses between teachers in schools designated as disadvantaged and those not designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, further funding of £81 million, £60 million of which is capital funding, has been provided for information and communications technologies in education over the period 2001-03. Current expenditure is <Col N="435" /> ongoing under each of the major initiatives of Schools IT 2000. Those initiatives are teaching skills, Scoilnet, schools integration project and software development and evaluation. Planning of capital expenditure is at an advanced stage in my Department and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>The funding available will be used to build on the progress to date; to augment the information and communications technology capital provision to schools; to expand access to, and use of, Internet technologies; and to further integrate information and communications technologies into school curricula and into teacher professional development. Specific objectives include the wiring-networking of schools and the development of school Internet access; the further lowering of the computer-pupil ratio; giving all teachers the opportunity to further develop the skills necessary for the integration of information and communications technologies into learning and teaching; and to facilitate development of software-multimedia resources for use in Irish schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 435 and 447 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme. The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary <Col N="437" /> schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. There are no plans at present to replace this scheme by a scheme of direct payment by my Department.</P>
    <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund. The introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 234 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 218 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and eight mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. An enrolment of 240 pupils on 30 September 2000, was required for the retention of the post of the ninth mainstream class teacher. In addition, the school has the services of a learning support teacher, a concessionary teacher due to the school's disadvantaged status and a shared home school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments.

The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 378 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 358 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has a learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher for Travellers which they will retain for the coming school year.</P>

The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question was 81 pupils on 30 September 2000. This enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has a shared learning support teacher which they will retain for the coming school year.</P>
      <P>The school in question was recently included in the disadvantaged programme Giving Children an Even Break for additional grant aid purposes. The board of management of the school was advised on 11 May 2001, that the only grounds for the school to retain their third mainstream class teacher is under developing school grounds. To be eligible for a post under these grounds the school in question requires an increase in its enrolment in one year relative to the previous year of 25 pupils with a stipulated excess of five pupils on the appointment figure. The school would require an enrolment of 106 on 30 September 2001, to be entitled to this additional post.</P>

      <P>Within the limitations of our examination system, every possible effort is made to accommodate candidates who suffer illness, bereavement or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations. These arrangements, which are put in place at very short notice, can involve alterations to the standard examination timetable and special sittings in venues such as hospitals. The National Educational Psychological Service also assists students and schools in difficult circumstances during the examinations.</P>
      <P>There are, however, significant difficulties in relation to the provision of repeat examinations. Such constraints, inherent in a terminal and externally examined examination system, are not imposed by any Minister. They exist as fact and derive from the length of the school year, the time required for holding examinations, arranging for marking conferences, the number of suitably qualified persons available to act as examiners, the necessity to provide ample time for those examiners to conduct the marking to a high standard, and the pressing requirement of having results available to feed into the college entry process which is conducted by the CAO and college admission departments in August each year. Given these constraints, our State examinations currently operate against the tightest of time-scales and to maximum capacity in delivering a high quality product at both junior and leaving certificate levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> As the Deputy is probably aware, a fire occurred in St. Laurence's College, Loughlinstown, County Dublin, during the course of this year's leaving and junior certificate geography examinations. In view of the wholly exceptional circumstances of the case, my Department, following consultation with the school authorities, agreed to operate contingency arrangements for the leaving certificate examination at St. Laurence's by the running of a further geography examination using back-up examination papers. I should explain that what has occurred in St Laurence's College is unprecedented, both because of the fact that the evacuation because of fire occurred during the course of the examination, and that the incident resulted in the loss of the examination to an entire cohort of students in the school. Moreover, the composition of the leaving certificate student group in the school, with its high number of repeat candidates, added to the unusual nature of the case. The entire cohort of geography students had their examinations interrupted in unique circumstances that were completely beyond their control.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that students taking French in this year's leaving certificate encountered regarding the aural section involving a tape that may have been difficult to hear; the number of complaints or queries that have been received in this regard; the action he intends to take in the matter; if all schools involved in the examinations encountered similar problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has an established procedure for dealing with any issues that arise during the aural tests. In all, some 10,000 aural examination sessions, involving the use of tape-recorders, take place in examination centres countrywide as part of the junior and leaving certificate examinations in Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian. While we would clearly like to have each of the 10,000 sessions executed successfully, it is a reality of this type of examination, coupled with the risk of human error, that problems do occur in a small number of cases each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key issue is that, whatever happens, my Department must be in a position to ensure that, as a cardinal principle, no candidate is disadvantaged because of some occurrence outside his or her control. To that end, my Department notifies schools each year before the examinations start about the process that applies should a problem occur during an aural session. In essence, this involves the examination superintendent completing a comprehensive report on any occurrence that may have impacted on a candidate or candidates during a test. This process of reporting also provides for input from the school authorities if they so wish. All of this is designed to ensure the chief examiner for the subject has available to them a full report of the circumstances surrounding the test that he or she can consider in the context of the work produced by the candidates. In this way, the chief examiner is better placed to assess how the conduct of the test may have impacted on a candidate's performance. The chief examiner has power to apply any adjustments to the marks awarded that he or she considers appropriate, based on the core principle <Col N="447" /> that the candidate should not be disadvantaged in terms of the final grade awarded.</P>
    <P>A separate approach applies where the complaint is of a more general nature and is not specific to a particular centre or candidate(s). An example is where candidates in general had difficulty with some of the material on the tape spoken by one of the speakers. Any such reports with what might be termed a common, non-centre specific, complaint would fall to be considered by the chief examiner in the context of the preparation of the marking scheme and the overall approach to the marking of the subject concerned.</P>
    <P>The examinations branch of my Department, where the process that I described above is being co-ordinated, has received a small number of queries and communications about the conduct of <Col N="448" /> the leaving certificate French aural examination. These are being dealt with under the terms of the procedures outlined above.</P>
