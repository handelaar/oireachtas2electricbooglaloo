    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> The Government recently approved the appointment of a second Information Society Commission as part of a new package of measures to progress the development of the Information Society in Ireland. The new commission will be in place very shortly. The remit of the new commission will be to monitor Ireland's performance, in a national and international context, in its ongoing transition to an Information Society; highlight the challenges and opportunities arising, including in the short, medium and long-term; contribute to the development of the next Government action plan; identify areas of co-operation with other countries, for example, the establishment of links with the Northern Ireland Information Age initiative; establish working groups as required to address specific sectoral issues with respect to the Information Society and develop recommendations for action; and prepare an annual report for submission by the Taoiseach on the Commission's behalf to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, the Minister for Public Enterprise and I are in the process of finalising the membership list for the new commission. We expect to conclude this in a matter of days. We <Col N="3" /> will need to contact these individuals and consult as to their availability and willingness to serve on the commission. I envisage, therefore, that we would be in a position to announce details of the membership very soon.</P>
    <P>The Information Society Commission is funded under a subhead to the Vote of my Department. The combined outturn for the years 1997-2000 is £1.7 million/2.16 million. The provision for the Commission in 2001 is £565,000/717,550.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has it taken six months to come to this point given that the previous commission lapsed more than six months ago? Can the Taoiseach share with me the concern expressed by IBEC and others that the Government appears to have lost its focus or its leadership in the whole area of e-business and e-commerce, which it trumpeted so loudly in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the time-lag was that the outgoing commission in its third report at the end of last year outlined that it believed the work it had done was completed and we should not continue in the same format. It said there should be a reappraisal and examination of what is necessary for the next few years and it felt its work of disseminating and propagating information was finished. It suggested what should be done. It said there should be consultation with the social partners, the industry and others and that has been done. The new structures effectively take account of the views of the outgoing commission, although some changes have been made since the discussions between the start of the year and Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a new Cabinet committee on the information society and an expanded information society policy unit based in my Department. This will subsume the ISC secretariat that has been in Dublin Castle for the past number of years. There will also be a new Information Society Commission. Most of the people, whom I thanked earlier for giving their time and service, are not available to continue on the commission. They gave a certain commitment to it and we are trying to secure people of a similar standing for the new commission. I hope that will be possible. There will also be a new strategy group comprising Secretaries General, charged with progressing the matters on e-government. We have taken on board the views expressed in the commission's third report. It is up to the new commission to bring that work forward. In the meantime, as I announced, the e-Cabinet project and other important initiatives continue to move ahead. Consultants have been appointed and the information society fund, which is administered by the Department of Finance, has been increased to almost £50 million this year. The fund has progressed the objectives in the action plan so there has been no delay in that regard. The work has continued. The new commission must deal with the new tasks outlined in the main by the pre<Col N="4" /> vious commission. We must also develop a second action plan and work is under way on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Taoiseach's plausible reply, the decision to appoint a new commission was only taken as a result of the questions tabled by me and Deputy Quinn. The proof of this is that the Taoiseach cannot name the new chairperson of the commission or any of the members. Does the Taoiseach accept Ireland's rating at twentieth in the international information society index &ndash; known as the ISI &ndash; is extraordinarily low for a country that aspires to be at the cutting edge of information technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is incorrect because this question has been around for months. It has been on the Order Paper for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is the chairperson?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the new Information Society Commission is not set up, although we have contacted a number of people. As the Deputy is aware, the previous commission comprised people of very high standing who were also very busy. The concept is to involve people at the top end, but such individuals are very busy. We have contacted a number of people and some of them are likely to accept. However, others will not accept because people in this industry do an enormous amount of travelling. Many of the members of the previous commission were often away although they gave their best. They met early in the morning, late at night and at weekends to try to fulfil the strategy. We will get a high level group but people at the highest level of the IT sector are being asked to give up their time for nothing. The outgoing chairperson, Vivienne Jupp, gave an enormous amount of time to the commission at practically no cost to the State.</P>
      <P>The previous commission set out the route it believed should be followed. Ireland is at the cutting edge but it is a highly competitive area. The level of investment in this area is vast. Resources are being invested in different areas. The information society fund has £50 million to spend this year, which is an improvement on three years ago when it had a tiny budget. Many projects have been advanced and it covers many Departments &ndash; only one or two Departments were involved at the start. An expanded information society policy unit can provide policy advice on developing the information society while, at the same time, monitoring the implementation of the Government's action plan. It can publish and monitor a successor to the first action plan because the work of that plan is, effectively, complete. We must also monitor compliance with the benchmarking provisions of the eEurope action plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of countries are now putting enormous resources into this area and expanding their budgets for it. We must do likewise. Many other initiatives are ongoing arising from the last report <Col N="5" /> and if Deputies wish me to answer questions on them I will do so. Not alone have we implemented the last report but most of it continues. The initiatives include training, a road show and an awareness campaign. These initiatives do not die but continue into the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Work is under way on the production of the new strategy statement for the period 2001-2004. The divisional business planning process is embedded within the overall management process of the Department and links are being developed with individual staff objectives as the new performance management and development system &ndash; PMDS &ndash; is implemented. Performance indicators for the modernisation programme have been drawn up and forwarded to the Civil Service quality assurance group for consideration.</P>
      <P>The roll-out of the performance management development system is now fully under way in my Department. The focus during 2000 was on communication and training. All staff attended a PMDS presentation as well as comprehensive training courses.</P>
      <P>A new customer action plan for 2001-04 has been published on my Department's website. Customer surveys were carried out in June 2000 and in March 2001 and the results have informed the new action plan.</P>
      <P>My Department has been involved in providing central co-ordination and impetus to the information society and e-public service agenda. Internally, it has prepared its e-strategy and is engaged in a number of eGovernment projects, notably the eCabinet project and the upgrading of the website.</P>
      <P>Work is under way on a number of human resource management initiatives, including the reorientation of the human resource function, the upgrading of training facilities and the development of a training and development strategy and the formulation of an equality policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is among the leading Departments in implementing the new management information framework. Phase 1 of the project &ndash; the formulation of a comprehensive implementation strategy &ndash; was completed in March 2000. Additional resources, including a professional accountant, were assigned in October 2000. Phase 2 of the project is now under way with the objec<Col N="6" /> tive of selecting a new financial management computer system by October 2001 and implementing the new system by June 2002, after the euro changeover. The approach used by my Department has since been adopted as a model by a number of other Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are issues which arise from the difficulty of recruiting and retaining key staff in Departments, particularly the Taoiseach's Department, being considered in the context of the strategic management initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not being considered under the SMI. However, it is being considered within the revamped Office of the Civil Service and Local Government Appointments Commissioner, under the chairmanship of the former Government Secretary. A number of new initiatives have been introduced and progress has been handled with some considerable success in the past six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The IFSC clearing house group, which is chaired by my Department, co-ordinates the Government's policy towards development of the international financial services sector. It includes senior representatives from the relevant Government Departments and agencies as well as from industry.</P>
      <P>The group oversees implementation of the Government's strategy for the development of international financial services published in 1999. The strategy sets out a vision for the development of the industry, building on the success of the IFSC. It seeks to maximise the level and quality of employment in the industry and to develop new opportunities for growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the Government's strategy is evident from the continued growth of the sector. For example, bank assets in the IFSC grew by 45 billion euros in the year to March to stand at 192 billion euros. The insurance and funds sectors are also enjoying continued strong growth. As a consequence, direct employment in the IFSC now stands at over 8,500 with many more indirect jobs also supported by the centre. The Dublin docklands continues to develop as a financial services <Col N="7" /> hub and major projects being progressed include the National College of Ireland campus, development of the Grand Canal Harbour and refurbishment of &ldquo;Stack A&rdquo; as a cultural and leisure facility.</P>
    <P>The clearing house group and its three sectoral working groups recently held an informal seminar to review progress. A number of potential new areas of growth were identified at the seminar and it was agreed that these would be explored by the industry and public sector sides in the period ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the largest employer in the IFSC is US owned Citibank, which plans to employ up to 2,000 people shortly? Earlier this year, the chief executive of Citibank, Mr. Brady, described the Government's decision to abolish the employers' PRSI ceiling as a big mistake and the chief executive of Intel subsequently described it as a major own goal. In view of these comments will the Taoiseach reconsider the decision as it seems to have an adverse effect on potential employment within the IFSC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously, and as the Minister for Finance said at Question Time last week, he is in discussions about the whole PRSI structure and we will allow that to take its course. I am glad to see that Mr. Brady's organisation, Citibank, which plays a key role in the committees, continues its successful progress. We have endeavoured at all times to address issues which will assist the profitability of his company and thankfully that company is doing extraordinarily well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 11 to 28, inclusive, and 50 to 56, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Gothenburg European Council, I would refer Deputies to the full statement I made to the Dáil on Thursday, 21 June. As I said on that occasion, at the start of the Council meeting I was given the opportunity to make a statement on the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Nice treaty. I sought to make it absolutely clear that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum should not be interpreted as a vote against enlargement and I reiterated that Ireland remains fully committed to enlargement and to the successful conclusion of the accession negotiations. I went on to say that it was now necessary for the Government to reflect carefully on how to move on from here. In that I asked for the support of my EU colleagues and their Governments. I said that the Irish Government very much appreciated their readiness, as expressed in Luxembourg at the General Affairs Council on 11 June, to contribute in every possible way to help us to find a way forward, and indeed this was restated in the Presidency conclusions. In this regard, I remain of the view that it would be premature for the Government to make any decision at this time on how to proceed, including in relation to the question of a possible second referendum.</P>
      <P>Enlargement was, of course, the major theme of the Council, and indeed of the Swedish Presidency as a whole. The clear message from our partners also is that the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice is a necessary condition of the enlargement process. The European Council confirmed that the enlargement process is irreversible. We agreed that it should be possible by the end of 2002 to complete negotiations with those candidate countries which are ready. The objective is that they should participate in the European Parliament elections of 2004 as members.</P>
      <P>Directly after the ending of the European Council, there was a working lunch involving the 15 EU member states, the 12 candidate countries and Turkey. I had numerous informal conversations with colleagues from applicant states. I also had a pre-arranged bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Buzek of Poland. One purpose of the meeting was to emphasise the particular interest of Irish business in the Polish market. This underlines the potential value of enlargement and of the wider internal market it will help achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of an official visit to the Czech Republic arranged for 13 and 14 September next, I have no immediate plans to pay further visits to the applicant countries, several of which I have visited already. However, in <Col N="11" /> addition to my contacts at Gothenburg, I recently met with the Speaker of the Czech Senate, Mr. Pithart. I am to meet the Romanian Prime Minister, Mr. Nastase, on 9 July and the President of Lithuania, Mr. Adamkus, in September. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, met representatives of all of the applicant states in the period directly after the referendum and paid an official visit to the Czech Republic last week.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other matters on the agenda at Gothenburg, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I stated in the Dáil on 21 June, these included agreement on a sustainable development strategy, discussion of social and economic issues, consideration of external relations issues, including the Middle East and the Balkans, and discussion of the European security and defence policy. Together with the EU Heads of State of Government, I attended a dinner with President Bush on the evening before the summit. At the dinner, both sides agreed on the continuing fundamental importance of the EU-US relationship and reaffirmed our core values and shared objectives, including the Middle East and the HIV/Aids crisis. In a very honest and direct way, we noted our disagreement over the Kyoto Protocol and its ratification. However, we expressed our shared determination to meet our national commitments and obligations under the Climate Change Convention.</P>
    <P>As previously reported to the House, I had a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in Gothenburg to discuss Northern Ireland affairs.</P>
    <P>The President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, visited Ireland from 21 to 24 June, accompanied by Commissioner David Byrne. While the outline of the programme had been agreed with President Prodi back in January 2001, detailed arrangements were only finalised in the week leading up to the visit.</P>
    <P>On 21 June, together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I met President Prodi and Commissioner Byrne for talks at Government Buildings. President and Mrs. Prodi were guests of honour at an official dinner in Dublin Castle later that evening, and I subsequently had the pleasure of spending time with them during the private section of the visit in County Kerry. Our discussions covered a wide range of issues relevant to the present and future business of the European Union, and to Ireland's place in it. I was at pains to emphasise that Ireland remains firmly committed to the Union and to enlargement. I stressed that while the Government needs to take the necessary time to consider how to proceed in the aftermath of the Nice treaty referendum, we remain determined to ensure that enlargement can proceed.</P>
    <P>I described the steps the Government will take to foster greater public awareness of and support for the Union, including the establishment of the National Forum on Europe and preparing mechanisms for enhanced Oireachtas supervision of <Col N="12" /> the Government's participation in the Council of Ministers. President Prodi and I agreed there is an urgent need to make the Union more relevant to the people and to enhance the sense of its democratic legitimacy.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, President Prodi came here very much in a listening mode, and had a wide range of meetings while here. His thoughts at the meeting with myself and my Government colleagues were very much along the lines set out in the major speech he gave at University College Cork on 22 June.</P>
    <P>While I keep the areas of responsibility of Ministers of State under review, I have no plans to appoint a Minister of State for European Affairs. I do not believe such an appointment is necessary. I am quite satisfied Deputy Cowen is doing an outstanding job as Minister for Foreign Affairs, including in respect of his responsibility for European Union issues. The lead role in European issues has to be played by a senior Minister.</P>
    <P>During my one day visit to Iceland on 25 June, I paid a courtesy call to President Grimsson, met Prime Minister Oddsson and addressed the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce on the factors underlying Ireland's recent economic growth and development.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Oddsson and I had a lengthy meeting during which we discussed bi-lateral relationships and Iceland's relationship to the EU. I also took the opportunity to brief the Prime Minister on Ireland's term on the United Nations Security Council and the current situation in Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Oddsson briefed me on the current economic situation in Iceland and we agreed that our two countries' excellent bi-lateral relations would be enhanced.</P>
    <P>I attended the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV-AIDS on 26 June. In my address to the General Assembly, I declared Ireland's commitment to the international campaign against HIV-Aids. I pointed out that this disease, which has already devastated so many developing nations, is progressing at a speed beyond the capacity of many national Governments to control. A properly resourced, co-ordinated effort by the international community, is the only way to protect people now and in the future.</P>
    <P>As part of Ireland's commitment to the global fight against HIV-AIDS, I announced that we will contribute 30 million dollars per year to initiatives specifically targeted at the treatment and prevention of HIV-AIDS. This 30 million dollar contribution, will be drawn from the increased contribution to overseas development aid, which is in line with commitments to reach the interim target of 0.45% of GNP on overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>In addition to addressing the General Assembly, I had a series of bi-lateral meetings with the President of the General Assembly, Harri Holkeri, the Secretary General Kofi Annan, President Mkapa of Tanzania, Prime Minister Mocumbi of Mozambique, Prime Mini<Col N="13" /> ster Mosisili of Lesotho and President Sampaio of Portugal. During these bi-lateral meetings I had the opportunity to discuss the global impact of HIV-AIDS. In my meeting with President Sampaio I briefed him on the Nice treaty referendum result and the future of Europe debate. In addition I met representatives of Irish NGOs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost a month has passed since the Government failed to get the people to ratify the Nice treaty. Will the Taoiseach explain why I, as leader of Fine Gael, have had no contact whatsoever from either him or the Government on the proposed forum that he envisages to discuss European affairs and prepare the Irish people and public opinion for the possibility of putting the question again or putting an alternative question? Has the Taoiseach given up on the idea of the forum or does he think it will be some kind of talking shop? At this stage I am beginning to reconsider Fine Gael's decision to participate in it because the Taoiseach does not seem to be serious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined here, less than two weeks ago, the Government's position on this matter and I listened carefully to the suggestions and proposals from all sides of the House. I said I would reflect on what was said in that debate, bring proposals to Government in two weeks and then talk to the Opposition leaders so that, before the holiday period, we could have all matters in place. I did that. I reflected on it. As the Deputy knows, I was away last week and I brought the proposals to Government today. The Government has cleared the proposals for discussion with the Opposition. We did not finalise them because I gave a commitment that those issues would be discussed with the Opposition leaders. The Government has completed its work on the matter for now and I will forward the proposals to the Opposition leaders, either in direct discussions or whatever way they prefer. In the proposals cleared by the Government this morning, I took into account all the views expressed here and outside the House by Opposition leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to bring a coherent Government policy to the forum, or will he allow free rein to his dissenting Ministers to express their own opinions? I have in mind, in particular, such Ministers as the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and Islands, Deputy de Valera, and the Attorney General. Does the Taoiseach see it as a forum for individual opinion, or will the Government bring forward a coherent view? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said a minute ago, the Government has finalised its proposals which were passed at this morning's Government meeting. The proposals I am putting forward for dis<Col N="14" /> cussion with the party leaders represent the Government's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an answer to the question I asked. I know it is the Government's decision which is coming forward, but will that decision involve a coherent submission by Government to the forum or will individual members of Government be allowed to air whatever view they wish, in the context of the forum? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to the forum, the Government will put a coherent position, as always. I hope the forum will be used by people to put their different positions. It will not just be made up of Government but of all the parties. I should not pre-empt the proposals, but they provide a mechanism whereby others can put their views also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Taoiseach's reply to a number of questions, did he, in the course of his bilateral meeting with the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Buzek, convey to him the decision the Government was about to make to cancel the ESB's participation in the purchase of up to eight electricity distribution companies and did the Prime Minister of Poland indicate any response to that decision? Further, arising from that, are the reports in the newspapers accurate to the effect that there were four members of the Cabinet on the Cabinet sub-committee, of whom two voted against the proposal, including the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and that he and the Minister for Public Enterprise voted in favour of it? Can he state on what commercial grounds, as quoted in the newspapers, the Cabinet sub-committee took this decision after a period in which the ESB had personnel in the field for up to six months evaluating this project and were close to making a final bid, having incurred costs of approximately £3 million to date in relation to this project? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed that matter, among many matters with Prime Minister Buzek. I told him this matter was being assessed. The ESB has put in a substantial amount of work on this. As the ESB downsizes in Ireland, because of EU competition and the liberalisation of the market, it is looking at a number of proposals through which it believes it could extend its remit in other areas, particularly in the context of the work of ESB International over the past 25 years. This proposal was by far the biggest one. In fairness to the ESB negotiators and management, it was only in recent weeks that they had seen the full extent of it. As they went through the tendering phase of the process, the full scale of what was involved began to emerge. They only got the full extent of it a week beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB management was anxious to keep going in the process but realised the difficulties involved. This was, effectively, bigger than the <Col N="15" /> ESB itself. It would tie up practically all of its investment and put back its own proposal for privatisation, or at least the share option proposal, for six years. With some reluctance the Government had to say no. The reason for that was the risk to the ESB and the fact it would tie up its investment outside of Ireland and not allow it engage in the huge amount of infrastructural work necessary here. It would also tie up a significant portion of the ESB's management. On those grounds the Government decided not to give the go ahead.</P>
    <P>There was no divergence regarding the view of the Cabinet sub-committee. We were anxious to assist the ESB as far as possible. The financial advice to the Government from all the Departments was that this was far too risky and dangerous and that moving to the next stage of the process should not be recommended. We gave our answer on the basis of the collective view from all the Departments, and all the financial advice we had available to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm what I have just heard, namely, that the advice from all the Departments to the Cabinet sub-committee, including the sponsoring Department, was negative and that on balance they were against the proposal? If that is the case, are the reports in the newspapers stating the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise were in favour of the proposal inaccurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just given the position. Everybody was in favour of the proposal. However, when the extent of what was on offer became clear from the Polish authorities, the view then &ndash; the Deputy should listen rather than nodding his head&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the extent of the proposal became clear, showing it would be greater in size than the ESB itself and would use its entire capital resources, the view of all Departments and their officials was in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was in Gothenburg he appeared in public with the Polish Prime Minister and his position was quickly and almost simultaneously undermined by his Minister for Finance who was speaking at another forum. Does the Taoiseach feel the Minister for Finance, by vetoing the ESB initiative, has undermined him further and undermined whatever assurances he gave to Mr. Buzek in respect of this investment by the ESB in Poland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has his days mixed up. My meeting with Prime Minister Buzek was the day following the press conference given by the Minister for Finance. However, I do not <Col N="16" /> think either event in any way undermined me or anybody else. On the second question, the position of the Minister for Finance on the proposal of the ESB was the same as all of his senior officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the ESB's proposed bid in Poland, will the Taoiseach take us through the sequence of events at Cabinet? I understand the decision of the Cabinet sub-committee was not the first time this was discussed by the Government. Is it not a fact that a decision was taken in principle by the Government to allow the ESB go ahead with the bid and that it proceeded on that basis and found the ground taken from under it subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say for the third time that the ESB was involved in this process for a considerable time. Even in the ten days following my visit to Gothenburg the extent of what was on offer and the financial exposure to the ESB moved dramatically forward from the briefing notes I had on that occasion from the Department of Foreign Affairs and given by the ESB. The Government on this and other projects is supportive of the work of the ESB, but the financial consideration would have meant the ESB getting involved in an operation which was substantially bigger than itself, at a time when an enormous financial capital investment would be necessary in Ireland, including work on the north-west and the western seaboard, which could not be sustained. That was the advice of all those who examined this project and it was on that advice the Cabinet sub-committee decided, unfortunately, that the answer on this project had to be in the negative. The ESB is engaged in other projects and will, I hope, be able to proceed with these because they are not of the size of the project in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Taoiseach's answers very unsatisfactory. Can he explain why the ESB was allowed to get so far into this project, the utter dismay in the ESB and statements by senior financial analysts that the reputation of the ESB, which has a presence in more than 35 countries as a vibrant and enterprising State-owned company, has been seriously damaged by what appears to be an arbitrary and ill-judged intervention clumsily undertaken by a Cabinet which appears to be ideologically opposed to an enterprising State-owned company? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government allowed the ESB to proceed with this tender and then pulled the plug once the company was short-listed by the Polish Government. That has had two effects. It has under<Col N="17" /> mined the credibility of the ESB in the 35 countries in which it operates and undermined the credibility of the Government with the Polish authorities whose tendering process is now seriously damaged because one of the five companies on its short list for the project has withdrawn.</P>

    <P>On the prospect of a further referendum, I already stated that the enlargement process cannot commence on 1 January 2003 unless Ireland facilitates that. Enlargement cannot proceed unless everybody is on board. We must reflect on how best we can proceed in this matter; rushing into a further referendum a month later is not the most desirable way to proceed. The manner in <Col N="21" /> which we should proceed will become clear sooner rather than later. Calls for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer at this point are not helpful.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Stagg, the project in question became bigger as time went on which is not unusual. Prime Minister Buzek explained to me why that happened and explained the necessity to act in Poland's best interests. The ESB, particularly ESBI, believes that as a result of EU directives, there will inevitably be competition in the market here and it will lose its market share. It feels the need to look elsewhere for business. Most European projects are of a sizeable nature. The ESB is considering a number of projects and, given its good name, I feel it will be successful. I spoke to a number of ESB executives and I am aware of their disappointment. However, they were aware of what the process entailed and are currently considering other substantial projects which, while not of the same scale as the project in question, amount to several hundred million pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan sets out a strategic framework for the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006. It provides for a total investment of approximately £24 billion &ndash; current prices &ndash; for such development. The various investment programmes have been further elaborated in the economic and social infrastructure operational programme and in the operational programmes for the Border, midlands and western region and the southern and eastern region. Of the total planned investment, approximately £19 billion is for infrastructure programmes coming within the remit of my Department, including national and non-national roads, water and waste water, housing, waste management and urban and village development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Satisfactory progress is being made by local authorities and the National Roads Authority on the detailed programming of the work required and with the planning, design and implementation of individual infrastructural projects. Expenditure on such projects in 2000 amounted to £1.75 billion, which is in line with NDP targets, and good progress is continuing to date. Imple<Col N="22" /> mentation is being actively pursued at all levels with a view to the timely completion of all NDP programmes. Implementation will be subject to a full mid-term review in 2003 and is being closely monitored.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of improved infrastructure throughout the country. A broad ranging package of measures is being pursued under the direction of the Cabinet committee on infrastructural development to support the process of implementation. These include the promotion of public-private partnerships, new procedures for improved management of projects, improved arrangements for dealing with archaeological excavations, a communications strategy to gain maximum support for NDP programmes, measures to increase the capacity of the construction industry and the transfer of certain project approval functions to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that good progress has been made to date on the implementation of the national development plan infrastructure programmes and that this progress will continue towards achieving the ambitious objectives set out in the NDP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply although I am surprised to hear he is satisfied with the progress being made on infrastructure programmes. Any reports I have read indicate that many projects have not advanced whatsoever, waste management being a case in point in that little, if any, investment has been made in this area. Spending on housing has decreased. Media and consultant reports indicate that the implementation of NDP infrastructure programmes is behind schedule and that further investment will be required in future if we are to maintain the targets set. Will the Minister of State comment on capacity restraints within the system? Constraints within the construction industry are widely recognised. Inflation is currently running at 12.5% in the construction industry. What effect will this have on the delivery of programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, inflation has not affected the delivery of programmes. No schemes have been abandoned due to inflation. However, the Deputy's concern about inflation is shared by the Government in so far as it may affect the delivery of programmes in the timescale outlined. The issue of waste management has proved problematic and we are all aware of the actions taken by the Minister to advance the waste management programme which created difficulties at local authority level. The Waste Management Bill will be debated in the House this week. Subsequent to its enactment, the Department will ask regional authorities to prioritise the elements of the plan dealing with delivery of waste recycling infrastructure and to prepare action programmes to bring these matters forward as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> The other area mentioned was housing with which I am especially familiar. We have established a four year multi-annual programme as part of the early years of the national development plan implementation. Local authorities have been gearing up and whatever shortfall might have occurred in the social housing programme activity in the initial year, which was last year, will be well made up this year. I will probably be asked to deal with this in greater detail when replying to later questions tabled on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State address the issue of wage inflation which he reported is four times the EU average? Will that not have an effect on the implementation of the plan, as proposed? The figures for implementing the plan are in 1999 prices, but since then wages have increased considerably in this area which will have an effect on its delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>To date inflation has not affected the delivery of the plan, but it is a matter of concern to the Government. A close watch is being kept on costs to establish whether the targets need to be readjusted in the mid-term review, but every effort has been made to meet the targets laid down and hopefully the fears that exist will not be realised. If they are, we will need to restructure the timescale, but that is a decision for the future. The programme is proceeding and capacity constraints in the construction industry can be met for certain of the big projects in which a good deal of interest has been expressed by large contractors from abroad, which will be needed to help us achieve the ambitious programmes laid out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's house price data are based on quarterly returns from lending institutions and, therefore, data for the exact time period requested are not available. However, the nearest available baseline figures, for the quarter ended June 1997, compared with the most recently published figures, for the quarter ended 31 December last, indicate that average new house prices for Dublin increased by approximately 90% in the three and a half year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 12 months to the end of June 1997 Dublin new house prices have increased by 27.4%. The Government immediately set about identifying and implementing a range of measures to boost housing output and to stabilise the housing market. The measures introduced have proved suc<Col N="24" /> cessful. Output in the greater Dublin area in 2000 was up 12% on 1997. Dublin new house price increases were 12.5% in the 12 month period to end December 2000, less than half the rate of increase recorded in the year to June 1997. This moderation has been achieved against a background of continuing high demand, brought about by a combination of strong economic and demographic factors, and lower interest rates.</P>
    <P>Government strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers and we have implemented a wide range of measures to achieve these ends. There is evidence that the Government's actions over the last few years have had a significant positive impact not only in moderating house price increases. For example, new house grant applications increased by 4.8% last year and by a further 8.5% in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year. The first time buyer share of the mortgage market has also increased significantly.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to monitor housing developments and to review policies, as necessary, to ensure the unprecedented expansion in housing demand associated with our economic success is met in a sustainable way.</P>

Does he also agree that while he has continued to tell us over the four years he has been in office that the rise in house prices is slowing down and that more and more houses are being built, in reality house prices have continued to increase, young working couples have been priced out of owning a home of their own and it is getting more difficult for people in good jobs to be able to buy a home of their own?

      <P>We get this continuous mantra from members of the Labour Party, especially from Deputy Gilmore. I do not know where he thinks it will bring us. We have set out to increase the supply of affordable houses. We have taken measures to take the investor out of the market as far as possible so as to increase the possibility for first time buyers to be able to buy at a reasonable price. That adjustment is taking place and that is satisfactory. As I outlined in the statistics, first time buyers are getting a better opportunity now with a bigger share of the mortgage market. That is the real test and I am pleased that is happening.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a major increase in the output of social housing and that is coming through in the number of starts this year. The number of completions this year will be practically double last year's figure across the whole spectre of social housing. People on the housing waiting list can expect to be housed within a reasonable period. If we had continued the level of output that existed prior to when we came into office, those people would not have a chance of being housed. There is an economic boom, a large number of people are getting work at home and many are returning from abroad. All these factors add to the demand for housing.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, established a revised basis for taxi licensing and introduced a range of qualitative improvements, including annual testing of small public service vehicles. The new regulations do not place or authorise any restriction on the numbers of new taxi licences which shall be granted by local licensing authorities. This new regime is already bringing significant benefits to service users and I anticipate that the benefits will further accumulate as new service providers are fully mobilised.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that it is my intention that the process of making all taxis wheelchair accessible will commence by end 2003. I have also made clear my intention to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, disabled persons and taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services for the benefit of both the service providers and the general public alike in the medium term. A definitive timescale for this consultation process has not been fixed, but my Department will finalise a consultation document in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the implementation of the new taxi regime and to the introduction of measures at the earliest possible date to facilitate a further quality enhancement of taxi services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is not in touch with reality when he talks about benefits to the consumer which have arisen from these changes. Does he accept that deregulation without any other measures to improve standards has resulted in an industry that is in chaos, inhabited by part-time drivers who drive with no reference to consumer demand, that we have lost virtually all the wheelchair accessible taxis and that the standards his Department set for wheelchair accessible taxis are not suitable for even the most able-bodied or youngest consumer not to men<Col N="27" /> tion people who are infirm or disabled? Also, despite the trebling of the number of taxi plates, the number of taxis operating has reduced. The consumer is suffering as a result of ill-timed measures by the Minister of State, whom, I suspect, knew nothing about how the taxi industry operated.</P>

      <P>Rather than jumping on the bandwagon, it would be a good idea if we were to wait for the result of the customer service assessment that Dublin Corporation intends to carry out. That can be compared with its previous assessment of 1998, which preceded the change in the regime and the liberalisation that took place.</P>
      <P>The major licensing authority is Dublin Corporation. Its customer service assessment is the most likely assessment to give a true indication of what is happening in the service. There has been more than a doubling in the number of licences. I accept that some licences of people who were driving as cosies, who had the opportunity to get their own, may not be active.</P>
      <P>We have introduced a requirement that licences must be renewed every year. The inactive ones will be removed from the system so we will be able to make a better estimate of how many people are active in the business. There has been a marked improvement, and the public has testified to this but we know there is still a need for major improvements. I have indicated that we will carry out a major quality assessment of the taxi industry nationally, particularly of that in the Dublin area. We have quite a bit of work to do in that regard. We have not finished addressing the issue. We just took the initial step of increasing the number of licences, which in itself produced a significant improvement in the standard of the service. However, we still have a long way to go.</P>

In the meantime, Dublin will need a taxi service. The Minister cannot walk away from the issue. Who is in charge <Col N="28" /> of the taxi service now? Is it the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, Dublin Corporation, the Carriage Office or the Garda?

      <P>Government proposals for major reforms in the private rented sector, announced on 5 January 2001 in response to the recommendations contained in the report of the commission on the private rented residential sector, require primary legislation for their implementation. A number of relevant measures have already been implemented in the Finance Act, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the other reforms requires new legislation, including amendments to the existing landlord and tenant legislative code, and the necessary legislation is being drafted. This work is progressing satisfactorily to date, although the interface between the commission's proposals and the existing landlord and tenant <Col N="29" /> code provisions is complex and requires careful drafting.</P>
    <P>The Government announcement in January envisaged a two year timeframe to reach the stage of enacted legislation and my Department is working to this. The private residential tenancies board will be established on a statutory basis when the legislation is enacted. In the meantime, and pending the enactment of the legislation, I envisage that the board will be set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in the autumn.</P>

The measures in the report that benefit landlords have already been implemented in the Finance Act.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State yet submitted a memorandum to the Government on the proposed legislation? Why is it taking over 12 months to establish the private rented tenancies board on a non-statutory basis? </P>

      <P>The establishment of the private rented tenancies board was recommended by the commission on the private rented sector. The Minister of State undertook to establish it on a non-statutory basis pending the enactment of the legislation. Given that all that is required is to nominate the members of that board and give them terms of reference and a budget, why has it taken so long, apart from the obvious reason that Minister does not want to do it at all? The Government does not want to provide basic legal rights for tenants in private rented accommodation. This is a landlord's Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that older people have access to housing appropriate to their needs. I have introduced a number of measures to ensure a wider range of housing options for older people, including assistance towards necessary improvements or repairs for those who wish to remain living in their homes, and the provision of accommodation, including sheltered accommodation, for those whose accommodation is no longer suitable to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities provide accommodation for the elderly as part of their social housing programmes, generally in small specially designed housing schemes linked to local community services. Beyond this, my Department has requested local authorities to construct more senior citizen <Col N="31" /> units in appropriate locations with a view to earmarking them for older people generally.</P>
    <P>Since 1988, more than 2,800 units have been provided under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme specifically for older people. Under the scheme, this accommodation is generally built with communal facilities where support services can be provided. Financial assistance to the voluntary housing sector generally has been increased, and I anticipate that over the period of the national development plan some 3,000 additional units of accommodation will be provided specifically for older people under the capital assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to assist older home owners who wish to move to more suitable accommodation. Two specific measures were announced in Action on Housing to assist such home owners. First, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has doubled, from £75,000 to £150,000, the amount of net proceeds of the sale of a dwelling which is exempt for assessing means for non-contributory pensions. In addition, the Minister for Health and Children has requested health boards to consider the disincentive effect of loss of medical card eligibility on older people who move to more appropriate accommodation. The Government has also reduced stamp duty to lower transaction costs of moving to more suitable accommodation. </P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring the housing needs of older people will be appropriately and comprehensively met over the coming years. To this end, local authority housing strategies, the national house condition survey to commence this autumn and next year's assessment of need for local authority housing will take account of the needs and circumstances of older people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My question referred to a continuum of care for elderly people. The housing options are private or public and range from bricks and mortar to a nursing home. There is a range of possible provision within that which is not funded although it is part of Government policy to provide for and support such facilities. It is a commitment in the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness and there are targets in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the only bodies providing this type of supported and sheltered housing for the elderly who are no longer able to stay in their homes and who do not want to and should not have to go to nursing homes are the voluntary or co-operative housing associations. There is little point in their providing the facilities if there is no revenue funding to ensure support can be on-site. It falls between the Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities and health boards. No one will take control of the problem as a whole. It needs co-ordination. Are there any plans to provide that to ensure the range of options for elderly people is available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made under the social housing programme. I mentioned the capital assistance scheme to provide accommodation for elderly people. Such accommodation has communal facilities. The health boards are also actively involved in providing support to the homes they provide. There is a range of other facilities to enable and assist people to continue to live in their homes, although the condition of houses is a major factor.</P>
      <P>This is an area in which I am anxious to encourage much greater use of the schemes available, such as the capital assistance scheme which has been beneficial to the older community in different localities. It is wonderful to see voluntary groups throughout the country organising the building of groups of houses for older people in their areas where they can live in a community in which they have privacy while also sharing communal facilities. Such accommodation is normally located close to services such as shops, churches and other facilities in towns and cities throughout the country. We want to see more activity in this area.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to see the coming together of groups of people who do not qualify for social housing but who occupy housing, mostly in urban areas, and who are willing to move to smaller, purpose built accommodation for older people. This would release their houses on to the market and make a contribution to housing needs while at the same time allowing the people to be accommodated in more suitable housing with communal facilities. A pilot scheme was announced in the budget to try to establish this. It can proceed where sites are available, and the Government is anxious to work out a scheme to assist people who wish to avail of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts with local authorities my Department estimates that needs have increased by 20% between March 1999 and March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Come off it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The next statutory assessment of housing needs is due to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 2002. This will be a comprehensive assessment of housing applications and will be undertaken in accordance with detailed guidelines to be issued by my Department by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 2000 was 3,207 units. While this outcome was below target, this was the first year of a four year multi-annual programme of 25,000 starts. It is encouraging that, at the end of last year, over 5,000 local authority houses were under construction, which was the highest level of end year work in progress for 15 years. This increased level of activity is borne out by the output figures for the first quarter of 2001 which indicate that local authorities completed or acquired almost 770 houses, an increase of 140% on the corresponding figure for the first quarter of last year. I expect authorities to complete or acquire some 5,000 housing units in 2001 and that new starts will exceed 7,000. With regard <Col N="34" /> to the voluntary housing sector, 951 housing units were completed last year compared to 579 in 1999. I expect that more than 1,200 units will be provided by the voluntary sector this year.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need. I have taken a range of measures to assist local authorities and voluntary bodies to expand their housing programmes and overall social housing output. This has included the introduction of a four year multi-annual programme for the period 2000 to 2003 to assist better forward planning by local authorities and to increase output. Financial resources have been greatly increased and local authorities have been given greater freedom to accept tenders. In the voluntary housing area, I have, since 1997, increased cost ceilings three times under the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government has already demonstrated its commitment to tackling social housing need by greatly increasing targets under the multi-annual local authority housing programme and providing for a projected almost eight fold increase in voluntary housing output over the period of the national development plan. We will achieve these targets in a way that is responsive both to the volume and the range of needs as well as to the necessity to secure quality social housing which will support effective social inclusion. This is in line with our policy of avoiding large concentrations of social housing in any one area.  </P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme is only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met. I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 11,000 households be met this year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of more than 50,000 households.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pursue the Minister of State on the figures. He confirmed that the figure of 39,176 applicants in the 1999 survey represents only those who sought local authority housing alone. Will he confirm that, in the 1999 assessment, a total of 50,000 applicants sought social or public housing of some form, whether it be a shared ownership scheme, Traveller accommodation or people seeking local authority housing, and that his figure of a 20% increase on 50,000 means there are almost 60,000 families on local authority waiting lists, the highest number since the 1930s?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In boom economic times there is a huge demand for housing in the public and private sectors. I have outlined the steps taken by the Government to increase the public sector housing output. Tremendous progress is being made in ratcheting up the output. There has been <Col N="35" /> extensive investment to ensure the availability of land on which to build and that the land is serviced. Enormous amounts of Exchequer funds have gone towards providing the infrastructure for these houses which are coming on stream.</P>
      <P>Private housing is built by private housing contractors and I have taken measures which are having an effect, to steer their activities more towards the needs of first time buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of housing output, will the Minister of State, who has now been in charge of housing for four years, explain why just 2,204 local authority houses were completed last year, the lowest number of house completions in eight years? Will he try to reconcile for Members of this House why, in what he calls economic boom times, we have the highest number of people on local authority waiting lists since the 1930s and last year we had the lowest output of local authority house building in eight years? Surely that is the worst record ever from a Minister in charge of housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy will agree that it is much better to have our people employed at home, if that is their wish, rather than being in a position where they had to go abroad, as was the case? The need for local authority housing fell as low as 1,000 houses a year because people were leaving the country in times that were not as prosperous as they are now. A change has come about in a very short time and there is tremendous demand for housing to which the Government is responding.</P>
      <P>I have indicated the programme which has been laid out. The Deputy asked about the number of houses built last year. Local authorities throughout the country, who are the housing authority, make the arrangements to build the houses and the Government provides them with the wherewithal. They did not respond with completions at a higher level. However, we are on a four year programme and I have every expectation that local authorities, having got the programmes under way, will make up the shortfall and achieve the four year target, which is important. I have continuously encouraged local authorities to front load the four year programme, and this is beginning to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept the Government has made such a dog's dinner of the entire housing market that there are now young working couples on housing lists who would not have been on them before? This is happening to the extent that the banks are now engaging in advertising &ndash; I believe questionable advertising &ndash; to encourage their parents and grandparents to mortgage their nursing home money to buy houses for their children and grandchildren. Has the Government any plans to roll back on its absolutely disastrous interventions in the market which effectively put <Col N="36" /> houses beyond the reach of the vast majority of the population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State appalled and embarrassed at the awful situation unfolding before the entire country whereby more people than ever wait for longer on housing lists than ever before? The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs proposes to spend £140 million per annum on rent support in lieu of rehousing because there are no houses available. This is a recurring annual payment which in five years will cost £1 billion per annum, and rising. Has the Minister of State considered his options in light of these startling and stark facts, one of which must obviously be resignation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State address two issues? First, will he agree that an assessment of housing needs once every three years is totally unsatisfactory and that, given the volatility in the housing market and the increase in numbers seeking housing, this assessment should be carried out on an annual basis? Second, will he agree the allocation of local authority housing is a very contentious issue due to the shortage of houses and that in the interests of transparency he should consider issuing a directive to the local authorities requesting them to establish a points system for people on housing lists? Some but not all local authorities operate this system on a voluntary basis. I would like the Minister of State to address that difficulty.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said in his reply that he expects to have 50,000 houses completed in the coming years &ndash; I presume he means in the coming four years. In light of the decreased output last year, has he a definite plan for the 50,000 houses or is it just another aspiration on which it is not possible to deliver?</P>

Ba shár Sheanadóir é agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé sár Theachta freisin. I congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes and welcome him to the House. I wish him many years as a successful parliamentarian. I thank Deputy Flanagan who was the party's director of elections in Tipperary South and ran such an effective campaign. I also thank and congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes's family, including his wife, his sons, his mother, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews, all of whom are present today. I also thank the Fine Gael organisation in Tipperary South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> The principal victors in the by-election are the people of Tipperary South because they have elected a most dedicated Deputy who will serve them well for many years. He has given great service as a Senator and he will also give excellent service as a Deputy. He fills the seat made vacant by the death of the late Deputy Theresa Ahearn. She was a much beloved member of our party. She was unique because she was the only woman in our parliamentary party who represented a rural constituency and she brought that perspective to bear in all debates in the Dáil and in our party. We regret her passing but I know her family, friends, neighbours and supporters could not have wished for a better outcome to the by-election than that her place would be taken by Senator Tom Hayes, who is now the new Deputy for Tipperary South.</P>
    <P>The issues in the by-election were a local manifestation of many of the national issues. There will be time enough to return to them in the future. Anyone who canvassed in the by-election campaign knows what the issues were. While one might argue that they were local they were, in all cases, the local manifestation of issues which are replicated from one end of the country to the other. However, this is not a day to debate that agenda.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Tom Hayes and I congratulate him. I am delighted with his success and I wish him many successful years here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader of the Opposition in welcoming Deputy Tom Hayes to the House. I extend the congratulations of the Government and of the Fianna Fáil Party to him on his election. I have no doubt Deputy Hayes will serve the people of Tipperary South well and will be as able and as diligent a Deputy as his predecessor, Deputy Theresa Ahearn. We remember Theresa and her family particularly today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes's achievement of last Sunday was a memorable one and must have given him great satisfaction. Last year he was narrowly beaten but he has worked hard since then to achieve success. I join Deputy Noonan in congatulating the family of Deputy Hayes, his wife Marian and his sons Pádraic, Ronan and Cathal, and his supporters in his native Golden. They saw him come close to victory in the previous by-election and today is a wonderful day for them. We would like to see a by-election victory on this side of the House but this is Tom Hayes's day and we do not wish to detract from that.</P>
      <P>I commend my own candidate, Councillor Michael Maguire for the time and effort he put into the campaign and for the work he has done for the people of Tipperary South for a long number of years. I am sure he will continue in that work. I acknowledge the contribution of my party's director of elections, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who worked extremely hard in the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware too of the efforts made by the other candidates, Councillors Phil Prendergast and <Col N="43" /> Denis Landy. The campaign was a good and fair one and I applaud all the candidates for their commitment and for the personal sacrifices they are making for the common good in their constituency. I am sure they will continue with the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes and I wish him well. He knows the Oireachtas inside out and I have no doubt he will settle in very quickly in the Dáil. I hope he enjoys his time in this House. I assure him it will quite some time before he has to fight another election.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Noonan. This was his first election as Leader of Fine Gael and he has had a very convincing win.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in congratulating Deputy Noonan, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party, on securing his first by-election victory. He has two more to go to match my own record. For all our sakes, I hope we do not have another by-election in this Dáil.</P>
      <P>I extend warm congratulations to Deputy Tom Hayes. It was a well fought campaign and well prepared over the past 12 months. His success is richly deserved. There is truth in the saying that one must have tasted the bitterness of defeat to relish the sweetness of victory. Deputy Tom Hayes has done that. The party of which he is proud to be a member and all the people who are here should savour this day because their success is richly earned.</P>
      <P>A unique historical event took place in Tipperary South. In the duration of one Dáil, the constituency has experienced the tragedy of two premature deaths. The death of my own colleague, Michael Ferris, was followed by that of Theresa Ahearn. I remember both of them today. As Leader of the Labour Party I remember the work done by Ellen Ferris in the last by-election and the sterling work done by Councillor Denis Landy in this one. I thank the Labour Party director of elections, Deputy Brian O'Shea, and all those who worked with him. Denis Landy was an outstanding candidate and will make a great Labour Deputy for the constituency of Tipperary South.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to all the people who participated in the two by-elections, including the candidates for the Workers Unemployment Action Group and all their activists who participated so wholeheartedly in the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I thank the people of Tipperary South for their courtesy and patience. They are probably the most canvassed citizens in the history of this country. If there were something akin to jury service which you, a Cheann Comhairle, could issue they should be excused from ever having to serve in a by-election again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Quinn in congratulating Deputy Noonan on his success in the by-election <Col N="44" /> and especially in congratulating Deputy Tom Hayes. Since Deputy Hayes came to the Oireachtas he has been a very popular figure and a great champion of the people of what is now his constituency of Tipperary South. I have had the pleasure of getting to know him in the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if one's first day in the Dáil is the best day but it is certainly the most memorable. Unlike many Deputies who are elected in a general election and who have two or three friends in the Public Gallery on their first day, Tom has been able to bring a large group of his supporters. For them and for his wife Marian and his three sons, this is a very special day. They see someone for whom they have worked, who has become a friend and who lost on the last occasion get an opportunity to win at last.</P>
      <P>I remember the late Theresa Ahearn and the late Michael Ferris, who both died prematurely. It is very unusual to have two by-elections in one Dáil in a small three seat constituency. I hope we do not have another. Everyone here is looking quite healthy and after the long summer recess we will be fit and ready for the upcoming session which will last until May or June of next year.</P>

Guím beannacht chomh maith ar na hiarrthóirí eile a bhí an-chróga ins an gcomórtas.</P>
      <P>It is often said that Oppositions do not win elections, Governments lose them but this result is a tribute to Deputy Tom Hayes's qualities of tenacity, loyalty, ability, devotion and hard work. We recognise that this is his day.</P>
      <P>One quality of a successful Deputy which is often talked about but which I have never seen achieved is bi-location. Today, when his supporters &ndash; and particularly his look-alike, Pat Hayes &ndash; appeared in Leinster House it seemed as if Deputy Hayes had that ability. It took me a little while to realise that it was not Deputy Tom Hayes I saw at every corner. Tribute today must also go to the late Deputy Theresa Ahearn whom we were privileged to know as a friend. It is her memory that we bring to the fore today as well as the victory of Deputy Tom Hayes. It is a very fitting tribute to her memory that Fine Gael are able to celebrate a by-election victory in the House today. The issues that were raised in Tipperary South have set the agenda for the campaign for the general election and that campaign is surely under way right now.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes on his victory and I welcome him to the House. He comes from a long tradition of people who have <Col N="45" /> come to this House since the division of our constituency in 1948. I mention General Dick Mulcahy, the late Deputies Crowe and Hogan, Deputy Griffin, who is thankfully still alive, and the late Deputy Theresa Ahearn. I worked with three of those Deputies in the past and I know that I will work with Deputy Hayes as we have done on South Tipperary County Council.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Noonan on the occasion of this his first victory. I was glad he got a punishment in the Munster final and that we had some easing of our pain in that result. I compliment Councillor Michael Maguire on the tremendous hard work he put in. He is a hard-working, honest person and he fought a tremendous campaign in the by-election. I was very proud of his efforts. I also compliment Councillors Prendergast and Landy on their tremendous campaigns. It was by and large a clean by-election campaign and it did not follow the modern political tendency to be dirty. I compliment all participants in the campaign. To those Fine Gael Deputies who visited the constituency I say, do what you promised and look after the boreens from now on, because I will not take all the blame.</P>

      <P>The second proposal is that No. 24, motion re. Approval of Instruments drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union; No. 25, motion re. Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam (proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a general framework for Community activities to facilitate the implementation of a European judicial area in civil matters) and No. 27, motion re. Referral to Joint Committee of Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 (Employment in Licensed Premises) Regulations, 2001 and Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 (Bar Apprentices) Regulations 2001 be dealt with without debate?

      <Col N="51" /> The third proposal is that the Second and remaining Stages of No. 7, Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill, 2001, shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10.00 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Bill, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.

      <P>It is now clear that the Taoiseach does not command the support or the authority to govern effectively. In the recent past he has lost the support of several of his Ministers, he has lost credibility among his European colleagues, he has lost the Cabinet vote on the ESB's investment in Poland, he has lost the referendum on the Nice treaty and he has lost the Tipperary South by-election, where his Fianna Fáil candidate was eliminated once more. In view of this catalogue of failure, will the Taoiseach confirm that we will be back in the House in October?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain to the satisfaction of the House why the principle of collective responsibility in matters of policy appears to be regularly flouted by the Government? Is it an indication that his authority in the Cabinet is being eroded on a progressive and constant basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government works on the basis of discussing items, making decisions, sticking by them and following the constitutional rules of collective responsibility. It has done so for the past four years and will continue to do so for the next year. I assure Deputy Noonan that not only have we not lost any support in Europe, but we have excellent respect for the way we have handled a difficult situation over the past number of weeks.</P>

Will we be back in October and what is the Taoiseach going to do during the summer to give leadership and restore credibility of the Cabinet and the Government so it can govern effectively? There are manifest problems facing the people and the Government is all over the place. When is the Taoiseach going to give leadership?

      <P>The Taoiseach reminds me of the farmyard cock who crows with delight when the sun comes over the horizon, claiming credit for that wonderful achievement. Is the Taoiseach aware that, according to replies to questions put by two of my colleagues to the Minister for Education and Science, answered on 26 June, children going into school this autumn will be dealing with textbooks which will not refer to the euro or prepare them for the changeover which takes place at the beginning of 2002 and that they will be learning accountancy and other principles in relation to the currency of the State which will disappear on 11 February 2002? Is he aware that in the pathetic reply given by the Minister he said he had no responsibility for the production of the relevant textbooks and school books? Is he further aware that according to a recent survey among small and medium sized businesses and among the population on the forthcoming arrival of the euro, the level of awareness in the Republic is among the lowest of the 12 member states which will participate in the currency? Does he regard it as satisfactory that the Minister for Education and Science has failed to ensure the school system will be properly resourced and that textbooks are available to assist teachers in dealing with this problem in the classroom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply will the Taoiseach not attack the Opposition but give us a full briefing on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the individual replies, and I do not think Deputy Quinn would have expected me to. The importance of the euro <Col N="53" /> changeover and the work of the Euro Changeover Board was again discussed today by the Cabinet. There will be a special session of the Cabinet in the next few weeks on this issue, based on the necessity for us to drive the awareness campaign and to make sure businesses, including small businesses, consumers and every other sector are making the necessary preparations. I will raise the issue as it is a valid point. There are 1.2 million in the education system. For the past 18 months we have had a monthly report across all Departments and Government agencies and we have been trying to overcome a number of difficulties. Mr. Hamill of the Euro Changeover Board and his colleagues inform us that, while there are difficulties, they are well on target. We will have a meeting in July to discuss these issues, and I will raise the issue referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that an excellent exercise undertaken last year by my colleague, Deputy Shortall, showed that the commencement costs of a young pupil moving from primary to secondary education, which fall on the shoulders of a parent, is £707 or 898 euros, and that this cost is a burden which falls very unequally on parents because of their inability to pay or the necessity to borrow money from credit unions? In dealing with this transition, has the Taoiseach any plans to make available additional money by way of book and school grants for people moving from primary to secondary education?</P>
      <P>In relation to my earlier question on preparations for the euro, will the Taoiseach specifically raise with the Euro Changeover Board, and in particular with Mr. Hamill, the possibility of a specific textbook being provided by that body as part of the overall costs of the changeover so no child going into primary or secondary school this autumn will be without the kind of textbook they need so they are equipped to fully understand the currency with which they will have to live for the rest of their lives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Euro Changeover Board has had a campaign targeted at schools, but not a textbook. I will raise that point.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise the point made by the Deputy when we have the meeting with the board.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, while resources are given to various schemes, this year there will be a significant increase in child benefit. The other schemes have also been improved over the past number of years. While they may not fully cover all the costs they are a substantial improvement on the situation as it was and are a big help to those who have children starting school and changing from one year to another.</P>

Has this matter been put out to consultants? I am sure their report will be worthy, but the whole idea was that Members would make decisions on that question.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with three aspects of the payments made to leaders of parliamentary parties &ndash; how they are computed, how they are audited and how they are adjusted following a merger of parliamentary parties. I propose to deal with each of them but not in the order in which they occur in the Bill.</P>
      <P>These allowances have been with us in one shape or another since 1938. When my first Fianna Fáil predecessor, Sean McEntee, introduced the concept of an allowance for the leader of the main Opposition party, it was not a popular move &ndash; particularly with his own supporters. He recognised that there was a price to be paid for parliamentary democracy and that one component of that price, at a time when public funds were small and imperative demands on them great, was some subvention of parliamentary Opposition. Subsequent Governments accepted and developed that approach and now allowances are paid to leaders of all parties represented in this House and to non-party members.</P>
      <P>Sean McEntee made it clear that this allowance was not a salary for the leader and indicated to this House on what he saw this money being spent. Quite deliberately, he opted not to set his catalogue of leaders expenditure in the concrete of a statutory definition but to leave scope for its adjustment to the needs of different Opposition leaders, the culture of different parties and changing priorities over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until today, there have been two qualifications of the McEntee doctrine since 1938. First, the allowance was specified as being for parliamentary purposes, including research, and following the McKenna judgment prohibited for use for electoral purposes. These remain the parameters for the use of the allowance and when this legislation was first mooted the representatives of all parties I consulted initially felt it should be left as it was. Effectively, what they told me was that we all know what &ldquo;parliamentary purposes&rdquo; mean and, if there had been any confusion about it years ago, it has long since been clarified through <Col N="61" /> public discussion. Equally, breaching the ban on electoral use of the allowances carries such a practical risk of a result being challenged by a disappointed candidate that only a party leader with pronounced kamikaze tendencies would even contemplate it. These I accept are not unreasonable ways of looking at things.</P>
    <P>However, it is equally valid to say that the propriety of this particular public expenditure is currently self-policed and that it is appropriate that normal audit procedures should be put in place to correct this. The Bill provides that each leader will be required to prepare a statement of his or her expenditure, have it audited by a public auditor &ndash; not an employee of any State institution &ndash; and to submit it with that auditor's report to the Public Officers Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 1(11) sets out where the responsibility to carry out these obligations rests where a leader dies or resigns before he or she has complied with them. Its sanction for non-compliance is simple &ndash; fail to deliver and the cash flow dries up until one does. The documentation comes to the commission for its consideration. It may seek from a leader some clarification and then report to the Minister for Finance telling him or her whether the leader's statement and auditor's report came within the time specified, are adequate or inappropriate or disclose any expenditure which does not comply with the requirements of the relevant subsection. The commission's report is laid before the Oireachtas and the commission must retain in its office for three years the leader's statement and auditor's report freely accessible to the public. These arrangements are broadly in line with the arrangements applying to party funds provided under the Electoral Act.</P>
    <P>A second criticism heard from time to time was that parliamentary activities could mean everything or nothing. I want a system which will stand the test of time, and none of us who joined this House in 1977 or others who came earlier would have won a prize for predicting the items of expenditure which would feature regularly in a parliamentary party's statement of expenditure. What I have done after serious consultations with all party leaders is set out a list of what we regard as proper categories on which a leader's allowance could be spent. However, if one looks at the subsection which lists these items, it states that the parliamentary activity includes them. This clearly signals that the list is intended to be a snapshot of what the party leaders collectively have seen in recent years and now see as activities and items that have to be financed from that allowance, and all of us in this House appreciate that equally legitimate categories of which we have not thought may arise in the future. They can be added to the list eventually if they come to be a regular feature.</P>
    <P>The second new element in this Bill is to take account of mergers between parliamentary parties when fixing allowances. Where it was relevant since 1938, no account was taken in fixing leaders allowances of accretions his or her party <Col N="62" /> acquired in this House during the life of a Dáil by defection from another party or the conversion of an Independent. This seemed reasonable. The electorate had provided votes which elected a Member on the basis of the badge he wore at a general or by-election and they were entitled to expect their party to enjoy that Deputy's support in the voting lobbies and financially. Deputy Quinn, when radically altering the basis of payment in 1996, held firmly to this position. The money stayed where the Deputy started and did not go where he or she moved &ndash; whether it was to another party or to non-party status. Most of us thought that was reasonable.</P>
    <P>Mergers or take-overs of smaller parties have not been unknown since the Oireachtas was established. In the 1920s and 1930s what is now Fine Gael merged with several parties and the Labour Party did likewise in the 1940s and later. None of these exercises had any implications for the leaders allowance either because it did not exist or because the legal provisions then in place did not affect it.</P>
    <P>The merger during the life of this Dáil of Labour and Democratic Left was different. Both had leaders who were paid on the basis of the Dáil strength of their parties. Democratic Left's stopped and Labour's was unaffected. This was because Deputy Quinn's Act of 1996 provided that the leaders allowance was based on the number of Deputies elected as &ldquo;members of that party at the previous General Election or at a subsequent by-election&rdquo;. The Deputies involved felt hard done by. This was not a political smash and grab where a party captured a discontented Member of a rival party or led a lonely Independent astray. This was a different class of a thing altogether. Two parties with a long standing ideological affinity decided that they were after all compatible and both parliamentary parties and their parties at large decided democratically that they would together become the Labour Party. I am accepting the Labour Party approach and agreeing that the same facility should be available to any parties where all the Dáil and Seanad Members agree to merge in the future. I propose, however, to retain otherwise the arrangements where a defection would not cost funds to the parliamentary party to which the Member had belonged at election time, and would not travel into another party or direct to him or her in the case of opting for non-party status.</P>
    <P>At the start of the Bill, the rates of allowances which I and the Government feel should be paid to parliamentary parties of varying strength are set out. In this we are following, with some adjustment, the approach taken by my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, when he decided to radicalise the leaders allowance system by removing the requirement that a party had to have seven Deputies elected before they got a share of cash allocated to parliamentary parties and by extending the allowances to the Independents. The adjustments we are making take account for the first time that Senators are members of var<Col N="63" /> ious parliamentary parties and make demands, as Deputies do, on the services and facilities which a parliamentary party has to provide to all its members. These demands have been greater in recent years as the Seanad made greater use of specialised committees and as Senators took part with their colleagues from this House in joint committees &ndash; some of which have proved to impose heavy and contentious burdens. The sums this Bill would provide on their account are, like those for Dáil Members, tapered but only involve two rates for parties and one for Independents because the Seanad is smaller. Those sums are lower than for the general run of Deputies because of the wider function which Deputies have.</P>
    <P>The second change we wish to make is in the tapering system as it applies to the Dáil. At present there are four categories &ndash; first five; six to ten; 11 to 60 and over 60. This is being reduced to three &ndash; first ten; 11 to 30 and over 31. Deputy Quinn took the view, not unreasonably, that the rates should be skewed in favour of the smaller parties on the grounds that a party with five or less members had to keep the party flag flying on several issues with a consequent higher necessary &ldquo;spend&rdquo; per member than a larger party or a non-party member. While I would not want to send that view up in flames, there has been a feeling around this House, at least from an early stage in the life of this Dáil, that larger parties have fared less than equitably under the scheme and that the same would be true in the future for parties with between five and ten Dáil Members. The new dispensation would involve treating the first ten Dáil Members in the same way as the first five are currently treated and the next 20 in the way six to ten are treated under the existing scheme. The rest, including parties with more than 60 members, will get the rate currently paid to parties with between 11 and 60 members.</P>
    <P>For non-party Deputies, we propose to apply a straight formula &ndash; they will each receive the average of the payment made in respect of each party member. This represents a significant increase for them but still leaves them significantly behind the one man Dáil party leader. Some of the more dyed in the wool party members think this practice should not be continued but the fact is that any Minister or Government who wants to avoid becoming embroiled in constitutional litigation must be wary of any measure which could be interpreted as treating non-party members in a discriminatory way.</P>
    <P>There is one point not strictly related to the Bill which I consider appropriate here because it relates to a select group of former leaders. Over recent Saturdays, RTE radio has broadcast programmes in which political events of particular epochs were recalled and picked over by academics whose focus was ex-Taoisigh. I have not yet formed a definitive view on the series because it has not dealt with the period or per<Col N="64" /> sonalities in regard to which I claim a certain expertise and sufficient familiarity to know when the pundits have been sold a pup. For me, the fundamental point which came across from the programme was that our democracy has been led by a handful &ndash; far fewer than our neighbours or partners &ndash; of capable and hard-working men, to whom we owe an immense debt, for in excess of 80 years.</P>
    <P>When a Taoiseach leaves office and subsequently leaves this House, elements of the burden of office remain. Constitutionally, he becomes a member of the Council of State and takes part in its formal duty of advising the President on contentious matters. In the nature of things, a Taoiseach becomes public property, a status less easy to shed than the office itself or the role of party leader. The public, or significant elements of it, are reluctant to give up their ownership of the person in question. Ex-Taoisigh are routinely invited to make appearances at events and openings, are expected to deal with representations from contemporaries as if they still held public office and may be required to offer delicate advice to their successors. They will invariably become targets for shoals of researchers in the fields of history, administration or political science or producers of television reminiscence slots. Some persistent editor is almost certain to ask them to contribute to Christmas or summer book reviews or write a short piece for an educational or exam supplement. Somebody else may ask them to join other notables in producing a self-made painting for a charity auction.</P>
    <P>While there is no obligation on ex-Taoisigh to do any of these things, the badgering and entreaties will possibly not cease until they die. Dealing with correspondence or dealing with telephone calls makes increasing demands with advancing age. I take the view that this burden should be eased and I propose to deal with it outside this Bill by providing, under the Taoiseach's Vote, for each former Taoiseach to have a secretarial assistant remunerated at the same level as secretarial assistants in this House. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not untimely and is very much in line with proposals I authored in the Fine Gael policy document, A Democratic Revolution, which the Minister has read. This Bill, the Bill which the House will debate tomorrow and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill must be considered in their totality. The flip slide to the proposals in A Democratic Revolution which relate to providing parliamentarians with long overdue and badly needed improved allowances and staff levels is that we must deal with our existing responsibilities in a more thorough, effective and efficient manner or take on new responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope when this House resumes in October, the Oireachtas commission legislation will contain radical proposals for a complete overhaul of <Col N="65" /> the operations of this House and its committees. There are currently five Members in the Chamber. We know that if the bells ring for a vote, our colleagues will come into the Chamber. None of them is lying out in the sun; they are in their offices working or are attending committee meetings. I do not know of any other parliament which conducts its business in this way. Most other parliaments do not hold plenary sessions and committee meetings in parallel. We expect powers of bi-location, tri-location or more from Oireachtas Members. It is not unusual for two committees of which one is a member to meet at the same time as the Dáil or a parliamentary party meeting. The result is the scandal visible on television every night &ndash; empty benches.</P>
    <P>In the past three of four weeks, a broad range of legislation, resolutions, motions etc. has been passed through this House without even the most scant scrutiny. This unacceptable practice must not be allowed to continue. I have been long enough in the Dáil, as has the Minister, to remember when a motion beginning &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders . . .&rdquo;&ndash; the guillotine as we now know it &ndash; was a rarity which was met with an enormous row. This practice is now a regular feature of the Order of Business, having usually been agreed between the Whips. It is vital that we break the cosy arrangements which exist between the Whips. Those arrangements make life easy for the Whips, Ministers and Members in general but we are not elected to this House for an easy life. We are here to scrutinise and enact legislation and to hold Ministers to account. We are here to ensure that citizens' business is conducted in the most effective and thorough manner possible. My welcome for this Bill and the legislation with which we will deal tomorrow is not unqualified. It is predicated on whether the manner in which we conduct our business, for which we will now be reasonably well paid, is radically and speedily altered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to provide secretarial assistants to ex-Taoisigh. What about the widows of former Taoisigh who have worked for this country in a totally unpaid capacity over the years and whose former status confers on them ongoing public duties? What about former Presidents and their spouses who have also given enormous service to this country? We should not be mean about this. We should treat our former Presidents and their spouses and our former Taoisigh and their spouses with the generosity that people would expect. They should be given the necessary facilities to enable them to do what their former positions continue to impose on them, even in retirement.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of fairness and proportionality, which is very much in the eye of the beholder. The Minister talked about the arrangements for the Leader and sole member of a party, such as Deputy Joe Higgins's position. He is one of the hardest working Members of this House.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill, Independents are being given an increase in the personal parliamentary allowance from £15,000 to £22,000, but uniquely they will not have to account for it. They are not required as party Leaders, and I assume in this case Deputy Joe Higgins is a party Leader, to account for that allowance. They can spend it as they like. A report on the spending of it will not be required to be made to the Public Offices Commission and subsequently to the Dáil. That is fundamentally wrong.</P>
      <P>I share a constituency with an Independent, Deputy Gregory, for whom I have the greatest respect. Why should he have £22,000 to spend that I do not have? My party gets an allowance in respect of me, but I do not see it. It is used for official parliamentary work. Why should Independents get a £22,000 allowance &ndash; which other Deputies do not see sight of &ndash; and not have to account for it?</P>
      <P>This is a serious question. I am influenced on this view given my former position as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. There must be accountability for all public funds. When account is taken of Deputy Healy-Rae's chairmanship of a committee, his £22,000 allowance tax free, his travel allowance and his membership of the county council, his income is more than that of a Minister. He could not afford to be a Cabinet Minister. It would be a demotion for him. He does not have to account to anybody for the spending of that income. He does not answer questions in Dáil as Ministers must. He does not have to produce accounts for the expenditure of his allowance, which will be increased to £22,000. He does not have to report to the Public Offices Commission. He is not subject to any query, scrutiny, comment or criticism from anybody. He could spend that allowance on personal items. The allowance given to the parties cannot be spent in that way. It must be spent for strictly parliamentary purposes and it is in the control of the party Leader, not the Deputies. That puts Deputies who share a constituency with Independents at an enormous disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government may be particularly dependent on Independents. It is smart to line their pockets to keep them sweet, but it is wrong that they will get an allowance of £22,000 which they can spend as they like without needing to account for it or it being audited. I hope the Minister will agree that is wrong and agree to a proposal on <Col N="67" /> Committee Stage that the same audit and accounting procedures will be required of Independents as are required of party leaders.</P>
    <P>The package proposed under this Bill and the Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2001, need to be taken in the context of the Electoral Bill, which has nearly completed its passage through this House and will be enacted within the next week or two. There are also extremely generous and possibly dangerous provisions regarding smaller parties in that Bill. It puts down the qualification that any party which gets 2% of the national vote will automatically get £100,000 per annum. That has been put in to suit the Progressive Democrats, but it is very short sighted. That will encourage all the small parties to run candidates everywhere to try to reach the 2% figure. If a small party was to run a candidate in every constituency, very few small parties would get less than 2% of the vote and a few of them would get 4% or 5% or a quota, as in the case of Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>We are encouraging splintering of the democratic process and that entails a potential danger. Who will form the Government if the process is splintered? I have no doubt this is proposed merely to address the current situation of the Progressive Democrats whose support might fall as low as 2% of the national vote. It would be much better if that provision in the Electoral Bill was based on a requirement that at least one seat must be won by a party. Under this proposal, if there was a raving lunatic party here as there is in the United Kingdom&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it would be entitled to £100,000 because it would get more than 2% of the national vote. That proposal is a bad idea, although genuine political movements which are not part of the political establishment but have serious policy issues and significant support among the electorate ought to be recognised. The 2% threshold is too low. A small party should be required to have at least one candidate elected to this House or, alternatively, to get 4% of the national vote to get that sum.</P>
      <P>The totality of the package would mean that the support per Member for the smaller parties would be much greater than the support per Member of the larger parties. That would be the extraordinary position. The totality of the proposals put forward in recent days would also disportionately benefit the Government parties, because under them the Seanad would be taken into account, including the 11 nominated Members. The relationship between funding of the Opposition and the Government would be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, the allowance was introduced by Sean McEntee when Minister for Fin<Col N="68" /> ance to recognise that the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Front Bench have a particularly onerous role in respect of parliamentary activities. That was extended rightly to include all parties in Opposition. It was acknowledged that because the Government of the day had the apparatus of the State, the Civil Service, at its disposal, it should get only two-thirds of the normal allowance. If these proposals go through, as they surely will, that ratio would change because they take into account the Seanad and the Fianna Fáil allowance would increase by a great deal more than the Fine Gael or Labour allowances. The balance between Government and Opposition would be changed to the disadvantage of the Opposition. That should not be the case. That is in defiance of one of the original principles &ndash; that as the Government has the apparatus of the State at its disposal, it does not need the same back-up that is required by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Oireachtas Commission Bill comes before the House it will recognise the role of the Opposition, particularly the onerous tasks of shadow Ministers. All Members are entitled to one secretarial assistant, regardless of their duties in the House. If one is shadowing a Department, as Opposition frontbenchers do, one has a much more onerous job than Members who are not.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell and I, in the period since I became spokesman on finance, have been dealing with almost ten Finance Bills, the Finance Estimates, the Taoiseach's Estimates, parliamentary questions and other motions. Often, it amounts to two or three items per week, as it does this week. We have nobody to do our research and prepare briefs on such matters, which is wrong.</P>
    <P>Likewise, where the shadowing of the Department of the Environment and Local Government is concerned, there has been a huge number of Bills and motions before the House in the past ten weeks. Deputy Olivia Mitchell, our spokesperson on the environment, is excessively busy. It is not an acceptable way to shadow legislation as it often necessitates one taking an <i>ad hoc </i>approach lacking in detailed scrutiny.</P>
    <P>When the commission is set up &ndash; which I welcome being the one who proposed it in the DIRT inquiry &ndash; I hope an additional assistant will be provided for every Member. Given the raft of legislation we have and will have to deal with, especially when adding the Electoral Bill, the Standards in Public Office Bill and the Prevention of Corruption Bill to the previous legislation &ndash; the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Acts &ndash; every Member will have to keep detailed records.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member for more than 24 years. I have no detailed records because I have never had anybody to keep files for me. The keeping of files would be considered a minimum provision in a small office outside the House. I have no files but piles of papers. I am sure every Member is in the same position. We have no means of filing, but will have to acquire one or we will look cor<Col N="69" /> rupt if we cannot answer queries. Will the Minister confirm that there will be extra assistants for each Member? In addition to these, I want extra assistance for the Members of the front benches of the Opposition parties, in recognition of the huge workload.</P>
    <P>We need this assistance if we are to have an effective parliament. The House must be overhauled rapidly, ideally before this Dáil is dissolved so the proposals can be carried out before the next one. I know the commission's proposals will mean additional duties for the Ceann Comhairle and the staff of the Houses. Where proper administration is concerned, we are moving in the right direction. However, we cannot accept the goodies and not do the work. We must embrace the rest of the proposals. The Government has its proposals and Fine Gael has its own proposals for a democratic revolution.</P>
    <P>It is generous of the Minister to recognise the merger between the Labour Party and the Democratic Left. What he has provided for is justified, if belated. I think and hope it is properly backdated.</P>

      <P>I welcome that.</P>
      <P>In respect of the proposal in section 1 to substitute a new section into the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, section 1(3)(<i>a</i>) states:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) a member of Dáil Eireann, who at the last preceding general election or at a subsequent bye-election was elected as a member of Dáil Eireann other than as a member of a qualifying party, an annual allowance in connection with his or her parliamentary activities of 27,934 (£22,000).</P>
      <P>I am not objecting to the figure of £22,000, but I am objecting to the fact there are no audit or reporting requirements. Will the Minister provide the reporting and accounting requirements that befit leaders' allowances? This also applies to section 1(3)(<i>b</i>) concerning Seanad Eireann.</P>
      <P>Section 1(4) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and to such exceptions, restrictions and conditions as may be provided for by regulations, secretarial facilities may be provided to a qualifying party for the purposes of facilitating the parliamentary activities of its elected members.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister uses this power to provide the extra staff that is long overdue. It is absolutely necessary because of the raft of legislation.</P>
      <P>Salary allowances are inadequate to hire secretaries and many Members are having great difficulties as a result. Just as other employers recognise this, it must be recognised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify section 1(6), which states that &ldquo;An allowance paid by virtue of this section shall not be liable to income tax.&rdquo;? Is that <Col N="70" /> an allowance to the Leader or does it apply to provisions further on in the Bill?</P>
    <P>Section 1(14)(<i>h</i>) states that:</P>
    <P>the payment to a parliamentary leader of any salary or honorarium in respect of duties arising from his or her activities as such leader as distinct from those of 45 a member of Dáil Eireann or a holder of a ministerial office,</P>
    <P>Section 1(14)(<i>i</i>) states that:</P>
    <P>the payment to another person of any salary or honorarium in respect of duties arising from the person's activities in a parliamentary party,</P>
    <P>Are those payments subject to tax, or are they non-taxable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question on section 1(6), the first part of the payment of the allowance to the Leader shall not be subject to income tax.</P>
      <P>With regard to sections 1(14)(<i>h</i>) and 1(14)(<i>i</i>), the payment of an allowance to a party leader is exempt from income tax under subsection (6), as I have said, but any subsequent payments by way of salary or honoraria are subject to income tax in the normal way. The total sum covers the payment from the State to the leader, but if the party is hiring someone, that person is subject to normal income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's clarification. Party leaders are extremely busy people. Given recent public concern and certain circumstances that have materialised, there is a need for a compliance or accounting officer of some sort. This officer would control and account for payments under a leader. No provision has been made for this.</P>
      <P>The new section 10(11)(<i>f</i>) states: &ldquo;This subsection does not apply to an allowance paid to a parliamentary leader under this section before 1 January 2001&rdquo;. I assume that means the provisions of the Bill will be backdated to all allowances paid from 1 January of this year. I welcome that the Minister may extend the additional categories of expenditure which may be covered by the Bill, because circumstances can change. However, he can only do that after consultation with party leaders.</P>
      <P>The new section 10(14) restates many of the old provisions on how the leader's allowance may be paid and adds one or two new categories. Perhaps the Minister will respond by spelling out in detail what those new categories are and what is their purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>All the categories under the new section 10(14) are new. There were no restrictions before this and it was decided to include a list of categories and to say that expenses arising from parliamentary duty, including research, included expenditure on the categories listed. That does not mean expenditure on other areas is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> This is how we solved this problem. Seán MacEntee said in 1938 that it was up to the Opposition leader to decide how he or she wanted to spend the allowance and that no one else should know about it. I go along with that principle rather than constraining a party leader. Hence the subsection states that expenditure will include the stated categories but does not exclude anything else. They are all new. There was nothing before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure must also be reported, which is welcome. Regard must also be had to the rights of individual Members which are often forgotten in the House. When Mr. MacEntee proposed the leader's allowance at the time, James Dillon was also of the view that, once a Member claimed allowances or whatever, that was the end of the matter. He should be paid the allowances and no questions asked. Unfortunately, we live in a different era and it is a matter of great regret that we are in a position where the word of honour of a Member is not accepted. It is also unfortunate and a matter of great regret that there is some justification for that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes. We have a duty to follow it through by reforming the House dramatically. There are ample proposals printed for a long time: our proposals in A Democratic Revolution and the Government's proposals for parliamentary reform. The proposals we deal with today and tomorrow will be welcomed by the public only if they are followed quickly by the type of radical reform we have espoused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcomes the Bill but not without qualifications. It is important we appreciate that it effectively does two things. It increases considerably the parliamentary allowances paid to leaders of political parties in the House and also sets in place auditing procedures. The increases, taken together with the increases to political parties made under the Electoral Bill are considerable and go a long way towards instituting genuine State funding of politics in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It behoves us as we acknowledge that to make the case for State funding because it needs to be made. Reading some newspapers and listening to what people say, one would conclude that the public is far from convinced that the case is well made. Many members of the public believe political parties are commercial entities that make money or have inherited money down through the ages. My mother is capable of that and has on occasion asked me: &ldquo;Does the party not pay for that&rdquo;. I keep telling her that I am the party. There is no stash of funds, either locally or nationally, that pays for various expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make the case for significant State funding of political parties. It must be pointed out to people that political parties are voluntary organisations which comprise volunteers and a few paid staff. All political parties in the House <Col N="72" /> ask Members to spend increasing amounts of their time organising basic fund-raisers, whether they be national collections, race nights, quiz nights or whatever, to the extent that it is becoming difficult for many political parties in the House to encourage people to join them. The one exception is Sinn Féin which appears to have lines of funding the rest of us do not have, some legal, others not and most outside the country. I do not imagine most of the rest of us would care to go that road.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves and those who put the question to us to ask themselves what happens if there is not State funding. Either of two things happens. Either funding is raised privately through the various fund-raisers I have mentioned, but more particularly through big business and large donations, or alternatively politics is under-funded or not at all. We have had experience of all those phenomena.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell rightly pointed out, the activities of the House and Members of the House have been hugely under-resourced through the decades. While I compliment the Minister's Department on undergoing what appears to be a frenetic period of creativity, it has meant that Deputy Mitchell and I have had to deal with a range of legislation and Estimates over the past three or four months without resources. It would be possible for more than one person to do the job of Opposition spokesperson and nothing else and completely ignore their constituencies, which is something none of us can afford to do. Either one stays awake at night worrying about it or one does one's best given the limited resources. It is not possible to do the job to the level we would like or to do the various jobs we are required to do to the level we are required to do them.</P>
    <P>I welcome that, for the first time, we are giving realistic funding to political parties to enable them do the job we want them to do. However, we have always seen State funding of politics as a trade-off against the elimination of corporate funding of politics. If we are to persuade the public it is a good thing for taxpayers' money to be used to resource politics, we must be able to say to them with some persuasion that the scandal of big business buying influence has ended. I am not sure we can do that yet.</P>
    <P>The Government has moved in the Electoral Bill to cap the amount of corporate donations in any given year to £5,000. Only time will tell what effect that will have on the parties in the House which receive significant funding from private business. It is not difficult to imagine that it would be possible for business and for parties to work out ways around it to ensure the funding they receive from the corporate sector continues at what I regard as unacceptably high levels.</P>
    <P>The view of my party is that any level is unacceptable. It may be that businessmen in their magnanimity or out of civic mindedness have over the years given and possibly still give money to political parties without expecting anything in <Col N="73" /> return. However, it is beyond doubt that the public can no longer be persuaded of that. They are satisfied that money is being used in a way which corrupts politics and which buys favours and politicians. The reality is that there has been ample evidence in the relatively recent past that this happened and at a level that is utterly unacceptable. We are faced with a crisis of confidence in politics and politicians. Our standing as people who do a particular job has never been lower in the history of the State and there is no sign of this improving. One of the measures which in my view is indispensable if we are to get round that corner is to banish the influence of business, particularly big business, from politics, which requires the elimination of corporate funding. It may seem this is an argument from last week or for a different forum but I believe it is necessarily connected with the measures we are taking here today in increasing State funding, because the two should be alternatives. If we are to get increased money from taxpayers, we should not take money from the corporate sector, and I am sorry we are continuing to perpetuate the funding.</P>
    <P>I welcome the auditing of the accounts. On Committee Stage, or perhaps later in this contribution, I would like to question the extent to which we are requiring statements from party leaders. However, I welcome the establishment of the principle that there must be a statement from party leaders in respect of what their parties have done with taxpayers' money. If we are to receive £4 million of taxpayers' money in any given year, it is incumbent on the political parties, particularly party leaders, to account for that money. I am concerned that the obligations being placed on leaders are perhaps not as stringent as they should be. There is a requirement for a statement but the Bill does not specify what should be in the statement. The Bill does not specify how much of the party leader's allowance is spent in any one year on each of the items listed in subsection (14). Will it be possible for a party leader to submit a statement giving large rounded numbers and no further details? It might have been better to provide for an independent auditor or that an auditor appointed by the House or the Minister would examine the statements provided by each of the leaders and audit on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be like any business that prepares a statement of its profit and loss account or, in the case of a charitable organisation, its income and expenditure account. The income could come from the State and listed would be items of expenditure in normal classifications. The auditor would examine that and make an auditor's statement on whether spending is in accordance with what is provided for in the Bill. That will be relied on by the Public Offices Commission. Auditors' statements do not relate only to profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. The local tennis club, golf club or GAA club might have an income and expenditure account and not necessarily a balance sheet, which is quite normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying but we have a difficulty in that there is one item which is disallowed, that is, election expenditure. It will be difficult for an auditor looking at the statement to work out whether the money was, in fact, spent on election expenditure. If, for example, the leaders were to include what it cost them to travel up and down to Tipperary South in the past three or four weeks, that would not on the face of it show up on the statement. On the other hand, if such a level of detail is required in the statement that one can definitely exclude that, then one is talking about considerable detail. I am not sure if we want that either. It will be difficult to ensure we exclude the electoral heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke about the need to improve resources in this House and I unequivocally endorse what he said in that regard. Perhaps the most obvious heading is that of research. Several different approaches can be taken in this area, the simplest of which would be to provide each Member with a secretarial assistant who would deal with research issues. Alternatively, the service could be provided to just front bench spokespersons of the Opposition parties. Perhaps we should consider a research facility either in the House or associated with the House which is the practice in other democracies. The United States Congress has an extremely well-resourced library which does a great deal of research on behalf of members of Congress. One can ask a research assistant in the library to have research carried out on, for example, the issue of carbon taxes, and he or she will come back with a qualification at the start which states &ldquo;the research is being carried out on the instructions of the member concerned, that they have been asked to carry out the research and have come up with the following information&rdquo;. Therefore, it <Col N="75" /> cannot be touted as being the opinion of the library.</P>
      <P>There is an argument to be made for a central research facility, whether it is based in the Oireachtas Library or elsewhere. There should be a dedicated research facility because we should avoid the situation where Members are given a research assistant who is intended to advise or assist in dealing with policy areas but who effectively becomes another constituency assistant. I do not think we want to get into that business. I acknowledge that we need to define the provision in a way which ensures the additional assistance is used for research because we need that facility.</P>
      <P>Shortly after being elected to the Dáil I attended my first meeting of the European Socialists, the group with which the Labour Party is associated, dealing with environmental matters. Within a few moments of my arriving at the meeting in Brussels, the Swedish guy was circulating his bibliography, including books and pamphlets which he had written on various environmental issues and which he thought I might find useful. To say I felt inadequate is to understate the case considerably. Incidentally, this guy was an apparatchik rather than a spokesperson and had been working for the Social Democratic Party of Sweden on environmental matters for approximately ten years. During that time he produced a number of policy documents which had been printed off his books, pamphlets and so on and which he thought it perfectly natural to circulate.</P>
      <P>Our parties are simply not in the same league in this regard. I do not think anyone who cares about politics and the formulation of policy can possibly argue that we are misusing taxpayers' money in any way if we wish to contribute to genuine public debate. I sometimes despair at the level of public debate on policy areas in this country. To take my previous example, what sort of debate is there here about carbon taxes, green taxes and the environment? It is very limited. In other countries, political parties are in a position to draw on expertise either within their own parties or from outside. There are policy research institutes which sometimes are associated with political parties, sometimes with a particular point of view or which may be independent. Other than the ESRI or academic based individuals in third level institutions, that level of debate simply does not happen here. There is not the sort of research or debate about policy which is taken for granted in most other countries. The Dáil and all political parties in the House have an essential role to play in encouraging this to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the provision in the Bill which affects my party. When the merger of Democratic Left and the Labour Party took place the merged party lost the best part of £250,000 worth of funding in that the allowance previously paid to the leader of the Democratic Left, Deputy De Rossa, was not payable under the legislation as it then stood and still stands today. The case was made <Col N="76" /> by the now president of my party, Deputy De Rossa, to the Public Offices Commission who accepted there was merit in the case although it properly pointed out that the legislation did not allow for any change. The case has been made by my party to the Minister and I acknowledge that he graciously accepted it. The party is grateful for the additional benefit given to it by the Minister. I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>

      <P>That is fine. It was not an attempt on the part of the Labour Party to engage in a political smash-and-grab or to waylay Deputy Higgins in any way. I am sure he wishes to clarify that his efforts to do the same to the Labour Party are also at an end. I acknowledge that the Minister has been gracious in acceding to a well made case on the part of the Labour Party and Democratic Left.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell's comments about the Independent Deputies. It is right that all Members of the House should be facilitated with regard to research, contributing to debates and parliamentary activities as well as political activity outside the House in terms of promulgating and putting forward their case. However, I do not understand how the same argument applies to Independents. A number of the Independents use the House as an extension of their county council activities. While that is their choice and the choice of the people who elected them, I am not sure they are entitled to an extra £22,000 of salary to do it.</P>
      <P>Even if we accept &ndash; as the Minister appears to think we must in a legal context &ndash; that they cannot be discriminated against under this heading, I do not agree that they should be entitled to pocket the money without accounting for it. I would be obliged if the Minister explained why individual Independents who receive the £22,000 are exempt from the requirement to make a statement, as the leaders of political parties must make, at the end of each year. There is no persuasive argument as to why that should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is toothless in terms of the sanctions that may be exercised in the event of non-compliance with its requirements. This requirement is informed by experience in the relatively recent past involving a former leader of the Minister's party. While I do not wish to prejudge what might be decided at the tribunals, there is enough uncontroverted and uncontradicted evidence already in the public domain to suggest that moneys were used for purposes that could not possibly be considered parliamentary. The truth is that, even after the Bill is enacted, it may become public knowledge, but there is no sanction of any type for what was clearly a use of public money in a way that could not possibly have <Col N="77" /> been envisaged by the Minister who made it available at the time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but not without some equivocation and reservation, particularly on the issue of corporate funding. My party has always supported the concept of public money being used to support diversity in politics, but the<i> quid pro quo</i> should have been the elimination of corporate funding. I regret that has not happened.</P>

      <P>I welcome the audit provided for in the legislation. It is inexplicable that it was not introduced long ago. If it had been introduced, we may not have had some of the regrettable abuses of the party leader's allowance where blank cheques were signed on some occasions and outrageous expenditure was incurred on personal effects and entertainment, etc.</P>
      <P>However, as usual, the Minister for Finance has not surprised me. With a sleight-of-hand under the cover of the Bill, he has introduced some other substantial measures that particularly benefit the major parties in terms of funding. One must read the Bill in conjunction with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which is currently before the House. As a result of these Bills, many parties, but particularly big parties in the House, will be hugely favoured by extra money from the taxpayer. If figures I have received are correct, the Fianna Fáil Party will receive £1.5 million per year for the party leader's allowance while the Fine Gael Party will receive £1.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smaller parties and Independents striving to enter the House will be disadvantaged compared to the moneys that will be given to parties that gain 2% of the vote or the larger parties in the Dáil. For example, as a result of the two Bills, the Socialist Workers Party will be unfavourably treated in the sense that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government proposes to limit the donations I can give to my party on an annual basis to £5,000. I agree with that level with regard to corporate donations, but I ask the Minister or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make an exception where a Deputy wishes to live on the average wage &ndash; this is the policy of the Socialist Workers Party &ndash; and to give other money to his or her party which struggles to make ends meet. However, the sum is capped by the Electoral (Amendment) Bill at £5,000 as if I was in the same position as a tycoon. It is not corruption if I or any other <Col N="78" /> Deputy wishes to live on the average wage and give money to their party. This aspect should be taken into account.</P>

To qualify for the allowance, one must have a registered political party, which means party offices, branches, branch structures and, in the case of a contribution to the Dáil, substantial research, etc. I agree that Independent Deputies who qualify for money must be put in the same category as the party leaders in terms of the auditing of the account. The £5,000 every Deputy gets in a secretarial allowance should also be audited. I have taken on an extra colleague as a secretary to try to meet the enormous demand of work. However, other people, if they wish, can put the allowance in their pockets. They do not have to account for it.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious that the voted Estimates for the health services as recently passed will not produce a health service which is fair, or accessible by all, irrespective of income, and which is both effective and efficient in terms of health needs, calls on the Minister for Health and Children to immediately introduce comprehensive measures to protect the rights of patients to due, adequate and timely health services, and calls for the appointment of a health ombudsman to oversee the rights of patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The voted Estimates for the health services as recently passed will not produce a health service which is fair or accessible by all, regardless of income. The money contained in the 2001 Estimate does nothing to restore the health service spending to 1980 levels, despite the fact that the Exchequer has run budget surpluses of £6.4 billion. That is very regrettable. It is more than regrettable for the many thousands of people who are waiting for hospital beds. It is more than regrettable also for the doctors, nurses, therapists, paramedics and others who work within the health services and those people who rely on their expertise and care. It is deeply disappointing, as I have said to the Minister before, for all those people who believed the Minister's press releases and who expected a reforming and revitalising response. Instead of the stimulating injection expected, this year's Estimates will act as a sedative to the ailing health service, at best maintaining the current unacceptable <i>status </i>quo, at worst allowing a rapid deterioration of its critical condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated in a report published this evening that to meet the needs of the Republic on the same basis as the needs of those in Northern Ireland are met would require an additional 7,730 beds. There are only 3.12 beds in the Republic for every 5.12 in Northern Ireland. That is the kernel of the problem. Let us look at the facts contained in these figures and examine a few key areas which give the lie to any assertion of improvement. The total net increase in this year's Estimates over last year's is £850 million, an increase of 17%. So far, so good. When the detail is examined we discover that of the £850 million, 49.5% &ndash; almost half &ndash; £421 million, goes to pay salaries. The payment of salaries is an essential part of any Estimate and I fully concur with the need to pay good salaries. I take issue with what this Government has allowed for health spending <Col N="80" /> after making provision for salaries. The increase is now reduced to just £429 million. The reality is that this year's Estimate simply aims to continue existing programmes and to pay staff. There is no sign in this year's Estimate of the financial outlay which would allow for the realisation of the reforming and revitalising zeal often articulated by the Minister. When asked to put his money where his mouth is, he fails miserably. This Government may have increased spending but it has not made any contribution to improving health care or reforming the health services. The Minister has increased spending but has not increased or improved health care. It is strategic planning which is lacking and there is no allowance in this year's Estimate for even the sign of that planning.</P>
    <P>This is no more than we have come to expect from the Minister. In the Official Report of 8 May 2001, vol. 535, cols. 1236-37, the Minister said: </P>
    <P>It is time for a strategic look at health services . . . Seven years after the previous strategy is an opportune time to look forward in terms of a new strategy.</P>
    <P>In its fifth year in government, despite all the demographic changes and the rapidly changing health environment, this Administration has only now started to look forward. What a way to administer the health services. People's health needs are immediate and urgent but the Government has sat around noting reports, ignoring the evidence for the past four years and is only now starting to look forward. This <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude is totally unacceptable. The deluge of evidence of the need for rapid reform has swept on unnoticed by the Government as if it were a passing shower. There are well over 60 different reviews, examinations and standing committees working for the Minister. There has been no action. Everything that arises is under review.</P>
    <P>Resources are part of the problem, but nothing short of major structural changes will bring about the health services required. Such structural changes should include a covenant of rights and responsibilities for patients; a dedicated health ombudsman to oversee such a covenant; an entirely new structure of health governance with hospital boards which are citizen-based and management which should have contracts of employment that are renewable on application every six or seven years. Results to be measured based on six criteria, health gain, fair and equal access, effective delivery of appropriate health care, efficiency, satisfaction levels achieved for patients and carers, and health outcomes.</P>
    <P>Resources nearer the EU average spend on health &ndash; 8% of GDP compared to current 5.1% of GDP or 6.05% of GNP rate of spend &ndash; with value-for-money audits. I have made specific recommendations as to how the money can be used effectively &ndash; a universal health system with access based on need, not on wealth, and reform of primary care with Government investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Fine Gael will give back to our citizens trust in our health services. Trust in the health services has been eroded by the fact that our citizens cannot be confident of being treated in an appropriate way when ill, major health care services and providers have not justified the trust placed in them by our citizens, the poor, the elderly and many patients suffer second class treatment or, worse, receive no help when needed from the health care services, and a glaring lack of leadership and direction by the Government, now in its fifth year in office, in solving the critical problems in our health care system.</P>
    <P>I am aware of an elderly, mentally handicapped patient who fractured her shoulder, was taken to a hospital and was left sitting all day long without anything to eat or drink. She was only eventually seen by a doctor very late at night. This was a patient with obvious special needs. What has gone wrong with our health system and what has the Minister for Health and Children been doing to correct that wrong?</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward in the Fine Gael health plan are designed to restore trust in the health services. For this reason as well as for other reasons, Fine Gael will create a citizen-centred health service that will be trustworthy, effective, efficient and accountable to the citizens it is designed to serve. As the health plan proposed by Fine Gael is implemented, it will shape our new health care system with the following features. The new health care service will be funded to meet the health care needs of our population and will be fundamentally reoriented from curative to preventative services. This is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Only £2.50 out of every £1 million in this year's Estimates is allocated to health promotion, despite the fact that the Minister has acknowledged the importance of health promotion. This is a priority area, yet it gets £2.50 out of every £1 million. So much for prevention and so much for priority. The new health care service will be needs-led, designed and based around evidence-based needs. It will be outcome-driven and services will be measured by health outcomes.</P>
    <P>In 1980 when we were a much poorer nation, Ireland spent 8.7% of wealth on a GDP basis on health. By 2000, Ireland's spend had dropped to 5.1% of GDP. It has to be acknowledged that Irish GDP increased rapidly in recent years. Nonetheless, despite the rapid growth in the economy, Ireland is about 22nd in a list of 29 OECD countries in terms of health spending. From a low base in the early 1990s health spending has more than doubled, but it remains far behind the European average of more than 8% of GDP.</P>
    <P>More than 60,000 nurses register annually in Ireland, only half of whom are in the health services. Nursing shortages leave some Dublin operating theatres closed for one week in four. Lest anybody thinks this is just a Dublin concern, 20% of all treatments in Dublin are for people living outside Dublin. Therefore, the acute nursing shortage in Dublin is a national issue. It is <Col N="82" /> time for a Dublin weighting to be paid to nurses, together with an accommodation allowance to attract registered Irish nurses back into the system in Dublin where two-thirds of all nursing shortages exist,</P>
    <P>If the Minister spent his energies trying to bring about practical solutions such as this, instead of massaging hospital waiting list statistics, real progress could be made in our hospitals. Cancer patients would not have to go to the courts to obtain treatment. What has happened to this country, the demarcation, the courts, the Executive, the Legislature? Ministers no longer make decisions. Judges make the decisions Ministers are paid to make. It was an insult in a week when such a court case was taken, that the Minister should seek to give the impression that all is rosy with hospital waiting lists. This seems to be a case of lies, damn lies and hospital waiting list statistics.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, during the Government's term of office, what has happened to the health services? There were more than 1,800 bed closures cumulatively during 2000, more than 800 of which were due to nurse shortages. There are almost 30,000 people on hospital waiting lists nationally, more than 52% of whom are waiting for a bed in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area where the numbers on waiting lists are 19% higher than when this Government took office. Cancer patients have had their essential chemotherapy treatment delayed because of lack of beds. Four floors of a new hospital wing in the Longford Westmeath hospital, finished during the Rainbow Government's term, have lain empty for the past four years depriving the health service of 98 much needed additional beds because the Government cannot make up its mind what to do. The accident and emergency units of all hospitals are over-crowded. Medical and nursing staff are being forced to work in appalling conditions. Seriously ill patients are made to wait on trolleys for unacceptably long periods. People on modest incomes whose wage increases are almost wiped out by inflation are deprived of essential free health care by the Government. The current income limits for medical cards are so low that a husband and wife lose their eligibility if their income exceeds £144.50, or thereabouts, per week. A family with two children are excluded if their gross income exceeds £180.50 per week, and a single person cannot qualify if he or she earns more than £101 per week. As a result, only three out of four people, who qualify under the agreement which the Government has entered into with the IMO, receive medical cards because income limits are kept artificially low at a time of huge budget surpluses. It is the poor who wait on hospital waiting lists and who die younger. Fine Gael will double the medical card income limits to correct this injustice. There is under-investment in general practitioner care, and changes to the drugs payment scheme, instituted to save money &ndash; while we run budget surpluses of £6 billion per annum <Col N="83" />&ndash; mean that people with chronic conditions, such as asthma, have to pay more for their essential medication.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's comprehensive policy proposals, published in November 2000, are fully thought through and costed. Recognising the need for essential and far-reaching reform, we propose to double the income limit for medical card qualification; to extend free general practitioner services to children up to age 18 and over that age when in full time education; to extend it to all senior citizens over 65 years and to those with chronic disabilities; free medication for people with asthma; development incentives for GP's surgeries and pharmacies to encourage greater use of primary care and ease pressure on hospitals; to provide a non means-tested allowance to support persons cared for at home; to expand the number of public health nurses, home helps, speech therapists and other essential supports to carers in the community; to provide free health insurance for all with committed budgets to meet hospital needs; to increase the number of beds in the different care settings and appoint a health ombudsman who will oversee a covenant of patient's rights.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes a thorough reform of the hospital and health administration services to give citizens a real say and to provide for accountability as there is no accountability; a greater role for voluntary organisations and specific funding commitments to meet these objectives.</P>
    <P>While accepting that there are no &ldquo;quick-fix&rdquo; solutions, it is clear the Government has no solutions at all. The four wasted years have put the development and reform of the health services back by ten years. That is indefensible. The approach of a general election is only now acting like a dose of salts to this sluggish Government.</P>
    <P>It is a bitter irony that the Taoiseach could find the money and the time to fast-track his pet project, Stadium Ireland, to the tendering stage in a little over a year. Yet he leads an Administration which in its fifth year of office is still in the review stage for the health services. The facts speak for themselves. It is clear that while the Government has the resources at its disposal, provided by this House, it does not have the courage or the ability to make the fundamental changes which would deliver better health care for all. We should be ashamed that a cancer patient had to go to court to secure treatment. That is unacceptable. It is said that knowledge is power. If that is so, patients must be empowered through information so that they can understand and deal with their own health and care needs in a true spirit of partnership with the health care providers in primary, secondary and tertiary care. In the 21st century, many health professionals agree that patients can no longer be viewed as passive receivers of whatever the health care system deems to be in their best interests. Patients must be active participants in the process from start to finish. In most countries a major part of any empowerment in the <Col N="84" /> information process is a so-called patient's charter or patient's bill of rights.</P>
    <P>The original patients' charter for Ireland is minimalist and deals only with hospital in-patients and out-patients. It did not seek to enshrine rights for patients in a more formal way. It was and is often honoured more in the breach than in the observance. It is ironic that the Department of Health and Children is no longer able to supply printed copies of the patients' charter. The document is only sometimes found posted up on the notice board of hospitals around Ireland. It can be safely assumed that most patients are unaware of its existence.</P>
    <P>The problem of vindicating patients' rights is difficult but by no means intractable. Equally, many patients are unaware that they have rights. Add to the equation that in the health system patients can be reduced simply to being a case to be dealt with. Individual patients may be too ill, insecure or uninformed to stand up for their rights. In recognising patients' rights, the partnership of doctor and patient can improve the quality and outcome of medical care. We should give statutory backing to a new covenant of rights and responsibilities for patients in a new health Act. A health ombudsman should be appointed to oversee that. Two or three years ago, I would have questioned the need to appoint another ombudsman. However, in view of the proliferation of tribunals, inquiries and commissions and the amount of money being spent by the Minister on up to 60 different reviews, it seems to me that such an appointment would be money well spent. A health ombudsman would also reduce the need for litigation, the fear of accusation of medical negligence and the difficulty which that creates for some doctors in terms of nervousness in carrying out some procedures.</P>
    <P>Patients are, first and foremost, citizens. Fine Gael believes it is no longer enough simply to inject more money and resources into the existing system. We propose a complete, detailed and comprehensive reform of the health services. We have not waited until year five of this Government's term of office to make those proposals. Since 1987, Fianna Fáil has been in Government all of the time, with the exception of two and a half years and the Minister seeks to blame the Rainbow Coalition which was in office for two and a half years. He seeks to blame his predecessor, Deputy Cowan. He seeks to blame somebody, anybody other than himself; it was nothing to do with him, somebody else took the decision. I put it to him that he is the Minister for Health and Children. We know what a fright his party got in Tipperary South. There is a very much bigger fright waiting out there for the Government with its self-congratulatory approach and its efforts to be all things to all people. The Government should address the issues that really matter &ndash; traffic, housing and health. This Government is a dismal failure at a time when there is an abundance of resources available to deal with the problems. We have the resources. Where is the <Col N="85" /> leadership and the strategy? They are lacking because this Government has not got a feel for the issues or the experience, the skill, the will or the sense of injustice to provide a decent system of which we could all be proud. I commend this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for providing the opportunity to discuss this major issue. Any of us involved in the Tipperary South by-election got the message at first hand if we did not already know it. In the short time available, I wish to raise a number of issues concerning Monaghan General Hospital and I make no apology for being parochial. The ante-natal and post-natal services which should be available have been removed from that hospital despite the fact that the equipment and personnel are in Monaghan. Blood tests have to be referred to Cavan or Drogheda, although the equipment is there and the personnel is available. No junior doctors have been appointed. The health board placed a small advertisement in the newspapers for A&amp;E nurses, but it was so small as to indicate that the board is not treating the matter seriously. Last week, a midwife had to deliver a baby in Monaghan General Hospital to a Latvian woman who had only been in the country for 24 hours. This was not a fix-up, as some people would like to portray it. If the woman had been sent to Cavan or Drogheda, she would have got no further than The Diamond in Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims he can only provide money for the health boards who make the decisions. In South Tipperary, the Government claimed full responsibility for last year's money for hospital care in that area and made further commitments for the by-election. The Minister went to Roscommon, took full responsibility for the money spent there and promised additional funds to finish the job. I believe he means well. I have asked him on a number of occasions to come to Monaghan, but he is conspicuous by his absence in Monaghan General Hospital. The health board claims to be waiting since last January for a decision by the Minister on whether restructuring and extensions can go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I criticised the Minister last week in the House on the issue of medical cards and I welcome the fact that he got a ninth hour agreement with the doctors for over-70s. When will low income families get medical cards? Deputy Mitchell has given the figures. A person with £102 per week is not eligible. That is a disgrace at a time when the country is awash with money. We heard that again from the Taoiseach today. I know of an old couple who were granted two hours of home care per week recently. That is completely unacceptable for people who have given a lifetime's work to the country. I know of two cases where young handicapped persons were sent home from a respite home because of lack of staff, despite a promise that they would be there for the rest of the week. In one case, the parents were taking a well earned four days rest in Gal<Col N="86" /> way for the first time in years. This shows a total lack of management and care for such people. Can the Minister imagine what it is like for a couple to look after a handicapped person, week after week and then, having got a break for the first time in ages, to get a phone call to return home and collect their son immediately? That is not a health service of which we can be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. There is need for a health ombudsman. A health ombudsman would certainly not tolerate what is currently happening in Kerry. While I do not wish to be parochial, this is an opportunity to point out to the Minister what is really happening in the health services in County Kerry. Last week, eight women who had been called to Tralee Hospital for hysterectomy appointments were sent home because of shortage of beds and staff. This very morning, people who had been called in for gynaecological procedures, ENT procedures and various surgical procedures, were also sent home for the same reasons. That is just not acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister should undertake a major review of the situation in the Southern Health Board region. County Kerry is being totally and absolutely ignored. With the exception of Bobby O'Connell, a member of the board from Kerry, the Cork members are running rings around the other Kerry members who are all of the Minister's party. In the national development plan, only 3% of the total budget was allocated for major capital works in Kerry. That is a total disgrace. Young people in Kerry are waiting three years for orthodontic treatment. For normal, simple surgical procedures, such as gallstones or varicose veins, people in Kerry have to wait five years to be seen. That is factual information from people who are in a position to know what is happening. The subsequent surgical procedure follows on somewhat faster, but first there is a five year wait to be seen by the surgeon. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>A health ombudsman would certainly not tolerate that standard of health service for a county as large as Kerry, which will have a population of 135,000 to 140,000 in ten years' time on the basis of recent census reports. The county is totally underfunded in terms of medical services and care. Every year almost two million tourists come to it. The services available for them &ndash; emergency services are always in demand because of accidents, etc. &ndash; are inadequate to meet the massive demand. The health board arrangement whereby the county is lumped in with County Cork is not suitable for a county of its size and the increased numbers in the county during the summer.</P>
      <P>A health ombudsman would look very seriously at what is happening in County Kerry. I would like the Minister to visit Tralee General Hospital.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's motion. The Minister's tenure in the Department of Health and Children has been one of reports, strategy documents, steering groups, project teams, consultative fora, submissions and partnership facilitators. They are all a mechanism to avoid and delay the delivery of services. The Minister has failed to tackle obvious unbelievable shortcomings in the service.</P>
      <P>Elderly people are fearful of hospitalisation. If they are told by their general practitioner that they must be hospitalised, they are afraid of going to an accident and emergency department, spending hours on a trolley and being seen after that time and told to go home, that there is no acute bed in which to accommodate them for a night or the duration of their sickness. How can we expect elderly people to have confidence in a Minister, Government or health board which delivers such a service? They are simply afraid, and the Minister must be aware of this and have seen it. If he has not witnessed it, then it is time he went to the coalface to see what is happening to patients. Elderly people are wishing to be left and die in the comfort of their own homes. It is sad at a time of plenty, and in the era of the Celtic tiger, that this is the best we can do to deliver a service to the elderly.</P>
      <P>A couple of months ago the cardiovascular health strategy was announced in a blaze of glory. The reality is, as the Minister must be aware, that it is now in a shambles. It will not be proceeded with because the Minister is not prepared to get the funding from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, for the hospitals in order that they can provide the infrastructure necessary to deliver the service. Why then do we wonder at the high rate of coronary deaths? We do not have a service to deliver. There is an inequity between the east and west. We do not have the service or infrastructure to deliver it in the west. The Minister will respond by establishing a new consultative forum which will produce another report.</P>
      <P>We are told the report resulting from the consultative process which has taken place for a new service is with the Department. It highlights the very matters about which we have spoken for the past four years in the House. There is nothing new, and the Minister and his predecessor have failed to tackle them. The Minister is afraid to take on the vested interests of those who deliver health services. There is a two tier system, a problem the Minister has failed to tackle. I am confident he will not tackle it in the next couple of months which may remain in the lifetime of the Government as it is election time. He wants to say there is a consultative process and a new plan, which will again end up on a shelf gathering dust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Each time the Minister comes to the House for a debate on a Private Members' <Col N="88" /> motion on health &ndash; the same was true of his predecessor &ndash; he reams out the same statistics and outlines the amount of funding allocated to the Department as opposed to the previous Government. It reminds me of the politician who, when accosted by their spouse as to the reason they are never home, responds by saying, &ldquo;Did I not take you to the chamber of commerce dinner? Should that not do you?&rdquo;  That is not a satisfactory answer from the politician, and it is not satisfactory for the Minister to tell us tonight how much money he spends. If he examines the speeches made by Deputy Cowen when Minister for Health and Children, he will see they are exactly the same, as very little has been done apart from money being allocated. For example, Deputy Deenihan referred to a three and a half year waiting list in the south eastern region for orthodontic services. In the ERHA area the waiting times can be up to seven years. Recently I encountered a parent whose child was told in 1996 they were in category one. In fairness the child has been seen, but only in the past couple of days. I realise there is a difficulty in recruiting professional staff, but has the Minister advertised abroad to fill these positions? Each time the response is that certain measures have been taken, but the positions have not been adequately filled.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to expectant mothers, an issue dear to my heart. Under the health services in-patient regulations of 1991 a consultant's public patients must ordinarily be accommodated in public beds. This recommendation was made by the commission on health funding and included in the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991. For the life of me I cannot understand the reason an expectant mother who wishes to attend in a public capacity cannot avail of a private bed if she so wishes, and pay for it, when the time for delivery comes. I would like the Minister to examine this and make a special case for expectant mothers. It should not be too difficult to overcome this problem.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the charter of rights for hospital patients introduced in August 1992 states that each person shall be given an individual appointment time, a matter on which I tabled a parliamentary question. I do not know what that means as in the hospitals with which I am familiar public patients are not given an individual appointment time. If the Minister visits the Coombe or Holles Street hospitals, or the hospitals in Kilkenny or Clonmel, he will find that expectant mothers who are public patients are allotted group times. I ask him to re-examine this with a view to people being given an individual appointment time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent County Wicklow and part of County Carlow. We are probably unique in that we do not have a general hospital. The hospitals in Loughlinstown, Naas and, to a lesser extent, Tallaght serve the area. I do not know if the Minister has visited Loughlinstown hospital, where there are many problems. It is an old union house in which it is very difficult to accommodate modern needs. I realise the Minister has allocated <Col N="89" /> some funding for it, but we can see what has happened in Naas where it appears the programme for development will be inadequate when completed in the next year or two. There are already indications it will not suffice in terms of the needs of the area. I would appreciate if the Minister would examine the idea of Tallaght Hospital serving the needs of south and west Wicklow while Naas Hospital is under construction. Currently, it is operating out of cabins.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman appeared before the Strategic Management Committee last week, dealing with health. He pointed out a few cases where patients believed they had not been treated correctly by consultants. That day I said that many patients approach consultants in an Oliver Twist-like manner. The time when people were subservient to the professions, be it doctors, solicitors, consultants or whatever, should be past. It is time the Minister took this on board and stopped consultants dictating to the Department and patients about what can be done.</P>

A year and a half later no-one has even been recommended for the position. I ask the Minister to cut out the red tape facing Comhairle na nOspidéal when making appointments of consultants to hospitals so that we can get the consultants on the ground and allow them to do the work necessary.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;commends the Government for its unparalleled increases in health funding;</P>
      <P>&ndash;fully supports the robust targeting of these funds which will lead to substantial improvements across the wide spectrum of health and personal services; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;continues to endorse the process adopted to facilitate the development of a new health strategy which will be the focal <Col N="90" /> point of the delivery of health services in the next five to seven years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues on producing a motion for debate which so succinctly manages to summarise the key issue which lies between the Government on the one hand and the Opposition parties on the other. The contrast is between a policy based on credible planning, a comprehensive agenda and unprecedented resources, one which is based on the vain political hope of an Opposition that its buzzwords will be enough to distract the public from a complete lack of substance.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has said it wants to use health as a political wedge issue. As a result much of this debate will inevitably be taken up with the business of politics. So be it, if the Opposition wants a political debate, it can have it. However, I make it clear that the Government will continue its work on completing the most comprehensive and far-reaching series of health reforms seen for over three decades. In the few weeks since we last debated health in Private Members' time, there has been unprecedented expansions in resources, new staff have been hired, waiting lists reduced and the reform agenda progressed. Waiting lists have been reduced by a further 1,500 since our last debate and medical cards have been introduced for all people over 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>With respect to Deputy Deenihan's comments, I wish to put on record that the waiting list over the past year in Tralee General Hospital has declined from 457 to 134, a drop of 323, which by any standard is a very significant decrease in the waiting list of a single hospital.</P>

I know that the Opposition would prefer I did not keep raising such an uncomfortable issue, but once again I ask it to explain to the House why we should believe it can be trusted to cut waiting lists when its record shows it cutting waiting list funding. I have been trying for a year to get an explanation. Three hours is more than enough time for Opposition Deputies to get their act together and utter even a few words of explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Noonan, sat down and discussed their priorities. <Col N="91" /> They discussed what they wanted to do with the health system and made decisions. The key decision was to cut by 20% the funding dedicated to reducing public waiting lists. The men who now say this is the number one issue which takes priority over everything else put it at the bottom of the pile and, even though they were engaged in a failed attempt to spend their way back into power, chose to implement a decision which directly disadvantaged public patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is more, on the night of 22 January 1997, Deputies Mitchell and McManus went through the lobbies of this House to support the cutback. The Government is willing and able to justify its record. It is about time the Opposition showed some semblance of bravery and explained its decision.</P>
      <P>I welcome the continued series of debates which we are having in this House about the direction of our health services. It is striking that this motion contains less detail than anything previously tabled by the Opposition. Deputy Noonan has set out the basic policy of his party very clearly. Health is to be treated as the all purpose electoral and political football. Any promise, any attack and any policy U-turn required are to be deployed. Deputy Mitchell has been told to follow his leader and say and do anything necessary, and he is loyally following orders.</P>
      <P>The result has been a policy which is a mile wide and an inch deep with a heavy reliance on good, old-fashioned, deliberate misrepresentation and distortion. I have no doubt that in the next 12 months we will see a virtuoso demonstration of political ambulance chasing dressed up in the cloak of a lightly given and easily discarded empathy. In the few weeks since we last debated health policy we have seen this approach in action with a vengeance. My personal favourite has been Fine Gael's ever flexible policy on health service funding. On 2 February last year, Deputy Shatter, who was then in charge of Fine Gael health policy, said to the House:</P>
      <P>Whether the necessary reform can be brought about by the introduction of a universal health insurance system is questionable. What is needed is less, not more bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Soon after Deputy Noonan's palace coup he began to try to love-bomb the Labour Party and announced on RTE that his party would adopt Labour's policy of moving to a universal private health insurance model of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>However, once the many fundamental problems with this proposal began to be reported by some commentators, Deputy Noonan <Col N="92" /> began a rapid and skilfully executed retreat. As quickly as 28 May he told the <i>Irish Independent </i>that he was not now proposing to move immediately to such a system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This was, he said, because to do so would cause chaos. Instead he was now proposing that new capacity would be built, new staff hired, all the problems would be solved and then the system would, at some point in the far distant future, move to the universal private health insurance system he had previously been so enthusiastic about.</P>

      <P>Not quite as good as this, but good nonetheless, have been the contortions which the Opposition continues to get itself into on how best to criticise the Government on spending levels. The initial critique was that we were deliberately underspending. In the face of continued unprecedented expansions in spending, the Opposition started to move away from this. On 27 February of this year a Fine Gael motion, supported by Labour, signalled a dramatic shift of attack, with a move to one based on the idea that there is loads of money going but we are not getting anything for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside for one moment the basic factual inaccuracy in the idea that real service improvements are not being realised from investment, the Opposition has not been able to hold to a consistent line on this matter. The Labour Party has criticised the Government for not agreeing with the recommendation of the European Commission to hold back spending on services, but Deputy McManus returned, as recently as last week, to the idea that the reason there <Col N="93" /> are problems in health is that we do not spend enough.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has told this House that the budget day spending announced by the Minister for Finance, a large proportion of which is going into health services, was excessive and would, &ldquo;put our prosperity at risk&rdquo;, yet he and Deputy Mitchell are now saying that we do not spend nearly enough on health. They have also continued Deputy Bruton's favourite criticism that there is a lack of efficiency within the system which, they say, has meant there is nothing new coming out as a result of new spending inputs.</P>

They have not mentioned any group, sector or even unit in the system which they believe is inefficient.

      <P>The only thing that is clear is that the Opposition will continue to change tack depending on where they think the political opportunity is. The only consistent policy on spending has been from this Government which, from day one, has followed an approach of delivering sustained and major expansions in health funding.</P>
      <P>Almost every day we hear statements from the Opposition claiming that things have never been worse. Last week Deputy McManus said &ldquo;the system has got worse&rdquo; and &ldquo;the crisis is deepening rather than lessening&rdquo;. We are still waiting for Deputy Noonan to justify his statement on RTE that &ldquo;the health services were significantly better . . . four years ago when I left the Department of Health than they are now . . . Now you can check that out objectively with anybody&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was it better that 90,000 fewer treatments were carried out in 1997 than last year? Was it better that there were 3,500 fewer residential, day and <Col N="94" /> respite care places for people with disabilities? Was it better that there were 400 fewer community nursing unit places for older people? Was it better that there was no capital modernisation programme under way? Was it better that there were fewer doctors and nurses in our hospitals?</P>
    <P>Continually, and with determination, the Opposition refuses to acknowledge any improvements whatsoever, no matter how clear. Last year there were over 4,000 more doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics working in our system than there were in 1997. These are real professionals delivering real quality care to real people. The Opposition needs to learn that progress is made in steps. It is our job to make sure that these steps are made in the right direction and that they will deliver us all to the destination as quickly as possible.</P>

They dashed out breathless denunciations of the Government using a wide variety of attacks. These were duly reported and almost as soon as Deputies McManus and Mitchell had reached their peak of righteous indignation, they lapsed into a deafening silence when they heard that the policy was being delivered and delivered on time. The bandwagon ground to a halt as soon as they jumped on board. Once again it was shown that it was not the substance of the issue which drove their policies and commentary but crude political opportunism. That is what drove their reaction to the issues of last week.</P>

I agree with the Deputy that her Government's policies have more relevance to historical inquiry than contemporary realities. It is a pity she did not realise this when supporting them only four years ago.</P>
      <P>If one wants to look at the difference in policies the most obvious area for comparison is hospital treatments. The extra 90,000 treatments carried out last year show progress, but we are determined to go significantly further.</P>

      <P>As has been widely recognised, waiting lists are not uniquely Irish and they have not emerged recently. In spite of the major increases in hospital activity and the numbers of people receiving treatment, waiting lists are still there and they remain an issue which must be tackled. They are being tackled, and that is the difference between us and our predecessors. Our increased population and, in particular, our increased number of people in groups likely to require hospital treatment, has been a key driver in the continued existence of waiting lists. There has also been a lack of bed capacity and the difficulty in catching up with previous under-investment.</P>
      <P>Our policy has been very clear. We have shown a consistent commitment to improving the position in relation to public waiting lists. The figures show that the waiting list at the end of March was 4,101 lower than it was in June 1997. The proper comparison should be with the figure at the end of 1997 because this more accurately reflects the results of the Quinn-Noonan health settlement of January 1997. This figure shows that the lists are down by 5,854.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputies McManus and Mitchell come up with ever more ingenious ways of trying to pretend that the lists are worse today than they were when we took office, but no matter what <Col N="96" /> way they try to twist the figures, they cannot get away from the fact that they are down. I give a particular mention to Deputy McManus's extraordinary innovation of last week where she said that the proper comparison was between the latest figures and those of December 1996. Even for the Labour Party this requires some neck. Apparently we are to be held accountable for the major increases which came about in the waiting lists at the end of the Quinn-Noonan health partnership which, as we know, resulted in a 20% cutback in waiting list funding in the 1997 package.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this finally provides the answer to the question of why Fine Gael and Labour voted through the cutback in waiting list funding which directly led to the lists becoming longer by thousands. It was our fault, we forced them to do it and we forced them to increase waiting lists by an unprecedented 6,600, or 27%, during their period in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ours is a health system which has evolved at varying paces over the last two centuries. It is now three decades since the last significant structural reform of the system and there is no doubt that the level and quality of care which our people have a right to expect requires a significant programme of reform and development. The health system is not a simple structure with basic levers to be pulled whenever a given output is required. Delivering a responsive, equitable and high quality hospital system for example, does not just require a reform of hospital care, a range of structural issues have to be addressed, including primary and continuing care systems and basic manpower deployment, contracts and planning.</P>
      <P>What the public want are not promises but action and they realise that anyone who says &ldquo;we have all the answers, here they are&rdquo; cannot be trusted. Sustainable action which will deliver on the ground requires not just one move, but dozens of interrelating initiatives. If one is going to build a new system, one needs foundations and this requires a progressive programme of research and negotiation which was completely absent until the change of Government in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Opposition's attack on our process for delivering a new health strategy has been to say that we should have done it before now. We could have produced a strategy by now. We could have cobbled something together a few years ago and published it with a great fanfare but if we had, we would have repeated the basic flaws of the 1994 document published under Deputy Howlin's stewardship. It had strengths, but very few people were consulted during preparation and it set out no agenda for investment and development.</P>

      <P>It talked about equity but said nothing about how to achieve it. When Deputy Noonan's golden era followed, there was no new approach and no attempt to begin the work to develop one.</P>
      <P>A programme of fundamental research and negotiation has been ongoing and is already making a difference. The starting point for the development of the new strategy has been a series of crucial reports which examine in great detail fundamental issues relating to the future of our health system. The medical manpower report and report on junior hospital doctor working practices have shown the way forward to a radical improvement in the level and quality of hospital care. A consultant led, round-the-clock service in our hospitals will make a huge difference and would represent the most significant development in hospital care in many decades.</P>
      <P>Nurses have to be central to developing our health services. There are more working in our system than before, but we have to help them to make the full contribution at all levels which they are ready and able to do. The Commission on Nursing has shown us what we must do to attract, train, utilise and retain nurses of the highest calibre.</P>
      <P>A detailed study is showing us how to work to significantly improve the effectiveness and accessibility of the full range of primary care services. A value for money audit is, for the first time, detailing exactly how resources are deployed and utilised within the system and, vitally, a detailed strategic assessment of the capacity of our hospitals is being finalised. I do not know how a programme of development and reform could be developed in the absence of this work &ndash; these are the fundamental building blocks of reform which we have developed and initiated &ndash; but apparently the Opposition thinks it can be.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the biggest point where we disagree is that we think it is worthwhile to ask health professionals and the public what they think should be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 2,000 submissions have been received from the public. In addition, a national consultative forum has been established representing a large cross section of stakeholders. Its sub-groups have worked extensively on detailed areas and a further meeting of the full forum will take place next week. At the same time, work is being completed on how to bring together diverse needs into a coherent short, medium and long-term strategy. We have also brought together a group <Col N="98" /> of independent international experts to evaluate the strategy as it develops. The lessons of the Opposition's various health policy documents demonstrate clearly that our approach is the more credible and effective. While Fine Gael continues to make it up as it goes along, Labour simply cannot seem to decide whether its is a policy document setting out its intentions or a discussion document requiring major work before it can be finalised. When it wants to claim it has the answers it says &ldquo;we have a plan, we will do this&rdquo;. When it wants to avoid answering difficult questions it says &ldquo;this is only a discussion document, come back to us when it is a definite policy&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We must realise that reform means that many people from the top downwards will have to change the way they do business. As I have said on many occasions, the <i>status quo</i> is not an option. We cannot do everything at once. We simply do not have the capacity or the resources, fiscal or personnel, to move on every single issue at the same time and at the same speed. This will be the case no matter what resourcing benchmark one adopts. We must all work strategically and systematically to identify our priorities and address them in a more focused way than hereto<Col N="99" /> fore. The Opposition's approach of pretending one can have it all and have it now, lacks even the most basic credibility.</P>
    <P>Reform is a challenge for everyone at every level of the system. We must be in a position to say to the wider society that we will use the resources we are given to the greatest possible effect to tackle the issues of most concern to the public.</P>

      <P>I am very encouraged by the people's responses during the consultation process for the strategy, particularly in terms of the development of quality, care-driven accountability systems. The Government is not interested in wasting years chasing the end of a health care rainbow and losing the opportunity to get moving on a more challenging systematic development and reform of the system.</P>
      <P>The only proposal &ndash; which is not a new one &ndash; in the motion before the House relates to the establishment of a health ombudsman. The establishment of a health ombudsman may be an important initiative in assisting the development of a patient-centred system but such a person could achieve little or nothing in the absence of the necessary resources and reforms we have outlined. The establishment of an ombudsman will be considered in the context of the forthcoming health strategy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan said he wants an election with health as the issue. I have every confidence that next year's election will give the public a clear choice on the issue of health. The choice will be between a Government which has shown real progress across a wide range of issues, one which has set out a detailed and comprehensive plan for the future&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me pleasure to set out the real improvements effected by the Government in the area of health since 1997. At that time, the people passed their verdict on the Fine Gael-Labour coalition's record on health; they put it out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under funding was the Rainbow coalition's hallmark in the area of health and neglect was <Col N="100" /> the hallmark of their services for older people. This was the Government which provided the most meagre pension increases, averaging just more than £2 per annum. This was also the Government which failed older people's health needs.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office in 1997, there was an urgent need for investment in services for older people, services which Fine Gael and Labour totally and incredibly neglected. We created an additional 800 posts in services for the elderly, 400 additional long-term care places and 1,000 day places. Subvention rates have increased by 25%. Spending is up from £10 million in 1997 to £57 million in 2001.</P>
    <P>Had the Opposition parties invested and spent in this area and started to train professionals when they had the power and money to do so, they could have alleviated much needless anguish. Instead, they abrogated their responsibilities and it was left to this Fianna Fáil-led Government to make reforms and improvements.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ring need only look at County Mayo to see the increased funding provided and improvements made since the Government took office. Last year's winter initiative at a cost of £25 million alleviated some of the urgent pressure on acute beds by placing older people in more appropriate facilities such as nursing homes. We are determined to automatically provide medical cards to people over 70 years of age and we reached agreement last week with the IMO on this issue.</P>
      <P>Spending on palliative care has increased from £3 million to £15 million in 2001. Palliative care services will be extended this year in all health board areas and the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care will be published.</P>
      <P>The Government is enhancing existing community care services and developing new ones and is placing special emphasis on rehabilitation and stroke care services. Opposition Deputies criticised the Government for its lack of a prevention programme. We have put in place programmes for the elderly in regard to osteoporosis, glaucoma, accidents at home, dietary deficiencies, diabetes, blood pressure and stroke prevention. This is the kind of action required in the area of health. The Government has substituted the lack of will and inclination which characterised the previous Government with commitment and reform.</P>

    <P>Where was the leader of the Fine Gael Party in the mid-1990s when older people received meagre pensions and when health services for the elderly were completely inadequate? As Minister <Col N="101" /> for Health, he was based in Hawkin's House but he did nothing.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to come between two Mayo men. I know how to look after myself but not that well. I will comment on the Minister's speech which was the most defensive, petty, cowardly, dishonest piece of propaganda I have witnessed from any Cabinet Minister since becoming a Member of this House. Considering the record of Fianna Fáil Ministers in particular, that is saying something. The Minister for Health and Children is deep in his bunker and does not intend to come out of it and, unlike him, I do not intend to waste my time on inaccuracies and petty mindedness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion. The Labour Party fully supports the call by Fine Gael for the introduction of comprehensive measures to protect the rights of patients to due, adequate and timely health services and the call for the appointment of a health ombudsman to oversee the rights of these patients. This unity of purpose between the main Opposition parties stands out in sharp contrast to the definitions and confusion evident on a daily basis within the Government on a number of vital political issues. There is no more vital political issue today than health and health care reform. There is no more indictment of Government failure than the long queues of sick people waiting for treatment in care, the number of over-stressed and over-worked staff who try to provide excellent medical care in less than excellent conditions and the <Col N="102" /> growing injustice in our health service that militates against those who are sick and happen to have low incomes. This is an injustice that would be considered barbaric in any other European country, yet it is not only tolerated but is being actively exacerbated by the Government.</P>
    <P>Despite the good work done by the thousands of doctors, nurses and highly trained professionals, the average life expectancy of an Irish baby boy is 73 years, lower than the EU average and much lower than countries such as Italy, Sweden or Britain. An Irish baby girl has a life expectancy of 78.6 years compared to an EU average of 80 years. Our record on infant mortality is no better. The death rate among babies under one year is the fourth highest in the EU.</P>
    <P>We are one of the richest countries in Europe yet, paradoxically, we are one of its sickest. Instead of investing properly in our health service, the current Government policy ensures that Ireland lags behind other EU countries in terms of money, medical staff and facilities. Even today after four years in office at a time of unprecedented wealth, the Government refuses to invest sufficient money in our health service to meet the needs of our sick and elderly.</P>
    <P>When the country was on its knees economically, we spent more on health proportionately than we do today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Today, in effect, the Government spends less of the country's wealth on the health service than was spent, for example, in 1980. That is an utter disgrace. At a time when we have fewer consultants and general practitioners than the EU average and only over half the EU average number of hospital beds, less than two-thirds of the EU average <i>per capita</i> is spent on health services. The effects of that are evident in the daily suffering and pain of thousands of people. Almost 27,000 people are still waiting for treatment, an estimated 150,000 people are waiting for an appointment to see a specialist, 54% of adults on the waiting list are waiting longer than 12 months and 74% of children are waiting more than six months. There are also the individual scandals. Janette Byrne had to go to court to get a hospital bed and cancer treatment; a constituent of mine, a young man from Wicklow who was diagnosed as having cancer eight weeks ago, is still waiting for access to chemotherapy and radiotherapy; and a child in Waterford was in the news recently because he is waiting five years to see a specialist.</P>
      <P>The pressure on resources is now so great that, for public patients, routine treatments must often wait until they become an emergency, but we all know that private patients can fast track access to a hospital bed. Meanwhile A&amp;E departments are chronically overloaded by the demand. Seriously ill patients, many of them elderly, must often wait on trolleys in corridors for admission and sometimes they wait for days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> The crisis is not confined to the hospital service. Ireland is seriously under-provided with general practitioners, the front line of health care. The World Health Organisation defines the primary service of GPs as &ldquo;the central function and main focus&rdquo; of a country's health system, yet primary care is still under-funded and under-developed here and it is still not viewed as central to our system of health care.</P>
    <P>Money alone will not solve the health crisis but it is needed as part of the solution. The need to tackle the gross inequality within our health service is self-evident, yet the Government has been unwilling or unable to state how it would deal with the greatest political challenge in health care reform, the provision of a guarantee to all our citizens of medical care when they need it, regardless of their income or geographic location within a reasonable time and distance.</P>
    <P>That failure by the Government has been perceived as caution, timidity or lack of political direction or know-how on the part of a Taoiseach and Cabinet who are concentrated on priorities other than the needs of our sick and elderly people. While Bertie concentrates on the Bertie Bowl, his Minister for Health and Children gets a clip around the ear from the Minister for Finance for having the temerity to seek additional funding for the health service. The media spin has been created, primarily by the Minister, Deputy Martin, that he is the people's champion when it comes to health.</P>
    <P>The Government announcement in the budget that it intended to give medical cards to all people over 70 years of age was made without any preparation or prior arrangement with the medical profession. Inequity is inherent in a policy of giving medical cards regardless of income to the over 70s while maintaining income limits at an atrociously low level for anyone younger than 70. As one Cork GP put it, &ldquo;the merchant princes are getting medical cards while the gardeners working for the merchant princes are not&rdquo;. We supported the provision because we wanted it to be extended to any group in our society at present&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but we challenged and continue to challenge the Minister and the Government for refusing to deal with the low levels of medical card eligibility. Anyone who voiced concern at the time this change was announced was attacked, as I was, by the Minister of Health and Children and his dutiful Fianna Fáil backbenchers, as taking the doctors' side on the issue. That was the spin &ndash; we were all in league with the doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government refused to address the issue of inequity when it was raised and the doctors inevitably went for the jugular. The Government was easy meat, as far as the IMO was concerned, <Col N="104" /> when it came to striking a deal. The deal has been struck and the sheer hypocrisy of this Minister for Health and Children has been laid bare. Not only has he failed to tackle inequality within our health system, he has connived with the powerful medical lobby to strike a grubby deal which will have financial and social implications in any future negotiations with general practitioners.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me speak, Minister. Shame on the Minister. He capitulated to the doctors to save his face and to save the Government from further embarrassment. Far from standing firm, the Minister for Health and Children was desperate to make a deal, any deal, to deliver on a budget promise. The result is that doctors are to be incentivised to treat the over 70s who are coming into the GMS for the first time now and who, by definition, are better off, some of them substantially better off, than those who already have a medical card.</P>
      <P>The Minister has created a two tier medical card system in a health system already riddled with inequalities and based on a medical apartheid that is an affront to all decent people. He has introduced apartheid into the GMS. Doctors will be rewarded by a figure, which has been publicised as £345, for caring for these new &ldquo;gold card&rdquo; over 70s patients while they will be inevitably penalised conversely for caring for their poor patients over 70 who currently have a medical card. The terrible truth is that these are, generally speaking, the patients who need more medical care because of their social and economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>This is a despicable and shameful deal. No weasel words from nice Minister Martin can disguise the ugly reality &ndash; this deal is a Government surrender to vested medical interests. The doctors saw their opportunity and took it. The deal has been done because this is a desperate Government in all senses of the word. After more than four wasted years, Fianna Fáil is about to face an electorate that has not ever been so well versed in the inadequacies of our health service. The public is well versed because it consists of those who are forced to wait for life-saving treatment and frustrated health professionals unable to do their jobs properly. They know other countries provide health care on the basis of need, not on the disgracefully unjust basis whereby, when it comes to obtaining health care, money talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction of the new two-tier medical card scheme, money is talking even louder. Deputy Martin bears responsibility. He will leave a legacy as the Minister who deepened the divide in the Irish health care system at a time when he had unprecedented resources that could have transformed it. He could have chosen to pay doctors extra money while maintaining equity in the GMS scheme. However, he chose to deepen the divide, and in doing so, set a negative <Col N="105" /> precedent for any further negotiations with doctors.</P>
    <P>The Government has not provided for a health service that is fair or accessible to all, irrespective of income. It did this knowingly. It chose to have priorities other than the provision of essential high-quality services delivering excellence to all. It is the poor and the sick, however, who have paid the price of Fianna Fáil and PD politics.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is committed to a new start in health care and to delivering a fair and good service. It is committed to ensuring high morale among those who deliver health care. It is not being prescriptive. The Minister for Health and Children insists on twisting our words, but I realise he is desperate and has to say something. The Labour Party has always said that its intention is to provide a universal health care service of excellent quality. Such changes will be made on the basis of meeting people's needs. We have described how we will do that. If someone thinks of a better method, we are more interested than anybody else to hear it. Nobody has thought of one. The Minister has remained silent, and tonight he has disguised his silence with bluster. He refused to even begin to address the problem of inequality in the health service or state how he might do so. That is a shameful and despicable position for a Minister for Health and Children to be in, given that he has unprecedented resources.</P>
    <P>After being entrusted with the task of improving the health service by the Irish people more than four years ago, the Government has failed, and failed disastrously. It is time for a new start in health care, but it is clear that we need a new Government to deliver it.</P>

      <P>I hope it is not indicative of my contribution that the Minister for Health and Children leaves as I begin. I do not take it as a personal insult as I have some understanding of his role, as does the Leas-Ceann Comhairle. I have had the great honour of holding that office for 22 months.</P>
      <P>I am interested in hearing the contribution of the Minister to this debate. The clear, overwhelming view of the people, expressed in South Tipperary, Wexford, Mayo, Dún Laoghaire and wherever one listens, is one of total dismay at the quality of the health service. The constant repetition of the mantra that we are spending more money or that there are so many millions of pounds available is meaningless to people who are in desperate need. The people are not fools. They plainly see that the health service they require and demand is not available to them and theirs. The Government must be held accountable. Petty bickering is not the way to resolve complex issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stewardship of the current Administration has proceeded for four years, longer than the terms of the two previous governments. It was an unprecedented period of wealth that could have brought about root-and-branch change. In this light, I found it instructive and somewhat amusing <Col N="106" /> that the cornerstone issue enunciated by Deputy Martin was the waiting list initiative. I pioneered and introduced that when I became Minister for Health to tackle problems of waiting times in 1993.</P>
    <P>When I introduced that innovative scheme, for which I travelled the country negotiating with health boards, it was not designed to be ongoing. It was meant to address the problems of inadequate beds, equipment, operating theatres and all the other deficiencies that we identified. We put in that investment so the medical profession would engage as they had not ever done before in tackling the problem of waiting lists. It did so in the subsequent 18 months, but we have not seen the transformation afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to hear the Minister for Health and Children talk in terms of the health strategy that I introduced. He and his immediate predecessor, Deputy Cowen, did not see any deficiencies in it. I have been at many public fora where he or Deputy Cowen quoted the health strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; as the blueprint for health service delivery. They are putting in place this new strategy belatedly. The Minister should be generous enough to acknowledge the work that was done before him.</P>
    <P>I smiled wryly when I read a comment by former Minister Máire Geoghegan-Quinn in <i>The Irish Times</i> that I had wasted my time on a health strategy. The fact that she was in the Cabinet that voted it through was unimportant. The strategic involvement of a plan in health service delivery is recognised even by the most recalcitrant and backward-looking Members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Will the Government provide an answer to two problems in the South-Eastern Health Board area pertaining to oncology and rheumatology services? There is no consultant oncologist in the South East. People are being sent to Cork and Dublin to add to already overburdened waiting lists. It is not good enough that other Deputies and I should have to deal directly with the families of people waiting for cancer treatment who cannot get it. Their case is unanswerable and it shames me as a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>Where rheumatology services are concerned, I have a letter from Dr. Darragh Foley-Nolan, consultant rheumatologist, to Mr. Richard Dooley, manager of Waterford regional hospital. It states that the waiting time for a first consultation is two years and nine months. It is absurd for the Minister of State to speak of services for the elderly when people in the South East, as a matter of routine, wait nearly three years for a first consultation to deal with rheumatism and its attendant pain and suffering. If I had time, I would read the letter because it speaks of the possibility of missing treatable malignancies. I want the Administration to answer these questions, not bluster a minute longer.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not remarkable that in this day and age we have finally come to the stage where we are to ask the leaders of political parties to provide audited accounts for the vast sums they get from the Exchequer? We can see what happens in relation to other Departments. If a farmer makes a mistake of one digit on his application form for headage payments, he is out. If someone getting rent allowance is caught doing a few hours work, their allowance is cut off. For years the leaders of political parties have received millions of pounds without having to produce accounts. This measure would not have been introduced if a forum in Dublin Castle had not found unfortunate discrepancies in those accounts. The founding fathers of the State had different motivations, even if there were no leaders' allowances at that time, and there would have been no need to audit those accounts. Unfortunately we have had episodes involving blank cheques and shirts which have brought this measure about. It is a good move.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept some amendments to the Bill to improve accountability. Deputies who are members of the major political parties do not get one penny of the leader's allowance, which all goes into the leaders' fund and is administered through the leader's office, providing badly needed backup staff. However, Independent Members will get an allowance of £22,000 and will not have to account to anyone for it. They can spend it as they please. It is not taxable. In a sense, therefore, it is the equivalent of £44,000 in income. They can do what they like with it: they can use it to win elections or entertain their friends, in whatever way they please. The rest of us are then at a big disadvantage, particularly if one is sharing a constituency with someone who has this allowance; one is then at a major disadvantage when it comes to constituency work or holding one's seat. It is unfair that Independent Deputies will get that money without being subject to scrutiny. The Minister should look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also look at fundraising and corporate donations. It is a sad part of democracy in Ireland that we have to raise funds. When I joined our political party first many of our meetings were dominated by how we would raise a few pounds to keep the ship afloat in elections. It was terrible drudgery which drove away many good people, as they were coming to meetings for months and the first item on the agenda was selling tickets or fundraising for elections. Thankfully much of that has now gone, though when I was elected first 12 years ago we were £38,000 in debt in my constituency. It was terrible drudgery clearing it but thankfully we did so and the Minister <Col N="108" /> will be happy to hear we have enough money to fight the next election.</P>

      <P>We will take them on and do our best to keep two tigerish fighters like them at bay. I am confident we can do so.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that Fine Gael is the only party which does not accept corporate donations any more. It was interesting to hear the Labour Party talk about how it wants corporate donations phased out. However, it did not say a word about trade union subscriptions. I find it ironic that when one looks at donations after elections, Labour Party candidates and Members have received substantial sums from trade unions, while the rest of us ordinary mortals do not. We must be anti-trade unions, though I am an active, paid up member of a trade union and do not receive anything from the trade union movement when I stand for election, yet our Labour Party colleagues get substantial sums. How can one marry the idea of having no corporate donations while having trade union subscriptions? Those subscriptions are not all from people who vote the one way; they are from members of my party and the Minister's party who are members of those unions, yet their subscriptions go towards funding the Labour Party at election time. I find it ironic that that party is against corporate donations while accepting trade union subscriptions. It should go the whole hog if it is to go down that route at all.</P>
      <P>The way we run the business of the House is also tied into this measure, when one sees how the political parties are treated. The way we run our business militates against the bigger parties. When there is a debate on a Bill or motion, a number of Members from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party can speak, but an Independent Member can probably get speaking time at the expense of many others. That is not fair. Even tonight we are restricted in time. When I entered the Dáil first, which is not that long ago, though the Minister is here much longer, generally there were no restrictions on speaking times. A Member could speak for as long as they liked and some spoke for three to five hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and we guillotine Bills too quickly, which prevents many backbenchers from making valuable contributions. Every Member would like to contribute on health, the topic of this week's Private Members' Business, but we end up having two or three minutes to speak. What good is that in a debate on something as fundamental as health? We need a radical overhaul of the way we do our business. We should reach out more to individual Members of larger parties, who do not get the chance to speak and are unfairly treated in comparison with Independents and members of smaller parties. On the Order of Business the leaders of small parties get almost as much time as the leaders of the big parties. That is militating against the bigger parties and making matters very difficult for us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to resources. Members are very restricted now and must keep documents on all issues relating to finance at election time; one must almost keep track of how many times one sneezes in a day.</P>
      <P>There is a great burden on Members and we need additional resources. The Minister has been very generous in looking after Members' interests. I hope he can see his way to giving additional secretarial services to Members which will not be given to political parties. There is no point allocating an additional 15 or 20 secretaries to Fine Gael because that will be of no use to me as a backbencher. If I get the additional secretary, I can use him or her for research and so on.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for Front Bench spokespersons to scrutinise legislation, Estimates and so on properly. We met the Minister five times last week on Bills and other documentation from the Department of Finance. He has a plethora of capable civil servants to help him out. While Deputy Jim Mitchell has an assistant, he and I are virtually on our own in trying to scrutinise what is happening. That must change. Front Bench spokespersons should get additional assistance. Perhaps there should be a system whereby, in Deputy Mitchell's case, a person from the Department of Finance would be seconded to him for the period. This would mean Deputy Mitchell would have access to sources and information within the Department and that a civil servant would be able to provide a professional service to him. There is the danger that a spokesperson might feel the civil servant might not provide him or her with independent advice, but I believe our civil servants are sufficiently professional to be able to provide such a service adequately and well to allow the type of scrutiny needed for Bills, Estimates and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a key element of the Government's strategy in helping to restore public confidence in the political system. We know there has been a deterioration in that confidence in politics and politicians and this is one of the <Col N="110" /> elements we are introducing to help restore that level of confidence.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons this legislation is being brought forward is to ensure there is a mandatory statutory audit of all the leader's allowance accounts from now on. Until now, there has not been any such statutory audit and it is a welcome development that it should be put in place.</P>
      <P>I am especially pleased that the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, and his party have performed a somersault on this proposal. I am disappointed they are not present because it is a reflection of the party which is strong on preaching to us on standards in public office but, when it comes to the practicalities of doing something about it, none of them is present to debate the legislation.</P>
      <P>In referring to that somersault by Deputy Quinn on this legislation, I have in mind the revelations at the tribunals about the leader's account and an interview I gave on this topic to the RTE 9 o'clock news on 7 October 1999 having spoken at a tribunal earlier on the leader's account. I said I was convinced there was a need for a change in the legislation governing the leader's account and that the sooner the Oireachtas introduced it, the better. I said I would like to see legislation whereby the leader's account would be paid into a dedicated bank account and would not be mixed with funds from other sources and whereby there would be an independent audit each year and the accounts would be published and laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>On the same news bulletin, the same RTE reporter asked the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, if in light of the revelations at the tribunals the legislation governing the leader's account needed further reform. His response was: &ldquo;I think it's tight enough at the present time&rdquo;. That was subsequent to the revelations at the tribunals and he did not agree with my call on the same news bulletin for an audit of the leader's account. I welcome the somersault by Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party in supporting the legislation brought forward by the Government. One wonders why he had such an attitude to a simple and straightforward suggestion which was gaining currency at the time. It is something the Labour Party will be asked to address before too long.</P>
      <P>It is a somersault of monumental proportions and is another example of the Labour Party preaching to the rest of us but not always acting in the best interests of the electoral system. We witnessed it last week with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which the Labour Party opposed even though it outlawed large donations, be they from the corporate, trade union or private sectors. The party's members preached to us every day about the need for such legislation but when it was introduced they opposed it on Second Stage, they will oppose it on Committee Stage and, in all probability, they will oppose it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> We witnessed a further example this evening of the double think of parties of what they like to call the left when Deputy Joe Higgins complained about the legislation. He said he was opposed to this legislation because he could not make large donations to his party as it would be outlawed. He had the audacity to suggest there should be special provision in the legislation for TDs to make donations to their parties above the statutory limit which applies to all other individuals. I have never heard such an outlandish comment from the left. He suggested that legislation on donations should be passed with a special exemption for TDs. I reject that concept. The same rules should apply to us as apply to every individual.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party opposed this legislation when it was put to the test. It also complained about the expenditure limits. They are the same for every party and if the Labour Party runs more candidates, it can spend more money. If it runs candidates in every constituency, it can spend the same amount of money as us and if it runs more, it is legally entitled to spend more. The Labour Party seems to think this type of legislation is a plot by the large parties to spend large amounts of money. The same rules apply to Labour and it can spend the same amount of money as us if it chooses to run candidates in every constituency. The fact that it chooses not to do so is a matter for it.</P>
    <P>This legislation, which introduces the statutory audit of the leader's account, is part of a package of legislation brought forward by the Government. We are not just making law but making history because this is something which has never been done since the foundation of the State. The legislation bans large donations and introduces strict expenditure limits for the next general election and statutory audits on the leader's account. These are what the public has complained about and we are addressing them by debating the legislation which will stand the test of time. The people will say in future that, when confronted with difficulties in the political system, we introduced and passed the legislation and ensured it operated. I compliment the Minister for introducing the legislation and look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation. As a result of revelations from the tribunals, a long-standing system was brought to a sudden halt. I remember the interview to which Deputy Fleming referred. Were it not for the revelations at the tribunal, he would not have said what he did. It was because of what was revealed in Mr. Haughey's case that a convention to which all party leaders had subscribed since 1938 was put in a whirlwind in that anything that had been done before could not be trusted. It is important for the public to understand about the leaders' allowance. People outside of this House genuinely believe the leaders' allowance is for the sole personal purpose of the leader of the party, which is <Col N="112" /> entirely wrong. Political parties, whether in Government or Opposition, could not live up to their responsibilities if there was not some type of State funding. I have always believed the Exchequer should fund elections because I totally oppose corporate donations. They were necessary up to a point but if people want the sort of transparency they tell me they want, we should adopt the continental system. If we had that system, including the famous polls we now have every second day, taxpayers would not be willing to fund it. There is a price tag on democracy and political parties must be able to sell their manifestos leading up to general elections. The lifeblood of democracy is that people should be aware of what the political parties will do when they get into Government, therefore, there is an onus on the Exchequer to fund that system. My view on that issue might not be the majority view but I guarantee it will not be too many years before we reach that point. If there is a cap on corporate donations, a way will be found round that issue. While capping corporate donations is a huge step for the Government, only time will tell whether it will work.</P>
      <P>I agree with the provision for a public audit of the leaders' account. I compliment the Minister on this proposal which, in the circumstances, is the only thing that can be done. It is the only point of view one could take following the disclosures of the recent tribunals. I am not aware of the details of the leaders' accounts but I know what they must be used for. I assume there will be sufficient flexibility to operate entirely above board in regard to politics, political parties, messages and so on.</P>
      <P>I note that the leaders' allowance cannot be used for election purposes. Many people would have an open view on this aspect because electioneering is very expensive. As Deputy McGrath mentioned earlier, it is difficult to get sufficient funding to get one's message across at constituency level. Despite what Deputy Fleming said in regard to the controls in place, many constituencies find it exceedingly difficult to reach the limit set down. I am aware of nine or ten constituencies that would not reach the target, which further re-enforces my view that the Exchequer should carry more of the can in future. In fairness to the Government, and successive Governments, the amount of Exchequer funding will increase as the years go by. If there is control at the top, there will not be as great a financial burden on constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This parliament has a long way to go before it operates as a parliament should. There have been great strides in the past 20 years and, in fairness, the committee system works relatively well. The level of debate has been excellent on occasions in the committees on which I sit but the problem is that in general the public is not aware of committees sitting, unless something extremely sensational is happening. A huge amount of good work is done in committees which occupy several hours of our day, sometimes several days a week. <Col N="113" /> The problem is that no one knows these meetings are taking place. It is very important that the electorate should be aware of the work we are doing. If the committee system is to become an integral part of this House, which I hope will be the case in the future, we will have to give greater priority to the type of exposure this House gets &ndash; it is not getting a great deal of exposure this evening. The public would be very interested in some of the topics I have heard discussed at committee level but the opportunity did not arise.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work needs to be done in this House to ensure Bills get the type of scrutiny necessary. Deputy Mitchell has spent a lifetime on this aspect. On the nod, we agree to expenditure amounting to £100 million or £200 million. This has been the case under every Government. The system must be tightened up, therefore, there must be much better research facilities. There are a number of reasons parties should be given this type of back-up. I was Minister of State for almost five years and I have been a member of the front bench on many occasions in various capacities. What Deputy McGrath said is true. When one faces a Minister and his civil servants one is at a great disadvantage, even though that is not their intention. Anyone who has been in a Department is aware of the disadvantages. Most of the time one does not have any assistance. In fairness to Mr. Haughey in the early 1980s, it was a huge step forward when each Member got a secretary. I recall the newspapers commenting on it at the time and one would think we were made up for life and that we should not have got the facility. As everyone knows, that was very important and we now need to take the next step.</P>
    <P>In so far as the question of research is concerned, we are blessed with very bright young graduates. Numerically speaking, many of them would not be engaged in this House but it would be another outlet for their talents. More importantly, that they were trained and went through the system in the Oireachtas, would mean a great number of people would know how the system of government worked, including the Opposition and Government side. We are lucky to have such people in our midst and this would be money well spent. We have debated this issue for a long time but we are not making much progress. In fairness to the Minister, he has made the role of TDs much better than it was when he took office. That is how it should be because there has been a dramatic change in the way we operate inside and outside the House in the past five to six years. Everybody wants an answer immediately. A few years ago, one could hang on for a week, but one cannot wait an hour now.</P>

      <P>That is the point. All one has to do to become educated on certain topics is to turn up at the local hall. One will be educated very quickly on such occasions.</P>
      <P>Help and assistance should be provided to Front Bench spokespersons, regardless of who is in Opposition. This is not a political matter. I do not know when it will happen but changes occur and parties cross the floor of the House. In my view, anybody who is doing a reasonable job as a Front Bench spokesperson on behalf of their party is entitled to the type of back up service that was mentioned earlier. There is nothing wrong with the proposal made by Deputy McGrath; I made a similar proposal many times over the years.</P>
      <P>In fairness to those involved, I had no problem with the Civil Service in any Department I shadowed or in which I worked. Regardless of who is in Government, one is given information of a certain type. I have been around long enough to know that one will not be told about policy matters and that one should not look for them. However, there is no reason somebody from, for example, the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or the Marine and Natural Resources should not be seconded to assist a Front Bench Opposition spokesperson in a number of areas. I appreciate one will not be told what the Minister intends to do next or about strategic policy matters. However, the person could assist with mundane matters, such as information about who to contact in the Department. This type of information is vital, particularly with regard to the Estimates.</P>
      <P>A little more information is contained in the Estimates now, but I remember some dreadful instances years ago where huge sums were allocated to a Department but one did not know whether it related to oil wells or a satellite in the sky. It could have been anything. The position has improved a little and the committees are able to consider them in more detail. However, personnel from Departments would be a huge help in that regard. There is nothing wrong with this suggestion. I do not understand how it could cause any embarrassment to anybody on any side. I appreciate that policy matters and strategy will not be given to the Opposition, but there is an array that information that could be provided. This information is available to the public; it is only a matter of somebody getting it quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> Reference was made earlier to Private Members' time. When the Minister was in Opposition Private Members' motions were timely and of great public interest &ndash; they would not have been tabled if that had not been the case. It might not have been a subject that was favourable to the Government, but that is politics. However, something is obviously wrong with the system if a debate cannot be extended beyond 90 minutes when there is public interest in a matter and a score of Deputies want to contribute to a debate on it. Deputies want to discuss it and the public want to listen to the debate, but it is curtailed. Not many people will be watching this debate on television, but everybody wants to contribute to certain debates, for example, on health issues. This aspect must be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>In the context of time restraints, guillotines are not a good idea because all 166 representatives have their own agendas. I heard filibustering over three or four hours in the House in the past and I do not agree with such tactics. However, the system has become too restrictive and many of our colleagues feel they do not have an opportunity to discuss matters as they were elected to do. The other problem is that they do not get the exposure on the committees they thought they would get or that they should receive. Unless we come to grips with this issue, there will be many disgruntled Deputies and the electorate will not like what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in so far as it goes, is welcome. One hopes that, in the future, the type of refinements I mentioned will be implemented because, ultimately, they will lead to the better democracy for which we all hope.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. Deputy Connaughton said democracy is not cheap. We saw today when a leader was brought before the courts that democracy did not work in another part of Europe. There is supposed to be democracy in another part of this country, but there are regular knee cappings there. Democracy is not cheap but it is still the best way of ensuring people are represented. I am not aware of any other system that has worked as well. The people have an opportunity to change the Government every four or five years. This Administration has been in office for over four years but the interview board will have an opportunity in the next few months to decide who they want as Taoiseach, as Ministers and as Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I recall meeting Deputy Connaughton when I entered the House in 1994. He gave me a wise piece of advice coming in the door &ndash; it does not really matter in what part of the House one sits as long as one has a seat in it. He was right; it was good advice.</P>

      <P>I recall coming down the steps into the House and meeting the then Ceann Comhairle. The then Chief Whip introduced me to him and I sat down. The Ceann Comhairle wished me well, but nobody told me where the toilet was located. Nobody told me what I should do in the House or where I should go. I was the loneliest man in the House that day and I wondered if I was up to the job or if anybody was there to assist me.</P>

      <P>I remember leaving my office in the west where I was a small auctioneer with a photocopier, a fax machine and a modern telephone system. When I arrived in the House, I had an office that I shared with somebody else and a telephone, but no fax machine or photocopier. Although I do not always agree with the Minister, he is like me in that he says what he thinks. It sometimes gets him into trouble, as it does me, but I do not mind because the people elected us to speak on their behalf. However, I thank the Minister for changing the circumstances I mentioned. Members now have their own offices with a fax machine and a modern telephone system. There are also more photocopiers. Matters have improved.</P>
      <P>I arrived early in Leinster House today because I had deputations and committee meetings. I have not opened my post yet because I have been dealing with telephone calls, committee business and political problems I encountered in my clinics yesterday. I was at a clinic yesterday at 8.50 a.m. and I left it at 3.40 p.m. I went to a public meeting in Knock and I attended a political meeting last night. I started doing other work late last night before heading for Dublin in the middle of the night. I do not have secretarial assistance when my secretary is sick or on annual leave. Legislation comes before this House on a daily or even an hourly basis but it is brought in for the benefit of big business and not of people like ourselves who work one to one.</P>
      <P>Democracy must be funded and the correct decision has been made in that regard. Funding for political parties should be audited and it is right to put an end to donations of £50,000 and £100,000 to political parties. Donations of that size are merely corruption under another name. I do not like them and I have not ever liked them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fought three general elections and won two. During the 1997 general election my supporters' greatest complaint was that my colleagues, both in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, had vans, jeeps and all sorts of vehicles travelling throughout the constituency. I remember going to a first round Con<Col N="117" /> nacht championship match in Galway and seeing the road postered from Westport to Tuam and vans from all political parties. My supporters came home devastated.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance can be criticised on political and policy issues but he has done a good job in relation to this House and I compliment him on that.</P>
      <P>The time has come for party leaders, particularly the leaders of Opposition parties, to be given the resources they need. If a public representative attends a local public meeting he will find the manager of Leader or other community organisations with a team of secretaries, paid for by the State, while the TD, with no such help, is expected to be an expert on all legislation going through the Oireachtas. He might have spent the day meeting deputations without an opportunity to familiarise himself with the legislation being debated in the Houses, while his secretary is overworked and unable to cope with the volume of work presented to her.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a reasonable person. He knows the day has gone when a query could be noted on the back of a cigarette packet and dealt with a month later.</P>

      <P>A constituent came to me yesterday with a query and then telephoned me early this morning, before any office was open, to know if I had a reply. This is the level of service now demanded by the public. People want instant information and instant action. If we are to cope with such demands we need extra resources. Many community groups have better facilities and staff than public representatives, yet we are expected to be experts on all legislation and to be present everywhere.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance. Many members of my party were afraid of criticism from the public. The Minister has no such fear. I hope his actions will not damage him politically</P>

      <P>We must bring the business of the Dáil back to the House. Too much of the business of the House is dealt with on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and elsewhere in the media. It is being presented to the media by spin doctors behind the backs of the Members. All announcements, Bills and Ministers' statements should be presented first in <Col N="118" /> this House. If a Minister announces a matter outside the House he should be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We have been elected to this House, which is the national parliament and the people have respect for this House. We have not shown the same respect for it and we are now paying the price for that lack of respect. Announcements are made on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, then discussed by Pat Kenny on his radio programme and perhaps brought to the Dáil a month later when they are old news and no longer important.</P>
      <P>All announcements should be made in this House and parliamentary questions should be answered. What we have now is not Question Time, it is merely protection for the Minister. The current rules mean Deputies cannot get an answer because the Minister can filibuster for one minute and avoid giving an answer.</P>
      <P>If the public are to provide resources for political parties, we must respect the people who elect us and this House. If we do not have respect for one another we cannot expect the public to respect us. We must bring back the power, the respect and the business to this House.</P>

      <P>Previous speakers have referred to the importance of research to Deputies. Many Deputies are forced to rely on American interns for our research. While these interns are highly qualified they cannot meet the demands placed on Deputies when dealing with complicated legislation.</P>
      <P>At any one time a great number of Bills are before the House. Deputy Jim Mitchell, as convenor of the finance group, had to deal with eight Bills in recent weeks.</P>

      <P>This was without any back-up service. While he dealt with the tasks very well, he would be the first to accept that he would have done so more effectively if he had had adequate support. This Dáil is now in its final year and so, this Bill provides a mechanism for future generations of Deputies. I hope those future generations recognise the Minister for Finance as the person who put these provisions in place. I also hope the Minister's officials provide us with adequate research back-up services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on Second Stage the Minister referred to the validation of leaders' allowances. Deputy Fleming referred to the same question this evening. All allowances should be <Col N="119" /> properly validated and audited. The recipients of public money must be held responsible for it. In the past money was used for the wrong reasons and without any great benefit to the taxpayer. We are evaluated by the people and we are held accountable to the electorate at every election. The people who work as researchers and in other back-up services and the civil servants should all be in a system of evaluation to ensure they are giving value for taxpayers' money. I welcome that proposal where the party leader will be required to prepare a statement of his or her expenditure and have it audited by a public auditor and not an employee of any State institution.</P>
    <P>Overall the facilities in this House leave a lot to be desired. We are now only catching up with other national parliaments. I have a background in physical education and I have said before that a gymnasium is needed in Leinster House. If people were fitter, they would have more endurance, they would work better and they would be more productive. There is also the possibility that they would last longer in politics; they would certainly live longer. The corporate sector is responding to this challenge. Most big companies have personal trainers available to their employees. Senior executives use gymnasia on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Of all the occupations and professions, politicians are under the most stress. We are at the mercy of the people and that is the strength of democracy. We must apply to retain our jobs every four years or less. It is a very stressful occupation and we do not have the facilities here to ensure that we do that job better. We are provided with research and secretarial resources and we are properly paid but it is very important that our health is also protected. I am pleased that there is provision for a gymnasium but I note that it is now on the long finger until next April. Unfortunately many people in this House will not benefit from it but I hope future generations of TDs will benefit. I hope to address other issues tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and I will make my Second Stage reply now. If Deputies wish to pick up on any specific points again, I will be able to deal with them on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At some stage I told Deputy Jim Mitchell that to minimise future confusion the Parliamentary Counsel thought it best to take the old subsection or section which was to be grafted on and to rewrite it entirely, repeating verbatim provisions which were in the 1996 or 1998 Acts which are not actually being changed. I wish to point out to Deputy Deenihan that I also am confused with the names. The names of the Bills today and tomorrow are the reverse of what you thought they would be. The Bill I am dealing with now, which is known as the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill, I <Col N="120" /> referred to as the Audit of Party Leaders' Allowance Bill and that is what it was known as. When the Bill came back from the Parliamentary Counsel, it had changed into this name, whereas the name of the Bill to be taken tomorrow, which I call the TDs Bill, is a name I cannot recall at the moment. It is all very confusing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We should change it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These things are legal and that is why there are these particular names. Apparently, the Title of the Bill must encompass the purpose of the Bill. This Bill will be the Audit of the Leader's Allowance Bill so I do not blame Deputy Deenihan for being confused because even I cannot now remember the names of the two Bills at all. I used to refer to one as the Audit of the Leader's Allowance Bill and the other as the TDs Bill.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to back-up facilities and the lack of secretarial assistance. I take this opportunity of making a contribution on this topic. Deputy Rabbitte made a particular point today on the Order of Business when he asked the Taoiseach a particular question about whether this was going to be the subject of a consultancy study. I wish to clarify this point. I have pretty clear views on what Deputies, and in particular Opposition front benchers, require in order to function with full effectiveness and carry out their duties to this House. From informal discussions with my fellow Members, I know that my analysis is not miles away from theirs. It is certainly tempting for me to identify the change and give fellow parliamentarians what they need and deserve in terms of secretarial back-up.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, the Government and the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of this House and of the Seanad decided as a preliminary step to introduce new arrangements for financing and resourcing the Houses of the Oireachtas, to have consultants carry out a base line study of the staffing needed by the Houses and very explicitly specified that it also deal with the non-civil service staffing resources needed by Deputies and Senators. The consultants have been recently selected and that exercise is about to commence. One thing that has been brought home to me very vividly since I took this job is that consultants have very few inhibitions in charging for what they were signed on to do and I do not think it makes sense for me to introduce major changes just as those studies begin.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was also asked on the Order of Business today about the Oireachtas Commission Bill, proposed by Deputy Jim Mitchell as Chairman of the PAC. The Heads of that Bill were brought to Cabinet to be sent to the Parliamentary Counsel. The Government decision authorised us to enter into discussion with the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad because many of the changes relate to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As proposed by Deputy Jim Mitchell, there will be a Houses of the Oireachtas Vote which will be <Col N="121" /> administered by the commission. It is intended that the commission will be made up largely of parliamentarians with the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad and some other people. The Clerk of the Dáil will be designated the Secretary General of the commission and the commission will run the Houses of the Oireachtas. A sum of money will be voted to the commission and it will be responsible for everything in the Houses of the Oireachtas. In order to begin with a proper amount of money it necessitates a proper study. When the results of the study are available in some months time and we know what extra resources, particularly in terms of staff, are needed, I will then form a view after consultation with party leaders and Opposition spokespersons as to the amount of money that will be given to the commission. It is proposed that there will be a personal representative of the Minister for Finance, possibly a Minister of State or the Minister himself, on the body. Only certain functions will be reserved to the Minister for Finance. The body will have to make the decisions.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to give the body enough money at the start and that will not be reviewed for about three to five years. There will be no more interference than that from the Department of Finance. It will be up to the commission to allocate money to front benchers, for example. I expect that TDs will have at least one extra assistant, a research assistant or whatever they wish. I was very tempted in this Bill to give front bench spokespersons an allowance or to give them a person. I decided that the best way was to leave it all with the commission. I will enter into discussions with the Opposition before the Bill is finalised.</P>
    <P>The big secret is what amount of money will be given to this body at the start and its plan for the future. We will get away from the nonsense that every time the Estimates are published a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has to seek my approval for extra money for typewriters and computers. This involved rows with the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Houses of the Oireachtas blame the Department of Finance. The Department is asked if it has anything to say and it all comes before me. I have responded generously to those issues. All of this will be gone. There will be none of this reporting, fighting and arguing. The commission will run the whole business. To respond to a point made by Deputy Rabbitte, that is what the consultants recommended&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not sure what the work load of the Dáil is for the latter months of the year but it is my intention to have this as quickly as the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government can do it. In recent weeks the Parliamentary Council has been active on my behalf and I hope can be as active in the autumn. The commission will be set up more or less on the underlying principles which Deputy Mitchell outlined in his report. We will discuss any necessary changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a budget will last for at least three years. An annual budget would bring it under the control of the Estimates process. This is what Deputy Mitchell did not want in his Committee of Public Accounts inquiry. I agree with him. If it was subject to the Estimates process every year it would mean debates and cutbacks and so on. I will not have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be the estimate plus the rate of inflation every year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever it will be it will be at least for three years or, maybe, five years and perhaps in the interim we will have to add to it. We will not have it as part of the annual Estimates process because that would bring mean fighting about it every year. We will start off with a high figure and it will be that figure plus inflation, for three years. The figure will be worked out at the start. If anything extra turns up in the interim, that we have not thought about, the sum should be large enough to accommodate it. All the fighting the poor Minister for Finance had to endure about staffing and people making representations to him will be moved to the commissions which will be made up mostly of Oireachtas members. It will be a far different process and they will have to make some touch decisions. I am sure they will not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; all the time. I am just getting rid of the problem and giving it to somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derek McDowell raised that and other matters relating to the resourcing of parliamentarians and in that context mentioned the Library. Almost 30 years ago a decision was taken to recruit graduate staff to the library whose duties included carrying out research for Members. These have been used over the years particularly where briefing for inter-parliamentary group meetings were concerned but spokespersons and individual Members who are likely to be engaged in hard-fought parliamentary battles prefer to draw for research, on party employees, lobby for <Col N="123" /> support, or buy it in rather than use a House resource which is equally available to their rivals. This, I expect, is an issue that will be dealt with in one stand or another in the consultancy exercise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton and others made the case that a civil servant could be seconded to front a spokesperson. If they think about it they might consider that that is not a very good idea. Civil servants are non-political and are there to serve all parties. If one civil servant worked for Opposition spokespersons the danger would be that he or she would become identified with that party and that may not be for the betterment of the civil servant's career. It would not be a particularly good idea to go down that road.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made the point here and at other times that TDs will need a compliance officer going around. Deputy Mitchell and I have been Members of the House for the same length of time. Certainly I do not have records going back 24 years. They are in files, somewhere if someone could actually find them. The great advantage of moving house given the amount of stuff we gather over the years &ndash; we live in a very small house &ndash; is that somebody on my behalf, probably my wife, made a policy decision to burn everything, good and bad. I do not know why people keep stuff because 99% of it will not ever be required again. I found the most amazing things, all kinds of objects and so on but she took the great decision to keep burning. It was probably the best thing to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell said the Bill might be lacking in teeth. The real sanction is twofold. Public criticism by the commission which will now be seized upon by political opponents and by the media which may reduce the saleability of the Leader of the party and the cold reality of having the allowance stopped will certainly concentrate minds. Parties usually have a need for money and a leader who abandons even temporarily, a reliable source, is unlikely to be popular with his parliamentary colleagues.</P>
    <P>I considered the whole question about the allowance to Independents before the Bill was drafted. I come from the starting position, more or less like McEntee in 1938 that this money is primarily for party leaders and that they should decide what to do with it. The least possible interference should be in the Bill. As Deputy Mitchell said time has moved on and unfortunately we do not live in that kind of environment where people were trusted entirely. I do not want to insert into the Bill&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are also into serious money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the difference. We are dealing with substantial amounts of money for the Fianna Fáil Party, Fine Gael, Labour and the other parties. The figures have been mentioned by some Deputies. For the two major parties it amounts to more than £1.5 million. For the <Col N="124" /> Labour Party it is more than £800,000 and fairly substantial increases are provided for. The average amount for an Independent Deputy is £22,000. I realise Deputies Mitchell and McGrath are tabling an amendment but I do not honestly believe I will impose an audit requirement for that amount of money on an individual backbench Deputy. There is a big difference between £22,000 and £1.5 million annually. I concluded it was not worthwhile. Coming from my starting point I would prefer as McEntee said in 1938 that it would be up to the party leaders to decide where that money is to be spent and it should not be influenced by any other considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought it was a virtual certainty that if £22,000 is paid to some people on these benches in the next few months that some of that money will be used for electoral purposes. The rest of us who are members of parties do not have that facility. If one is an Independent Deputy it is likely that one's priority at this moment is to get re-elected and that £22,000 is almost certain to go, at least in part, to that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some logic to what the Deputy has said. It is a bit like expenses given to Deputies and civil servants which are to be used for total reimbursement, for instance. It is hard to draw the dividing line. On the whole question of minimum allowances to Independents and whether they should be provided, the clear advice to both Deputy Quinn, my predecessor, and I is that it is very important there be equilibrium between all parties and the Independents. There is a skewing of the allowances in favour of the smaller parties and the Independents, but to get over the legal question, every Member elected to this House is entitled to the same&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is hoping he will, very shortly, whenever we face the people. Deputy Joe Higgins complained that his party is restricted in the amount it could receive from him. I suspect what he had in mind was restrictions on political donations under the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. The Bill before the House is concerned with payments necessitated by parliamentary non-electoral purposes. It is not a matter of choice, as Deputy Higgins suggested, about whom it relates to. It must be used for the purpose for which it was given. The only way it can be given to a party outside this House is in payment for services or research which they may be in a position to supply and which are seen by the commission as a genuine sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked at the question of auditing the Independents but concluded against going down that road. Every one person party in the House is working on the basis that they &ndash; Deputy Higgins and Deputy Ó Caoláin anyhow &ndash; will <Col N="125" /> come back with many companions after the next election. We are respecting their ambitions and taking them seriously. Deputy Higgins, as leader of his party, will have to supply audits. He was worried about what money he can give to his party and so on. He may not be aware that, as a result of a row in 1998 about the increases, I promised in this House that I would oblige him at the next election. There is a provision in tomorrow's Bill that the Deputy can refuse an increase specially designed to accommodate the consciences of Deputies who feel they should not take increases from Buckleys or Gleesons or whoever it may be. That is to oblige people like Deputy Higgins who kicked up a row in the past about salary increases for Oireachtas Members. I specifically included this provision in the Bill before the House tomorrow morning, which will be taken by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, as I will not not available then. Accordingly, Deputy Higgins will not have to worry about these matters in future. If he does not feel like taking the money, he does not have to. I do not consider it worthwhile having a full blown audit for a small amount of money, although I could have gone down that road.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell suggested that each Deputy would almost need his or her own compliance officer. I accept there are additional impositions but I hope the way the commission will operate will allow greater resources to Deputies. My intention is that we will have a Parliament in which Deputies are reasonably well paid, have good facilities and plenty of back-up services and will not have to take an apologetic cap-in-hand approach. In the business or professional sector, including accountants, doctors and solicitors, I have yet to see people going to the cheapest practitioner in the locality. If we devalue ourselves, people will think less of us.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned, in an interesting aside &ndash; I cannot tell him where I learned of this &ndash; that, soon after his election, he went to a meeting of his European group and met a Swedish colleague who produced books and pamphlets which he had written. That is not unusual. Keith Joseph would be regarded by many as the guru of Thatcherism, if there is such a concept. It is customary that a new Minister in a Department is briefed by the Secretary General on various matters, given an organisation chart of the Department and generally brought up to date on current issues. When Keith Joseph became a Minister &ndash; and I have this on the highest authority of somebody who served with him &ndash; he completely reversed the process by handing his books to the Secretary General, saying &ldquo;Read those over the weekend and you will understand what I am about&rdquo;. Perhaps, when we have our new system in place here, our parliamentarians, when they go abroad or become Ministers, will be in a position to do likewise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. <i>a</i>1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 43 to 48 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11)(f2&gt;a) As soon as may be, but not later than 120 days, after the end of the financial year in which an annual allowance has been paid under this section to either&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann referred to in subsection (3), or</P>
      <P>(ii)a parliamentary leader of a qualifying party,</P>
      <P>he or she shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a statement of any expenditure from that allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed the Minister has indicated in his reply to Second Stage, that he is not accepting the proposal that the £22,000 proposed to be paid to each Independent Member of this House and the £12,500 to Independent Members of the Seanad, should be subject to audit. This is a tax free allowance. A sum of £22,000, tax free, is the equivalent of about £40,000 before tax. There are seven Independent Members in this House, for whom the allowance amounts to £154,000. The corresponding figure for the other House is £60,000. The combined total comes to over £200,000 tax free, or a pre-tax equivalent of over £400,000 going, unaudited, into the pockets of Independents without any accountability whatsoever.</P>
      <P>This is the stuff of which scandals are made. Leaders of parties are, quite properly, required to submit an audited account of their expenditure, which will be open to scrutiny by the Public Offices Commission, but not so for Independents. I am proposing that we change that and it is my intention to press this amendment so that Independent Members who get this £22,000 tax free will have to be accountable for it in the same way as Leaders of parties. No other Member of this House will have £1,000 to spend personally. The Minister is wrong in his approach to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted, there will be two or three minor consequential amendments. In subsection (11)(<i>e</i>)(ii), after the words &ldquo;parliamentary leader&rdquo;, we would also have to insert &ldquo;, or the Deputy or Senator, as the case may be&rdquo;. In subsection (11)(<i>f</i>), we would have to delete the phrase &ldquo;a parliamentary leader&rdquo; and, in subsection (12)(<i>a</i>), to delete the words &ldquo;to a parliamentary leader&rdquo;. I urge the Minister to accept this <Col N="127" /> amendment. I do so, not only as spokesman for my party on Finance but also as one who has been chairman of the Public Accounts Committee twice. It is wrong that moneys of the order involved in this regard should be completely unaccounted for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel strongly that an outrageous &ldquo;Smartie&rdquo; is being thrown to a few individual Members of this House. In reality, of course, there are very few, if any, Independent Members of the House. Nobody on the benches behind me decides, on a day-to-day basis, whether they will support a particular Bill or motion on the basis of what it actually represents. There are four Independents who are bought by the Government and have stayed bought from day one. There are a number of Opposition Independents, broadly defined, who always vote against the Government. None of them decides, on the basis of what a motion is about, or the content of a piece of legislation, whether they will vote for or against it. The word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; is not appropriate in the first place. It just defies belief for the Minister to suggest that a figure of £22,000 per individual is so trivial that we should not bother about it. Let us posit the most extreme possibility. Let us allow our imagination&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister deliberately decide to exempt certain chosen individuals from the audit? If we are introducing an audit which is good enough for the parties, it should be good enough for everybody receiving this public money. I have not heard any argument from the Minister to suggest that there is any good reason from exempting any Member from this particular audit.</P>

      <P>Are Deputies suggesting that all the expenses we give to individual Deputies from the public purse for travel and subsistence, constituency allowances and secretarial allowances should also be audited?

      <P>This is a specific allowance which is being made available to parties and we are also giving it to individuals for reasons defined in the legislation. Most Members are being treated differently from those few. The Minister should either apply one rule to everybody or to nobody. The Minister is applying a totally different rule to some individuals who sit on the back benches. Let us allow ourselves a flight of fancy and assume there are some Inde<Col N="128" /> pendent Deputies who might conceivably not spend a single penny of the allowance for the subheads prescribed in the Bill, and pocket it as salary. That is the equivalent of about £35,000 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The original purpose of the Bill was the audit of the leaders' allowances. Section 1 refers to payment of annual allowances to parliamentary leaders of qualifying parties. The idea of having an audit arose from events at the tribunal relating to a party leader and the accusation that the money given to the party leader for parliamentary purposes was spent on activities for which it was not meant. I am not making any judgment as to whether that is right or wrong, but arising from that it was decided to have an audit of party leaders' allowances.</P>
      <P>We did not have such an audit since the allowance was introduced in 1938. By stealth the principles outlined in 1938 were the correct ones, and I would prefer not to have to introduce this legislation &ndash; my view is that party leaders should decide themselves what to do with their money; everybody knows what they were supposed to do with it. Due to the climate which has ensued arising from certain items which came out at the tribunals we have gone down this road. It is for party leaders of qualifying political parties. An Independent <i>per se</i> is an Independent not attaching to any party, but due to constitutional reasons and the need to have equilibrium between all Members of the House, in recent years we have been forced to make sure all Deputies are treated equally so we do not run foul of the Constitution, and that is what I am trying to do.</P>
      <P>I did not start the principle of giving money to Independent Deputies. This was started by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance. Until then no money was given to Independent Deputies. Deputy Quinn decided, for the same legal reasons that arose following the McKenna judgment, that there would be difficulties, and the figure began at an average of £10,000. Now, due to an increase in the allowances, the average figure is £22,000. I did not start giving allowances to individual Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely reject the Minister's stance on this. He talks about Deputies being treated equally, but we are not treated equally. The seven Independent Deputies can pocket the money, invest it, drink it or do what they like with it. They can buy posters and leaflets and rent offices in their constituencies, which none of the rest of us can do. Parliamentary leaders' allowances are to help in the performance of parliamentary business. We all know the seven Independent Deputies &ndash; Deputy Joe Higgins is not an Independent Deputy &ndash; play virtually no role in shadowing legislation. They are never at committee meetings or in the House late at night. They are in their constituencies where we cannot be because we are here doing our job; if the bells ring we have to be here for a vote.</P>
      <P>The more I hear about this and the Referendum Commission the more I believe the Constitution needs very radical amendment.</P>

      <P>The point is that we are now extending the requirement for audit of parliamentary leaders' allowance, and rightly so, but we are not treating Independent Deputies equally as they will not have to have their allowances audited. It is certainly not fair and I question whether it is constitutional. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. Why should Deputy Gildea, Deputy Gregory and Deputy Fox be paid the equivalent of a Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or Deputy Lowry. These matters were considered by Deputy Quinn when he introduced this in 1996. Until then the leaders' allowance was just given to leaders. Deputy Quinn decided on a new basis for giving the leaders' allowance by linking it to the parliamentary strength of each party. It was a fairly rational way of doing it. He further decided, for legal and constitutional reasons, that Independent Deputies should also receive the allowance. It <Col N="130" /> comes under the heading of the parliamentary leaders' allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big difference between giving £1.5 million to the two major parties, the best part of £1 million to the Labour Party and having an audit requirement, and saying there has to be an audit requirement for the £22,000 given to the Independents. I do not think an audit is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all about equality of treatment. The Minister is right in saying Deputy Quinn made that provision and was advised that provision had also to be made for Independent Deputies, advice he accepted for reasons we all know and appreciate. However, that is not what we are talking about. We accept that an allowance has to be given for research and parliamentary purposes to Independent Deputies. What I and Deputy Mitchell do not accept is that they should be entitled to take this money and not account for it in any way. There is no guarantee that Deputy Lowry, Deputy Gregory or any of the other Deputies do not also like Charvet shirts, and they might equally be inclined to spend the money in the way the former leader of the Minister's party did. The Minister has not given us an explanation and I cannot understand why he does not want to treat the seven Independent Deputies in the same way as every other Deputy will be treated.</P>

I sent all the material to them, asked them what they wanted and gave them all sorts of advice. The parties, including Sinn Féin, Deputy Higgins's party, the Labour Party, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, sent back their expert opinions. I have correspondence on this, and nobody raised this question until now. In that six months, with all the toing and froing, including more recently, this is the first occasion that anybody has raised this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise the IDA report 2000. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, but I wish the Tánaiste was here because she is very familiar with the scene in Donegal and very sympathetic to it. I would have liked her to have heard my impressions of the current report. &ldquo;Simply counting job numbers is no longer the best measure of success in the economy, as Ireland moves into a new era of development. That was fine when unemployment was the key issue&rdquo;, so began the chairman of IDA Ireland, Mr. John Dunne, at the launch of the IDA annual report for 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is still a key issue in my constituency even though the IDA does not seem to know. Simply counting jobs is a fairly easy task in my peninsula, particularly those jobs lost to females. Some in Donegal say that it is those jobs lost that are the best measure of success in the economy of my region as Ireland moves into a new era of development. Mr. Dunne went on to say: &ldquo;the value of a job to the economy, the skills and knowledge levels required to operate that job, the regional location of the job as well as the levels of innovation and research and development in companies are all important measures from now on.&rdquo; He stated &ldquo;from now on&rdquo;, but each year I hear of the new strategy and the new <Col N="133" /> focus that is being given to the regional locations, to the black spots, to the Border and Objective One regions. This week even Wexford was included.</P>
    <P>In 2000 when we counted the numbers in the north west Donegal area, we saw reduced numbers employed through IDA companies from 5,486 to 5,390. What was worse was that this was not even a blip on a healthy screen as the preceding year, 1998, had delivered a drop from 6,461 to 5,486. In five years, IDA Ireland has managed to reduce employment from 6,630 to 5,390 at a time when the IDA is saying it is focusing on us. I would hate to think what it would be like if it ignored us.</P>
    <P>We have the optimism of Mr. Dorgan to rely on for the incoming year as we see with the downturn in the American economy, &ldquo;it certainly would be a very different year compared with the past few years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>IDA staff are due to move into three regional economic centres to stimulate their development as magnets of growth. Yet, in spite of the difficulties experienced in Donegal, there is no plan to locate any of this one-third of IDA staff in the county. Where is the special status and focus?</P>
    <P>I concur completely with Mr. Dunne's comments that Irish people now expect not only to have jobs but to have well paid and satisfying jobs, preferably in their own region. He believes these are legitimate aspirations based on the levels of growth and development achieved in recent years and that new responses are required from development agencies such as the IDA and infrastructure and service providers.</P>
    <P>We hear on a daily basis of hundreds of jobs being created in other areas and of small numbers of job losses compared to those experienced in Donegal. Immediate replacements and remedial action are provided for job losses elsewhere. It is very difficult to reconcile this with what is happening in Donegal.</P>
    <P>The people of Inishowen are among the people to whom Mr. Dunne refers. We need jobs to be delivered in Donegal and we want to see the decentralisation of State mind-sets. State agencies must deliver real jobs to Inishowen and must put in place proper infrastructure to assist our region to make progress if only, as Mr. Dunne states, from the point of view of equity.</P>
    <P>Let us stop hearing dreadful statistics such as those outlined in the IDA's annual report of 2000. We must begin to hear fewer excuses and more positive messages for Donegal and the north-west, particularly Inishowen. I will not rehearse the litany of job losses suffered as I have done so on many occasions. Neither will I raise the slow progress made in regard to the sale of IDA land in Moville to Donegal County Council which wishes to facilitate the development of a community enterprise unit. I take this opportunity to commend Donegal County Council on its real efforts and direct actions to make job statistics in Donegal in some way decent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> The challenge remains. I trust I have proved this evening that I have kept informed of the IDA's views and I would now Iike it to react to my views. I await the IDA's 2001 report and await equity for Inishowen and Donegal north-east.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, through the enterprise development agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. A key factor in the achievement of this objective, and a primary objective of this Government, is the creation of a business environment in which job opportunities continue to flourish and, equally, in which job applicants have the requisite skills requirements. In line with commitments contained in the national development plan, the enterprise development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. The new 12.5% corporation tax rate and initiatives on matters such as education, physical infrastructure and technology under the national development plan, allow Ireland to remain competitive both in developing indigenous industry and securing inward investment projects.</P>
      <P>In an effort to ensure that the objective of balanced regional development will be achieved, IDA Ireland has, over the past 18 months radically changed its policy, under the direction of the Government, with a commitment to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. As regards the north west-Donegal region, IDA's Donegal regional office was re-established in Letterkenny. In addition, IDA is in the process of relocating a number of key operating units into the region. Engineering and consumer products, together with a section of international services, are relocating to Sligo. This move is designed to stimulate and support growth from within the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is acknowledged that the north-west Donegal region has shown some decline in IDA supported jobs in recent years, IDA considers that the area is beginning to show recovery. This recovery will be more apparent as the new projects which have been announced make their impact in the years ahead. In this regard, phase 1 of the development of Letterkenny Business Park has been completed. PacifiCare, which currently employs 180 people, now occupies Building One. The company recently announced an expansion project to create an additional 160 jobs at full development. Work is nearing completion on the provision of a second 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory at the park and planning permission has been sought for a third advance factory. Prudential Insurance Company of America has occupied a new office facility at Letterkenny Office Park and currently employs 150 persons. Prumerica has <Col N="135" /> announced an expansion of its operation which will result in the creation of an additional 450 jobs. The project will be located in a second office facility in this park.</P>
    <P>Other job expansions in the area include Kirchhoff Ireland which recently announced an expansion of its automotive components operation in Letterkenny. The company currently employs 53 people and the expansion will employ an additional 50 people at full development; Interventional Technologies &ndash; IVT &ndash; which is now owned by Boston Scientific has announced plans to create an additional 90 jobs through the expansion of its existing operation in Letterkenny; and Abbott Laboratories in Donegal town, which employs 550 people, announced plans to invest £50 million, with the support of IDA Ireland, for the development of its operation, which will secure the future of the facility.</P>
    <P>In Ballyshannon, work has commenced on the development of a business park and it is planned to provide a 20,000 sq. ft. factory on this park. Buncrana is the focus of IDA efforts on the Inishowen peninsula. Additional land has been purchased in Buncrana and planning permission has been sought for a 20,000 sq. ft. building. Work will commence shortly on the development of this site. The research facility of Claddagh Resources, formerly Network Resources, at Lisfannon, plans to create 35 new jobs, the majority for people with third level qualifications. Recruitment by the company is ongoing. The previously vacant Fruit of the Loom facility at Malin has been sold to Donegal County Council to facilitate the development of an operation by Forward Emphasis which is due to be opened later this month.</P>
    <P>Lands surplus to the needs of IDA for inward investment purposes are in the process of being sold to Donegal County Council to assist in the development of local projects with job creating potential. IDA is also marketing vacant facilities previously occupied by Fruit of the Loom at Ballymacarry and Lisfannon, Buncrana, as well as Milford and Raphoe. In addition to the above positive developments, the implementation of the Donegal employment initiative task force's recommendations has been allocated to the Donegal County Development Board. IDA's participation on the county development board involves the provision of information on inward investment and sharing with the board national-regional strategies and policy on foreign direct investment. The county development board's brief is to prepare a ten year strategy for the development of County Donegal. IDA has been invited to participate in the strategy together with many other agencies including social partners, farming interests and local councillors.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland and IDB Northern Ireland have also put in place a joint marketing programme for the north-west region which includes Counties Donegal and Derry. The initiative involves the marketing of the region by overseas executives to potential investors and some of the work to date <Col N="136" /> has included the setting up of a joint database of information. Familiarisation trips for the relevant executives in IDA and IDB have also been arranged. Other areas of co-operation are being explored, including the development of a website and a cross-Border business park.</P>
    <P>Allied to above IDA job creation initiatives, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards are actively promoting the development of indigenous enterprises and have been successful in creating good quality and enduring employment in the region. We are confident that the ongoing co-ordinated job creation efforts by the industrial development agencies in the north-west Donegal region will bring positive results to the area in the year ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by members of the management committee and support group of Gaelscoil Lios na nÓg to raise the problems they face in regard to the school's building project. I will quote from a letter they sent to me in May:</P>
      <P>The Department has approved AJ Wejcherts Architects to design this scheme. It has taken a whole frustrating year to reach this stage and this week we have heard that the Department has decided to review all projects in progress and will not be ratifying Wejcherts' proposed design team &ndash; engineers, quantity surveyors, etc. &ndash; until further notice. No time scale has been provided.</P>
      <P>This leaves the school in a very difficult situation. Long delays such as these are already putting considerable strain on the school. Growing pupil numbers, a school full to its present capacity and a very healthy waiting list for future years illustrates that the school is a very successful and much needed entity. Its future, however, will depend on our being able to provide accommodation for new classes in the short, medium and long-terms.</P>
      <P>This school has grown in a very short period of time to a position where it now has a naíonra, employs five teachers and has an enrolment of 165 students drawn from Ranelagh, Rathmines, Donnybrook, Sandymount, Crumlin and Kilmainham. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, played a significant role many years ago in saving Cullenswood House which is now the subject of renewal and renovation. The school is located beside another very famous Gaelscoil in Ranelagh, Scoil Bhríd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of problems. In the short-term they need an investigation to see if their case can be made an exception for this review. They estimate that the time scale for the design, planning and appeal would probably stretch to three years, therefore, the cost incurred in the immediate term would be nominal. That would make a case for allowing the process to advance. That is the first point. They want clearance from <Col N="137" /> the Department of Education and Science to put the design team in place.</P>
    <P>The medium-term problem is that the increase in the school population will mean that the school will have to move to a temporary site until it can accommodate everybody. The vision is to obtain permission and planning to situate prefabricated buildings on an alternative site. Two alternative sites have been located while the renovation and reconstruction of Cullenswood House are undertaken.</P>
    <P>The long-term aim is that once the architects' design team has been approved it will be necessary to have a key figure to act as shepherd during the refurbishment process. Its experience to date has been that the extremely tight cordon around the education planning office is impenetrable. Pursuing regular channels has proven ineffective and a helping hand is required.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because this is a group of dedicated parents committed to the principles and ethos of a Gaelscoil who have overcome many difficulties over a period. I have been associated with the members of this group, as has my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan. They are being frustrated by the failure, for reasons I do not fully understand but suspect, of the Department of Education and Science to engage in enabling them to proceed. They have been told there is no timetable, that they cannot, as such, move to the next stage and they are thoroughly frustrated by the impasse they have encountered.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will respond on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. I hope he will elaborate on the reason for this impasse and that we will be able to move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy has given me an Opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the provision of adequate accommodation for Gaelscoil Lios na nÓg. Mar adúirt an Teachta Quinn tá spéis mór agam i dTeach Cullenswood agus i nGaelscoil Lios na nÓg. Bhí mé amuigh ansin timpeall mí ó shin. Chas mé leis na tuismitheoirí, na múinteoirí agus leis na daltaí óga. Thug mé geallúint dóibh go ndéanfaimis ár ndícheall snas a chur ar an Teach sin taréis tamaill bhig.</P>
      <P>Gaelscoil Lios na nÓg was set up in 1996 and gained permanent recognition from the Department of Education and Science in 1998. At present the school has a staffing level of a principal and four mainstream class assistants. The school's enrolment in September 2000 was 116 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Gaelscoil is currently located in historic Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, which is in the ownership of the Office of Public Works. The Department of Education and Science has agreed to develop this building as long-term accommodation for the school and a feasibility study was carried out to establish the viability of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my Department's aim to provide suitable <Col N="138" /> long-term accommodation for the school by refurbishing Cullenswood House. A full design team will be appointed shortly to progress architectural planning for a refurbishment project at the school.</P>
    <P>While architectural planning may proceed, the Department's building unit is not in a position at this stage to provide a precise time frame for the commencement of the building work.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Department's building unit will keep the case under review. I thank him for the opportunity to outline the position concerning the accommodation needs of Gaelscoil Lios na nÓg to the House.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy Quinn to the Gaelscoil. I pledge to the House my total commitment to ensure that we can revamp Cullenswood House to provide the most up to date and adequate accommodation for a wonderful Gaelscoil in a very important area.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The decision by the Government to scupper the £1.35 billion acquisition of eight major power companies in Gdansk in Poland was wrong commercially and politically. In commercial terms this was a major coup for the ESB and Ireland. It was also a profitable coup that would have yielded rich dividends as the Polish economy continues to thrive and grow. The acquisition by the ESB of the eight major power companies in Gdansk would have given the ESB a powerful foothold of 16% of the Polish market and 2.5 million customers. The eight companies in question have an existing annual revenue of approximately £764 billion. With this strong market share and given the ESB's track record and experience, this was a market share which the ESB could only grow in time. In winning the competition for the eight companies, the ESB had successfully fought off strong competition from other European utilities, including Eon of Germany and Endesa and Iberdrola of Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB had spent millions of pounds preparing the successful bid. One can imagine the bombshell when the Irish ESB representative arrived at the Polish tenders office at 4 p.m. on Friday last only to be told that an instruction had come from the Government ordering the official <Col N="139" /> not to submit the bid and to return home. One can imagine the further embarrassment when the Polish authorities agreed to extend the tender deadline to 11 p.m. in order to enable the Irish bidders to undergo a change of heart. However, there was no change of heart at home. A Cabinet subcommittee consisting of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance had decided to block the ESB bid and literally had hung the ESB out to dry, which once again unveiled the divided thinking within Cabinet and displayed the weakness of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in terms of her being unable to defend the project to which she was supposed to be deeply committed.</P>
    <P>That decision has done irreparable damage to the ESB on the international stage. For years the company has broadened its horizons and developed commercial opportunities in many corners of the world. The Polish decision has not alone left the Poles with a major headache, it has completely undermined the credibility of the ESB in its quest for overseas markets from now on. How can the ESB muster the enthusiasm to bid for overseas contracts henceforth? Even if it decides to bid for more foreign business, how can the bid be taken seriously after the manner in which the Government sabotaged one of our longest serving and successful State utilities?</P>
    <P>The blocking of the acquisition is deeply embarrassing for Ireland on the international front coming in the wake of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on the Nice treaty, which was received very negatively in Eastern Europe. It will inevitably be perceived as a vote of no confidence by Ireland in the Polish economy. There is also the interpretation that the decision to block the deal is a clear signal of the Government's lack of confidence in the ESB management. The decision is also wrong in that there was a clear understanding between the Government and the ESB that the latter would be allowed to develop on the international market in order to compensate for its loss of domestic market share because of the opening up of 30% of the market to the private sector with full liberalisation in just two years' time.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Public Enterprise to put the full facts surrounding this sad saga before the House. Why was the ESB encouraged and allowed to make this bid? Why was the Minister for Public Enterprise not strong enough to protect the State utility of which she is the major shareholder? Why did she not take on the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste in defending the ESB decision which commercially was very sound? What does the Minister propose to do to try to promote, protect, regain and salvage the pride of one of our strongest national assets, the ESB?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Rarely have I spoken on a matter as important for our economy as the one we are discussing. The Electricity Supply Board has an <Col N="140" /> enviable reputation internationally for its expertise and skill in managing, designing and operating electricity generating stations. ESB engineers and staff have played key roles in designing and operating power plants in Britain, Malaysia, Bahrain and African countries. The advice, skill and technical expertise of these Irish workers has been much sought after at international level.</P>
      <P>In recent years there were major power failures in Britain and France due to bad storms and the ESB was asked by its counterparts in those countries to send staff to help to restore power. We were proud of our ESB staff who had the expertise to help restore such power. They displayed their ability to be challenged at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>When the European Union demanded that the ESB open the home electricity market to competition, staff and management realised that to meet this challenge it was essential for the company to continue its expansionist policy overseas. Staff and management knew that to meet this challenge it was essential to continue with its expansionist policy overseas. At the time, an agreement was reached with the Government allowing the ESB to continue overseas development to enable the board expand. The ESB was, in line with this policy, about to place a bid in excess of £1 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB was one of six shortlisted candidates invited by the Polish state treasury to lodge a bid for the acquisition of eight electricity distribution companies in Poland. The Polish group is about the same size as the ESB. The investment would have involved a potential outlay of up to 1.4 billion, with roughly l billion of that to be committed in 2002. All the investment would be funded by borrowings, with approximately half involving recourse on the ESB itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tripartite agreement of February 2000 commits the State to support international investment by the ESB as a counter to the expected <Col N="141" /> loss of market share because of the development of competition in its home market. The <i>quid pro quo</i> for this support is ESB delivery of the required electricity infrastructure programme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The two big issues which the ESB proposal presented for the State as shareholder were the financial impact on the ESB as a group and the knock-on impact on the ESB's ability to finance and deliver the roll-out of its domestic infrastructure programme. The totality of the investment plans by the ESB includes a major investment programme in the electricity networks in Ireland, the Polish investment proposal on a scale not previously attempted by the ESB and other investment plans, including new power plants at Coolkeeragh near Derry and at Bilbao in northern Spain. All the investment plans would involve a massive increase in borrowings from less than 1 billion at present to around 4 billion to 5 billion going forward to 2010. This level of borrowing raises the prospect of huge strain upon the finances of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The conclusion was that the risks associated with a project of the sheer scale of the Polish one at this time outweighed the potential benefits. There was particular concern over the potential implications of the investment for the core business in Ireland, in particular, concern at the possible impact on funding roll-out and delivery of the domestic electricity infrastructure programme. The risk in the Polish proposal of over-extending management resources and dissipating management focus at this time was an additional significant concern, given the competition challenge facing the company in its home market. The decision reached was no different from that which might have been arrived at by a private commercial shareholder in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the ESB has spent a sum of £10 million so far on the Polish bid process. This is not correct. The ESB has confirmed that the actual figure is closer to 3.5 million, which would be within the normal expenditure range at this point for a process of this nature.</P>
    <P>The stated commitment to a growth strategy for the ESB as a counter to the anticipated loss of market share at home remains firmly in place, subject to tangible progress in meeting the challenges facing the company on the home front. The ESB has, over the years, received unstinting support from my Department for its non-core, international business. The Ocean deal, the Moneypoint leasing transaction, the issue of the Corby plant in the UK and the recent investment in a power plant at Port Dixon in Malaysia are some of the most obvious examples.</P>
    <P>The ESB is currently developing other potentially attractive international investment proposals involving new state-of-the-art power plants at Bilbao in northern Spain and Coolkeeragh near Derry. The company is keeping the Department informed of progress on these proposals <Col N="142" /> and has indicated that it expects to be in a position to seek shareholder approval for these investments later in the year.</P>
    <P>For the present, the outcome of the ballot of ESB staff on the new change programme is awaited and we look forward to the launch of that programme, including the accelerated roll-out of the domestic infrastructure programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me raise this issue. It is close to his heart, having been a former Minister for Health. It relates to subventions and the assessment of families living in the family home. In the case of a family member still resident there, the home is considered by the health board as available for renting. This clause must be dropped. It is causing much hardship to family members who require nursing home care.</P>
      <P>Subvention is paid to those who need care under three headings: a minimum care sum of £95 per week, which was increased recently; a medium care sum of £120 per week; and a maximum care sum of £150 per week. Everybody welcomes the increases in the moneys because there had been no increases for seven or eight years.</P>
      <P>The regulation states that a house belonging to an individual who might be applying for subvention, when a family member still lives there, is available for renting. It is unfair for the local health board to state that the house is available for renting and that there must to be an amount of money derived in this manner as income to go towards care.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not think this regulation is draconian, taking into consideration the recent decision of the Ombudsman, who said that family members are made pay unfairly, and that health boards are sorting out the backlog of applications for repayment of money? Is this not an example of flawed legislation?</P>
      <P>I was in contact with the health board this morning. People who have applied for the refund of money, because of the health board regulations, will have no money available to them. No case will be dealt with until August this year. Three months ago, the Ombudsman made a recommendation and we are still awaiting results in this regard. The health board informed me that the Department of Health and Children is the culprit.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say if he is prepared to change the regulations? They are wrong in terms of determining people's income when family members are living in the family home, especially when one considers that the health board is stating, under the regulations introduced by the Department, that a house in the country, which it might not be possible to rent, has to be regarded as worth £80 per week and that this sum will lower the subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows exactly what I am saying, coming from a rural constituency like myself. The problem to which I am referring is serious and requires action on the part of the Department and the Minister. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is also from a rural constituency and knows what I am talking about. There is a serious problem that requires action from the Department to address it, not another report from the Ombudsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged are private arrangements between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets <Col N="144" /> of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse.</P>
    <P>The residence of a person seeking a subvention is treated as a special asset and is not taken into account in certain circumstances, i.e., if it is occupied immediately prior to, or at the time of the application and continues to be occupied by a spouse, son or daughter under 21 years or in full-time education or a relative in receipt of certain benefits from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The purpose of this regulation is to avoid causing undue hardship where the home of a person seeking subvention is occupied by a dependent relative.</P>
    <P>While section 13 of the regulations provides that a health board may impute an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of the person, this is only invoked if the residence was not occupied immediately prior to or at the time of the application by a dependant as I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance. Nonetheless, as the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of the Minister for Health and Children to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>In addition, sons' and daughters' income is no longer assessed since January 1999. That has been disregarded.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 July 2001.</P>

      <P>Article 47.3 of the Constitution provides that the right to vote at a referendum shall be confined to citizens of Ireland who are eligible to vote at Dáil elections. The extension of the right to vote at a referendum to resident nationals of another country would, irrespective of the topic of any referendum, require an enactment of the Constitution. Proposals for such an amendment have not been sponsored in the past nor are they at present envisaged.</P>

      <P>Under planning legislation, each planning authority is obliged to prepare a development plan setting out an overall strategy for the planning and development of its area. Such plans would include the policy of the authority on the provision of one-off single houses. Decisions on individual applications are also a matter for each authority or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards single houses in rural areas, it is essential that the farming community and those working on the land should be able to live in the country. However, a continuation of the current <Col N="146" /> trends in one-off housing, particularly with regard to urban generated development, that is, development by those working in urban areas, will have significant implications in terms of a range of issues such as transport, the possibilities for strengthening many of our towns and villages, landscape and tourism and protection of ground and surface waters. The report, Sustainable Development &ndash; A Strategy for Ireland, indicated that, in general, there should be a presumption against urban-generated, one-off rural housing adjacent to towns.</P>
    <P>The implications of the current trends in housing in rural areas will be addressed in the preparation of the national spatial strategy. It is my intention to publish shortly proposals for discussion on an approach to promoting more balanced regional development, together with indications of the spatial policies that might be adopted to promote new patterns of development in Ireland over the next 20 years.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is taking arising from the recent report of the Ombudsman which found that the administration of the planning system was in a state of collapse; if, in view of the Ombudsman's findings, he will consider the establishment of a planning inspectorate to enforce planning regulations and conditions and investigate complaints from the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the recent annual report by the Ombudsman acknowledges, there has been a huge increase in planning applications in the past few years in line with the growth in the economy. Planning authorities have responded to this increase by improving their productivity enormously. However, increasing demands on planning departments has stretched resources and, as the report highlighted, has led to difficulties, in particular in relation to planning enforcement.</P>
      <P>I am strongly of the view that a culture of enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. I therefore brought forward simplified and strengthened provisions on enforcement in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. These changes should address some of the concerns of the Ombudsman, in particular the requirement on local authorities to keep complainants updated as enforcement actions proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. Due to the scale and complexity of the Act and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date, I have made three commencement orders <Col N="147" /> bringing into force a number of Parts of the Act. The commencement orders for the development control and enforcement provisions of the Act will be made in tandem with the necessary regulations, some of which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Work on these regulations is now at an advanced stage and a draft will be submitted to the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
    <P>I am also acutely aware of the need to ensure adequate staffing of local authority planning departments. My Department has been taking a variety of measures to address this issue. I have approved numerous requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional planners and administrative staff, although I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts. Nevertheless, staffing levels are increasing.</P>
    <P>A survey by my Department of the larger local authority planning departments, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, carried out in January 2001 found that the overall level of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to 1,090, which compared with a figure of 1,066 in October 2000, 994 in July 2000 and 895 in September 1999. I have also liaised with the Minister for Education and Science and the third level education sector on ways of producing more planners through the education system. In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report acknowledged that these changes were being made and stated his intention to monitor the area closely over the coming year. In light of this and because I believe enforcement is best carried out at local level, I do not propose to establish a national planning inspectorate to deal with enforcement.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Part IX of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, Government Orders were made on 19 June 2001 designating three sites as strategic development zones for residential development designed to support the provision of almost 12,000 housing units in the Dublin and mid-east regions.</P>
      <P>The three sites that have been designated are Adamstown in Lucan which has the capacity to deliver up to 8,000 housing units, Hansfield in Blanchardstown which has the capacity to deliver about 2,500 housing units and Clonmagadden Valley in Navan which has the capacity to provide about 1,400 housing units. My Department has written to the three local authorities concerned asking them to put in train the necessary work to advance the preparation of planning schemes and the delivery of infrastructure and other work necessary for the development of these sites.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my statement welcoming the Government's decision, the designation of these sites should be viewed against the backdrop of very positive progress in advancing the planning of major residential sites in Dublin since the proposal to use strategic development zones for residential development was first conceived last year. Local area plans have been finalised for key residential sites in Dublin city and county including the North Fringe, Pelletstown, Stepaside, Killinarden/ Kiltipper, Ballycullen/Stocking Lane, Lusk, Swords North, Diswellstown/Porterstown/Tyrellstown and the Phoenix Park Racecourse. I have already stated that I will be keeping progress on the development of these sites under review and I am prepared to bring further proposals to Government at a later stage for the designation of additional sites as strategic development zones as necessary.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons killed and injured in road traffic accidents during 2000 and to date in 2001; if, in regard to the Government strategy on road safety, he will list those commitments which have been implemented and those which have not been implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of road deaths in 2000 was <Col N="149" /> 415. This is a 12% decrease on the 1997 level of 472. Provisional returns for this year show that 185 people have been killed on the roads in the six months ended 30 June compared with 196 for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly pursuing the implementation of its Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Irish Government. The strategy has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose First Progress Report (July 1999) and Second Progress Report (August 2000) detail progress with key actions. Copies of both reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The second progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. In addition to the reduced level of roads deaths to which I have already referred, serious injuries decreased in the 1997-2000 period by over 15% relative to a similar reduction target of 20% by end 2002. The interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met. A third progress report will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 268 schemes completed by end 2000 and a further 88 approved. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reducing speeding and increasing seat belt wearing.</P>
      <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the Road Safety Strategy. Over 224,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 2000, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2000, approximately 84,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 2000 increased by 24% over 1998. Evidential breath testing was ahead of target by end of 2000 with 25 instruments in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> The Road Safety Strategy also provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was published in March 2001. My Department is also working to ensure the availability of a national driver file, complete with penalty points functionality, within the present year.</P>
    <P>Ensuring compliance with the targets of the Road Safety Strategy will command the full effort and support of the Government and its agencies. By reference to the estimates set out in the strategy in 1998, over 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998.</P>

      <P>The Government has taken a wide range of measures to increase housing supply, remove infrastructural and planning bottlenecks, moderate increases in house prices and to improve affordability of housing particularly for first time purchasers. The policy objectives and Government measures have been set out in Action on House Prices (April 1998), Action on the Housing Market (March 1999) and Action on Housing (June 2000).</P>
      <P>There is clear evidence that the Government's actions over the last few years have had a significantly positive impact, in the face of strongly rising demand for housing. Total new housing output in 2000 was almost 50,000 units, an increase of 7% over the 1999 total, the sixth consecutive year of record housing output. House price data for recent months indicate further moderation in the rate of increase in average house prices. There is also firm evidence that first-time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market.</P>
      <P>The provision of £6 billion for social and affordable housing in the National Development Plan, augmented by further investment of almost £1 billion announced in Action on Housing, will ensure that the social and affordable housing needs of almost 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to implementing major reforms in the private rented residential sector, arising from the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. These measures, which include establishment of a private residential tenancies board to deal with <Col N="151" /> disputes between landlords and tenants, legislation to provide improved security of tenure for tenants and targeted tax and supply incentives to promote further investment in the sector, should facilitate the development of a better managed and more professional private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to monitor housing developments and to review policies as necessary to ensure that the unprecedented expansion in housing demand associated with our economic success is met in a sustainable way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 84 and 302 together.</P>
      <P>Irish Water Safety prepared and published its recent Beach Safety Report 2001 at my request; a copy is available in the Oireachtas Library. The report provides valuable guidance for local authorities and other bodies in relation to safety at beaches and bathing places, and I welcome it accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Beach Safety Report makes recommendations which address a range of issues including the making of bye-laws by local authorities in relation to the management of beaches and bathing areas; the importance of the role and functions of water safety development officers in local authorities; the identification and sign-posting of dangerous beaches; the zoning and supervision of bathing areas at major resorts; and the provision of lifeguards and lifeguard equipment.</P>
      <P>These recommendations are directed principally at local authorities, and Irish Water Safety has made copies of its report available to them. In addition, my Department has written to local authorities emphasising the importance of carrying these recommendations into effect.</P>
      <P>Attention has been drawn in the media to a statement in the report to the effect that recommendations of beach surveys have not always been acted upon by local authorities. Such surveys would normally be carried out by Irish Water Safety at the request of local authorities. I understand from Irish Water Safety that this statement was never intended to convey the impression that local authorities had failed either to identify and sign inherently dangerous beaches, or to address other major risk factors. The reality is that the statement was intended to refer to relatively minor recommendations within beach surveys, such as the location for a ring-buoy stand or the format of signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Water Safety &ndash; previously a part of the National Safety Council &ndash; was established in November 1999 as an independent statutory body <Col N="153" /> with responsibility for the promotion of water safety, and this action was taken largely in response to the wishes of the volunteer corps on which the organisation depends to teach swimming and lifesaving. The organisation is financed mainly through a grant from my Department which will amount to £316,000 in the current year. Income is also derived from other sources, mainly through fund-raising by local area committees and contributions from local authorities. In total, this other income is estimated at some £175,000 in the current year. I am hopeful also that Irish Water Safety will, in time, be in a position to secure significant sponsorship from the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the organisation is well placed, financially and organisationally, to carry forward the important work of promoting water safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The report in question relates to interim results (for the first three months) of a 12 month monitoring programme of some 800 private group water schemes which is being conducted by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee. This programme has the objective of compiling a comprehensive data base on source water quality for group schemes. The data will be used to aid the selection and procurement of appropriate water filtration and disinfection equipment for group water schemes nationally.</P>
      <P>The interim test results relate to raw water samples which were taken prior to any treatment, and not at consumers' taps. They have been made available on the clear understanding that the analytical findings are subject to further scrutiny and that they should not be confused with the monitoring of drinking water standards which must take place at the point of consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drinking water sampling is carried out by the local authorities on both public and private schemes and is reported on by the Environmental Protection Agency in its annual drinking water report. It would be premature to draw any con<Col N="154" /> clusions from the interim source sampling until the full 12 months programme has been completed and the analytical findings are properly verified.</P>
    <P>My Department is fully conscious of water quality deficiencies affecting group water schemes. The most recent report by the EPA on the quality of drinking water shows a welcome reduction, from 42% to 38%, in the level of coliform exceedances in group schemes. The remaining quality problem centres on privately sourced schemes that supply some 5% of households nationally. The Government's determination to address this problem is demonstrated by the record £420 million being provided for the rural water programme under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The bulk of this funding is intended for the upgrading and renewal of deficient group schemes. Annual spending on rural water has increased from £8.5 million in 1996 to some £50 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>Last year saw a radical restructuring and improvement of group scheme capital grants. These grants were increased from the former 75% of cost, subject to a cost limit of £1,600 per house, to 85% with a cost limit of £6,000 per house. For the first time ever, a new 100% capital grant was introduced for the provision of essential water treatment and disinfection equipment in privately sourced schemes.</P>
    <P>The National Federation of Group Water Schemes, with my Department's support, is also introducing a quality assurance scheme for the group water sector that will require all privately sourced schemes to achieve specific performance standards with regard to administration, management and operation.</P>
    <P>New drinking water regulations made last December require all group water schemes serving 50 persons or more to reach the stringent standards for drinking water quality by the end of 2003. Rapid strides are being made to tackle and overcome the difficulties affecting the group scheme sector in order to meet that deadline. Overall I am satisfied that the rural water programme is dealing effectively with, and will resolve the deficiencies in, group supplies in the shortest possible timescale.</P>

      <P>The Referendum Commission was allocated £1 million in respect of the referendum on the Abolition of the Death Penalty, a further £1 million in respect of the referendum on the International Criminal Court and £2.5 million in respect of the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. I am not in a position at present to provide a breakdown of actual expenditure incurred in relation to these referendums as the commission is still processing payments arising from its information campaigns. I understand, however, that the commission completed its tasks within budget. The commission will provide a report to me within six months of carrying outs its functions and this will include a detailed breakdown of expenditures.

      <P>Section 96(15) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that permissions for residential development granted after 25 August 1999 but before the housing strategy is included in the relevant development plan in accordance with the Act, will last until 31 December 2002 or for two years, whichever is longer. This provision was included in Part V of the Act to prevent developers &lsquo;stockpiling' planning permissions which would not be subject to the requirement to reserve land-houses for social and affordable housing. It will therefore ensure that the Act applies fairly and equally to developers as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once housing strategies have been incorporated in development plans, planning permissions will be granted for five years. Land authorities are required to make their housing strategies by <Col N="156" /> end July 2001. I do not propose to amend Part V of the Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>I envisage that the national spatial strategy will be published as promised at the end of this year. Following an initial round of public consultation, my Department completed and published a report on the scope of the strategy, setting out the issues and challenges it needed to address and a work programme to ensure its delivery by the end of this year. This was followed by a period of extensive research during which a wide range of issues such as population and labour force projections, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, factors driving the location of enterprise, quality of life issues, infrastructure and environmental protection were analysed and assessed.</P>
      <P>Based on that research and taking account of further extensive consultations which have taken place at regional and local level involving the social partners, sustainable development partners and with other representative groups, I intend to publish shortly proposals for discussion on an approach to more balanced regional development together with indications of the spatial policies that might be adopted to promote new patterns of development in Ireland over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>Publication of the policy indications will be followed by a further intensive period of consultations. Following that, and taking account of the responses and views received during the consultation phase, proposals for inclusion in the strategy itself will be further developed with a view to having the strategy completed and published by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which was published on 28 March 2001, has the principal purpose of providing for the introduction of a penalty points system. I intend that this legislation will be enacted this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to new legislation, a number of other initiatives must be taken to facilitate the introduction and administration of a penalty points system. Section 25 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which will require full driving licence holders to carry their licences while driving, will be commenced at the appropriate time. The administration of the system will also need to be supported by the computerisation of the national driver file &ndash; NDF &ndash; which is currently being completed. In parallel with the completed NDF, a project team involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service has developed a business specification for a penalty points functionality to be added on to the NDF. Proposals for the consultancy contract for taking this work forward are currently being assessed in the Department and the contract will be awarded shortly. It is intended that the necessary work for the addition of a penalty point functionality to the NDF will be completed by the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>The successful operation of the penalty points system will also depend on IT improvements being developed by the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service in relation to fixed charge payments and court convictions for penalty point offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 340 together.</P>
      <P>Water conservation is a major focus of planned investment in water services under the national development plan. The NDP provides for expenditure of £550 million on the rehabilitation and management of water and waste water infrastructure, of which £291 million has been allocated to water conservation measures. The NDP also includes provision of £645 million for other water supply works, including distribution network extensions and increases in treatment capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strategic study of the greater Dublin water supply was completed in 1996 which estimated that unaccounted for water represented 44% of the total water produced in the greater Dublin region. A major water conservation programme costing £39 million, launched on foot of the report, was completed in the Dublin region during 2000. The effectiveness of the programme can be gauged by, <i>inter alia</i>, capacity being available to service 25,000 extra housing units, the cessation of night water rationing previously affecting up to 150,000 consumers and a 5% to 10% increase in city water pressures. Unaccounted for water in the region &ndash; mainly water that is produced at source but lost from the system due to <Col N="159" /> leakage &ndash; was reduced by 16%. Further reductions in unaccounted for water will be achieved through the ongoing active leakage control measures being operated by the local authorities concerned and upcoming proposals for substantial mains rehabilitation. The outcome of the Dublin region water conservation programme establishes that water conservation, in addition to the environmental benefits, is a practical, realistic and economic way of meeting much of the extra demand facing local authorities generally due to social and economic expansion.</P>
    <P>In addition to the physical improvement to the distribution network, regular public awareness campaigns are carried out at local level by the Dublin authorities to encourage the public to conserve water by eliminating wasteful usage. At national level, a major awareness campaign was launched by the Department in 1999 to encourage individual action and shared responsibility towards the environment. The campaign is designed to address key environmental themes, including water conservation.</P>
    <P>As regards the position outside Dublin, a comprehensive study of all large water supply schemes was carried out for my Department in 2000. The study examined 91 water supply schemes, operated by some 38 local authorities, and reported on all aspects of supply, including availability of raw water, treatment capacity, capacity and condition of water distribution systems and associated management issues. As a direct response to the study, I announced earlier this year an investment package of almost £300 million for an expanded national water conservation programme and a range of other measures to deal with the issues identified in the study. The new water conservation programme aims to substantially reduce current levels of unaccounted for water, thereby improving the level of supply to customers, lowering operating costs and maximising the value of investment in capital works.</P>
    <P>Comparisons in costings between water conservation measures and increases in treated water capacity vary from scheme to scheme, depending on individual circumstances. However, at current high leakage levels, water conservation would generally be the more cost efficient option where it was capable of producing the increased yield required.</P>

      <P>The building regulations do not place a restriction on the use of any particular method of construction or product, provided the performance requirements of the regulations are met, for example, in relation to thermal performance and structural stability. It is a matter for building owners, designers and builders to ensure that their buildings comply with the regulations and to select the form of construction and product which best meets their needs in achieving this.</P>
      <P>Technical guidance document L, which accompanies the regulations, provides guidance on the thermal performance standards of various elements in buildings, including roofs, walls and so on. For typical construction, the technical guidance document provides guidance on determining the thickness of insulation material required to achieve the standards, taking account of the thermal properties of both the insulation and the basic construction.</P>
      <P>In November 2000, I published my proposals for revised thermal performance and insulation requirements for new dwellings. I intend to publish a draft of the revised technical guidance document L as a consultation document shortly. All interested parties will then have an opportunity to comment during the consultation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 100 and 316 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Kyoto Protocol the EU has a joint greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 8% below 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012 and under the burden sharing agreement within the EU, Ireland has a target to limit its increase in these emissions to 13% above 1990 levels in the same period.</P>
      <P>The national climate change strategy, November 2000, sets out how Ireland will achieve its target over the next ten years. The strategy identifies a range of cross-sectoral and sector specific measures to secure the necessary reductions equitably, and with economic and environmental efficiency. Implementation of the strategy is being co-ordinated by a cross-departmental climate change team, chaired by my Department, which has met on eight occasions since January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial measures identified in the strategy for their potential to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions limitation are under way at a sectoral level. Examples include a new renewable energy competition announced on 25 May 2001, and the recent granting of full market access to electricity from combined heat and power. Substantial investment in public transport under the NDP will help reduce reliance on the private car, especially in Dublin. Necessary changes to the building regulations to reduce energy require<Col N="166" /> ments are being accelerated to ensure full implementation well ahead of the 2005 date in the strategy.</P>
    <P>Ireland's emissions of greenhouse gases are currently more than 20% above 1990 levels, and on a business as usual basis, without implementation of the measures in the national climate change strategy, are projected to rise by up to 37% above 1990 levels by 2010. The strategy is specifically designed to make the necessary reductions against these business as usual projections over the coming decade. Sectoral measures included in the strategy are intended to reduce emissions by over 15 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per annum during the commitment period 2008 to 2012; this will ensure that our target is met effectively and on time, so that Ireland properly meets its international obligations in this area and is not exposed to penalties in the future.</P>
    <P>Development of an appropriate compliance regime, including options for penalties linked to the extent of non-compliance with Kyoto targets, is being discussed in international negotiations. The sixth conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP6, will be resuming in Bonn from 14 to 28 July, 2001 and Ireland will be participating fully in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have been advised, in the waste policy statement, 1998, Changing our Ways, that achievement of national waste objectives requires, <i>inter alia,</i> a major reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of treatment options to deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets. The authorities have been asked to identify and fully assess the various issues involved, with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix of facilities which, at a regional level, appear to offer the best balance at reasonable costs between maximised recovery of materials or energy and minimised environmental emissions. Against this background, the regional and local waste management plans, now at various stages of preparation and adoption, had proposed the development of six thermal treatment facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the EPA's national hazardous waste management plan, which will be published shortly, identifies a need for a national hazardous waste thermal treatment facility. It is also open to the private sector to bring forward proposals for thermal treatment facilities on a commercial <Col N="167" /> basis. All thermal treatment facilities, whether proposed on a public private partnership, or commercial, basis will be subject to rigorous planning and environmental licensing controls.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented housing stock is primarily the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources and I understand that local authorities spent over £130 million for this purpose in 1999 which is the most recent year for which complete figures are available to my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department is also committed to providing very significant funding over the period of the national development plan to meet the capital cost of major redevelopment and refurbishment programmes which authorities could not meet from their own resources. This year some £150 million in capital funding is available to local authorities for the remedial works scheme which assists local authorities in carrying out major essential works to dwellings which were constructed prior to 1 January 1960 or which have serious design or construction defects and to run-down urban estates; the comprehensive regeneration of Ballymun which will involve the demolition of the high rise flat blocks and their replacement with new housing units; the redevelopment of a number of seriously run down flat complexes in Dublin and Cork involving a mix of new build, refurbishment and, where appropriate, demolition and replacement; and the special area regeneration programme in Dublin which consists of a once-off programme of upgrading high density older flat complexes at various locations around the city.</P>
      <P>I consider that this level of funding, including both from my Department and the local authorities' own resources, should enable local authorities to bring about substantial improvements to the standard of their existing housing stock over the coming years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>The new taxi regime which has been established by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, is already bringing significant benefits to service users through the increased availability of taxis.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent survey, &ldquo;The Quality of Dublin's City-Centre Taxi Service: A Peak-Time Survey&rdquo;, which was carried out on behalf of the National Taxi Drivers' Union by the Centre for Urban and Regional Studies, Trinity College, Dublin. This survey is based on the experience of three Dublin city centre taxi ranks at peak times midweek and at weekends during the week of 22 April 2001. Its conclusions indicate improvement in service provision at certain times of the day, with problems persisting in relation to night time taxi services at weekends. While noting these limited conclusions, I anticipate that benefits to service users will have accumulated in the meantime with further new service providers becoming fully mobilised. I also note that the survey acknowledges the need for more detailed studies and surveys. In this regard, I am aware that Dublin Corporation, as the largest taxi licensing authority in the country, has engaged consultants to carry out a customer service assessment so as to compare current service levels with those obtaining during the last such assessment in 1998 and to identify potential areas for further service improvement. I anticipate that this study will provide more broadly based and up to date information on the level of taxi services in Dublin under the new regime.</P>
      <P>With regard to the survey findings in relation to the availability of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, I have already put on record my intention that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles accessible. As regards quality of taxi vehicles, the same vehicle standards continue to apply in relation to new taxi licences as operated prior to the liberalisation of taxi licensing, with the exception of the present annual testing of vehicles by the National Car Testing Service instead of two-yearly as previously.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, I have already indicated that it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons, of taxi service providers and others to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term, for the benefit of both service providers and the public alike.  My Department will finalise a consultation document in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <P>Information available from the 1999 assessment of housing need indicates that more than two-thirds of households assessed as in need of local authority housing were on the local authority waiting list for less than two years and it remains the case that a significant number of households on waiting lists are housed within two years. Some applicants for local authority housing, however, are on waiting lists for longer periods on the basis that their priority for housing is relatively lower compared with the needs of households who have been allocated housing.</P>

      <P>The North-South Ministerial Council, as part of its programme for co-operation on transport, adopted a mandate for enhanced co-operation on road safety matters in December 2000. As part of that mandate it was agreed that the National Safety Council and the Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland) would continue to develop road safety campaigns with one such campaign envisaged annually. Joint road safety awareness campaigns are particularly suitable for North-South co-operation as they generate economies of scale both in terms of production costs and of television and other media exposure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuance of the above mandate, Mr Sam Foster, Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland and I recently launched &ldquo;Damage&rdquo; a seat belt wearing advertisement. This campaign is aimed at encouraging road users to wear their seat belts. It follows the joint campaigns that have <Col N="173" /> been undertaken in the past in relation to speeding and drink-driving.</P>
    <P>Increased seat belt wearing is a key target area for the road safety strategy along with speeding and drink driving. Advertising campaigns such as this &ldquo;Damage&rdquo; campaign will contribute towards the achievement of higher seat belt wearing rates. The Government strategy for road safety, 1998-2002, sets a target of 85% wearing rate for front and rear seat belts which when achieved could result in saving an additional 30 lives each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 333 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the European Commission on the quality of bathing water for the 2000 bathing season, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, confirms that Irish bathing waters are among the best in Europe in terms of water quality. This report indicates that 98.3% of Irish coastal bathing areas comply with the mandatory EU values and 91.7% comply with the stricter guide values. Local authorities are required to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the standards prescribed in relation to designated bathing waters by the Quality of Bathing Waters Regulations, 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> The provision of sewage treatment plants at various locations, including seaside tourist resorts, is a matter for each individual local authority in the first instance. In this regard authorities are required to prepare an assessment of needs every five years. The main purpose of the assessments is to develop an overall strategic investment plan for the area concerned for the medium to long-term and to set out a programme of works to meet the identified water services needs. The most recent assessments, completed by authorities in 1999, were adopted as the main basis for the inclusion of schemes in the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, which was announced in July 2000 and provides for investment of £2.1 billion in water and sewerage services. The investment programme for 2000-2002 is the first phase of a rolling three-year programme that will continue up to the end of the NDP in 2006. Further waste water schemes will be approved in the next phase of the programme which will roll it forward to 2003.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 almost £3 billion will be spent on water and sewerage services, three times the out-turn under the previous NDP. Over £1.1 billion of this is being allocated to wastewater measures. Not only will this underpin this Government's continuing commitment to strengthening our infrastructure and facilitating economic development, but it will also protect our natural resources and assist compliance with relevant legislation and EU directives. This massive investment is designed to build on the success already achieved in relation to the quality of bathing waters.</P>
    <P>Funding for urban wastewater infrastructure under the water services investment programme is focused on meeting the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. This requires treatment of all wastewater discharges from systems with a population equivalent of more than 2000 by the end of 2005. Of the 37 agglomerations without treatment referred to in the most recent EPA report on urban waste water discharges in Ireland, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, the current water services investment programme includes schemes to provide secondary treatment, or better, in 31 of those locations. These schemes represent almost 99% of the total effluent load. Schemes already in progress or scheduled to start in 2001 and 2002 will meet the treatment requirements for over 97% of the total load.</P>
    <P>Major schemes are being completed throughout the country including the Dublin Bay project which is the largest together with Cork, Galway and Limerick main drainage schemes. The Dublin Bay Project will significantly improve bathing water quality in Dublin Bay. Other significant schemes designed to protect our coastal waters being progressed during the current NDP period will provide for upgraded facilities in areas such as Ardmore, Tramore, Westport, Donegal and Sligo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> Additional protection for estuarine and coastal waters will be provided arising from regulations which I recently made to designate 30 additional water bodies as sensitive areas for the purposes of urban wastewater treatment. These designated areas include 15 estuarine waters and will require a higher level of treatment for effluents discharged into those waters from large sewage treatment plants.</P>

      <P>Following a review of the trophic status of estuarine and coastal waters in Ireland by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Liffey estuary was recently designated as a sensitive water for the purposes of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. The design of the Ringsend wastewater treatment works takes account of this status and the findings of the environmental studies carried out prior to and during the design phase of the project. The new works will provide primary, secondary and tertiary treatment of waste water. The tertiary treatment to be provided will consist of the removal of nitrogen from the treated sewage and final disinfection of the wastewater by ultra-violet light, which will eliminate bacteria. All elements of the Dublin Bay Project are now either under construction or at an advanced stage of planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 327 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that they consider the adequacy of their staffing to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. While my Department has approved requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála for sanction for additional professional planner posts, I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts.</P>
    <P>A survey by my Department of the larger local authority planning departments &ndash; i.e. county councils and county borough corporations &ndash; carried out on 31 January 2001 found that the overall number of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to 1,090, which compared with a figure of 1,066 in October, 2000, 994 in July 2000 and 895 in September 1999. In relation to professional planners specifically, the January survey found that there was a total of 394 authorised posts for professional planners, 66 of which were vacant at that time, i.e. the total number of serving professional planners was 328. The number of planners in county councils and county boroughs in January 2001 is outlined in the following table.</P>
    <P>In relation to An Bord Pleanála, in July 2000 I approved an increase of 29 additional staff &ndash; nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff &ndash; which brought An Bord Pleanála's authorised staff complement to 134, excluding board members. Recruitment of these additional staff is ongoing. Any proposal by An Bord Pleanála to engage the services of planners on a fee per case basis is a matter for the board and my Department's approval is not required. I am, however, aware that the board does employ planners on this basis and that a number have been recruited from the UK. I am also aware of plans by the board to engage private planning consultancy firms to assist in dealing with the large number of appeals on hand and that UK companies have submitted tenders.</P>
    <P>In June 2000, I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 square metres to 40 square metres. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas, to allow planners to concentrate on more complex applications and forward planning issues.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September 2000 new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum.</P>
    <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed <Col N="177" /> term contracts is being pursued. My Department met with the Housing and Infrastructure Committee of the City and County Managers Association at the end of last year to set out the range of measures that the Department proposed to undertake to recruit contract planners from abroad. In addition, the matter was also raised on a number of occasions directly by me at meetings on housing issues with the local authority managers in the greater Dublin area. In this regard, my Department, along with a number of local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, has also participated in the FÁS Jobs Ireland Campaign and other recruitment initiatives over the last few months to source professional planners on a contract basis. As a result of this, 27 qualified planners have been now offered planning positions in the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála on a <Col N="178" /> contract basis. A significant additional number of applications have been submitted from abroad for positions as planners in the local authority sector in Ireland. More than 50 of these applicants have been shortlisted and arrangements are being made to interview them shortly. The Local Government Management Services Board is now managing this process and extending it to target other construction professionals, such as engineers, architects, quantity surveyors and technicians.</P>
    <P>In this regard, an advertisement was lodged by the Local Government Management Services Board with the EU Official Journal on 5 June seeking proposals from suitable companies to source such staff to work in the local authorities on a contract basis.</P>

      <P>Under the Town Renewal Act, 2000, it is a matter for the relevant local authorities to propose sites for designation for tax incentives within the area covered by town renewal plans.</P>
      <P>In doing so, local authorities are assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them by my Department. These set out the purposes and aims of the town renewal scheme, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. Local authorities were advised that the extent of proposed designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plan should be proposed for designation.</P>
      <P>The role of the expert panel was to assess proposals from local authorities and to recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted. The panel comprised individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation etc. and was confined to examining the sites recommended by the local authorities by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines.</P>
      <P>In the course of its examination of plans, the panel sought clarification from local authorities on various issues where this was considered necessary. The expert advisory panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. In the case of Tallow, 12 of the 14 sites proposed for designation by Waterford County Council were granted most or all of the incentives requested and designations are now being implemented accordingly. It is not proposed to make further designations under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The designation process described above has been carefully structured and I do not consider that it requires or could practically accommodate the addition of an appeals system.</P>

      <P>The objective of the national spatial strategy, to be published at the end of the year, is to ensure more balanced regional development. The two documents referred to are a timely and valuable helpful input to the preparation of the strategy. The strategy will provide a framework within which different areas can develop in a way which fosters balanced regional development, while continuing to meet the other key national objectives set out under the national development plan relating to sustaining economic and employment growth, competitiveness and promoting social inclusion.  </P>
      <P>The continued economic success of the greater Dublin area will be a key focus of the national spatial strategy. The issues arising in the greater Dublin area are already being addressed within the framework of the strategic planning guidelines for the area, the Dublin Transportation Office's long-term transportation strategy, a Platform for Change, and the proposed new institutional arrangements for land use and transport co-ordination in the area.</P>

      <P>The Framework for Action on Infrastructural Development published by the Government in November 1999 and the consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, published by the Minister for Public Enterprise in August 2000 indicated that the institutional arrangements for public transport in the greater Dublin area would be reviewed. Subsequently, the Public Transport Partnership Forum, established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and the Dublin Transportation Office commented on the need for institutional reform for transport and land-use planning in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, the Government, in April of this year, published a consultation paper on institutional arrangements for land use and <Col N="181" /> transport planning in the greater Dublin area. The consultation paper proposed that a new strategic land use and transport body for the greater Dublin area should be established. The proposed body would be responsible for strategic land use and transport planning and have statutory powers to supervise and ensure implementation of strategies and programmes by all implementing agencies, for example, local authorities and public transport operators. The authority would also act as a public transport regulator for the greater Dublin area, and be responsible for the allocation of funding to implementing agencies for public transport, non-national roads and traffic management.</P>
    <P>The paper proposed that the authority would comprise a council  &ndash; representing local authority elected representatives and managers, social partners, and government nominees &ndash; and a small executive board, and that the authority would be accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The consultation period for these proposals ended on 8 June and 49 submissions have been received by my Department. A cross-departmental team has been established to consider the outcome of the consultation process and to prepare the necessary legislation. In the light of this work, it is intended to bring detailed proposals to the Government later in the year.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations 1997 and 1998 prescribe regulatory traffic signs which include upright signs, road markings, traffic lights and other devices. The Traffic Signs Manual published by the Department in 1996 provides information on traffic signs and road markings generally, including information and warning signs; a copy of the manual is in the Oireachtas Library. The manual provides a comprehensive guide to the provision of road signage in Ireland and sets out the technical and other standards to be followed in the provision and maintenance of signs. The use of the manual is intended over time to lead to greater uniformity of practice and to the creation of a more consistent approach to signing generally.</P>
      <P>The provision and maintenance of traffic signs is primarily the responsibility of individual local road authorities, in consultation with the Garda Síochána in the case of regulatory signs. The National Roads Authority has assumed direct responsibility for the provision of directional signage and delineation on national roads. In addition, the NRA has published guidelines on Traffic Calming for Towns and Villages on National Routes (1999).</P>
      <P>In its role of oversight of the non-national roads programme, my Department issued a circular letter to road authorities in August 1998 emphasising the importance of providing and maintaining a high standard of road signage. My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads, which issued on 5 February 2001, again reminded local authorities of the need to bring their signage on the non-national road network up to the standards of the Traffic Signs Manual.</P>
      <P>The replacement of road signs showing distances in imperial measurements has been in progress on a phased basis over the past few years on all national roads. The replacement of such signs on non-national roads, which is a much more extensive programme, has also been under way for some time and is continuing against a target completion date of end 2005 recently established by the European Communities (Units of Measurement) (Amendment) Regulations, 2001.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet Committee on <Col N="188" /> Infrastructure and Public-Private Partnerships has met five times so far this year. The meetings were held in February, March, April, May and June. The next meeting is on Wednesday 4 July. I expect that we will continue to meet on a monthly basis for the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure and PPPs is an integral part of Government and, as with any Cabinet committee, its meetings are an integral part of the business of Government. The practice has grown up, over time, of allowing questions in the House as to the date and number of meetings of such committees. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality. A great deal of work is being done on all aspects of the infrastructure agenda. Questions on particular aspects should be put down to the relevant Minister.  </P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that 2001 is the year of the bi-centenary of the Act of Union and that there has been little public debate on this occasion, he will seek to make arrangements with the Ulster Museum in Belfast to allow its exhibition on the Act of Union to be brought here as an aid to better inform people on the events and public debates which took place leading up to the signing of the Act of Union.</Quest>

      <P>In June 1999, the Keough-Notre Dame Centre and the Byrne-Perry Summer School were awarded £5,000 from my Department's commemorative initiatives fund towards the costs of two related conferences on the Act of Union and publication of their proceedings. The Royal Irish Academy held a conference on the Act of Union in June 2000 which was also supported from the commemoration initiatives fund to the amount of £800. The Deputy's suggestion with regard to the Ulster Museum's exhibition will be followed up with the <Col N="191" /> National Museum through the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain essential services currently undertaken by participants on the community employment programme will be mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for the services in question. Services in the schools sector are being prioritised at present in this regard.</P>
      <P>Mainstreaming will take place on a phased basis having regard to the suitability for mainstreaming of the service being provided and with due regard to an individual's participation entitlements on CE. Mainstreaming should enhance the services being provided and provide valuable employment opportunities. I intend to initiate the mainstreaming process by transferring CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to the Department of Education and Science in time for the new school year beginning in September next. It is intended under the mainstreaming process that all schools, including those who have never benefited from CE funding, will receive additional funding. During a transition period, some schools will receive the additional funding from the Department of Education and Science while still benefiting from the services of CE participants, as CE incumbents who opt to serve out their contracts will be facilitated in doing so.</P>

However, the Competition Authority recently announced a consultation process for a study of competition in a number of professions under the competition Acts and it has sought views and comment on the intended scope of the study. The authority has stated that it intends to study a range of restrictions such as barriers to entry, restraints on behaviour, and bans on advertising or seeking new business, that are common across several professions and that are supported within a statutory or regulatory framework. The restrictions on competition will be the primary focus and the authority has yet to decide on the terms of reference and the sectors for inclusion in the study.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Competition Authority has made comments about regulation in the pharmacy sector and many other sectors, it has not proposed to examine the pharmacy business. However, the Deputy may be aware of the recent announcement by the Competition Authority of a consultation process for a study of competition in a number of professions under the competition Acts and the fact that it has sought views and comment on the intended scope of the study. The authority has stated that it intends to study a <Col N="193" /> range of restrictions, such as barriers to entry, restraints on behaviour, and bans on advertising or seeking new business that are common across several professions and that are supported within a statutory or regulatory framework. The restrictions on competition will be the primary focus and the authority has yet to decide on the terms of reference and the sectors for inclusion in the study.</P>
    <P>As regards consolidation of pharmaceutical outlets, any proposed merger or acquisition where the parties concerned exceed the financial thresholds specified in the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, must be notified to me in advance for regulatory clearance. These financial thresholds relate to turnover of at least IR£20 million, or gross assets of at least IR£10 million. Where I receive a notification under merger law, I can refer it to the Competition Authority for investigation before deciding whether to either clear it, conditionally or unconditionally, or prohibit it in the common good.</P>

      <P>I have contacted the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to the Deputy's question, in view of the director's responsibility for the licensing of moneylenders under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>According to the director's office, the firm mentioned by the Deputy is not licensed and has never held a licence under Part VIII of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, from the director to engage in the business of moneylending. Her office has no knowledge whatsoever of the firm under either of the names indicated by the Deputy or of the person said to be the owner by the Deputy. This is probably not surprising, given the Deputy's statement that the firm closed in 1993, three years before the commencement of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, in May 1996.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs that the Companies Registration Office has no record of any registration in the more recent name of the firm as indicated by the Deputy, but does have records in relation to the earlier name indicated by him. From these records it will be seen that the firm was first incorporated in August 1931, it last filed annual returns in March 1997 and its last registered address was the same address as that of the person on whose behalf the Deputy is making representations. From the records it would also appear that that firm has been dissolved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and I have been following very closely developments in relation to Independent Insurance Company Limited (IICL), a UK insurer which went into voluntary liquidation on 18 June last, with particular focus on the immediate implications for Irish policyholders and claimants. We are also concerned at the broader implications for the effective operation of the European Single Market in insurance. Contact is being maintained with the UK authorities and <Col N="195" /> with the EU Commission, as well as with the provisional liquidators, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Irish Brokers' Association.</P>
    <P>Under the rules of the European Single Market, responsibility for financial supervision of the company's operations throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) lies with the UK authorities. The main objective of the EU system of financial supervision of insurance companies is to protect policyholders while giving them access to insurance cover from supervised companies in all EEA member states.</P>
    <P>The treatment of policyholders as creditors of a failed insurer is determined by the laws of the home member state, in this case the United Kingdom. UK insolvency law treats all policyholders as unsecured creditors. It will not be clear for some time the extent to which the liquidators of IICL will be able to meet claims from the creditors of IICL, including policyholders. It appears likely that claims will not be met in full.</P>
    <P>The UK Policyholder Protection Act provides, subject to certain limitations, that compensation be paid to individual policyholders in the event of a company failure. Corporate policyholders are compensated only in respect of compulsory insurance. Our officials are seeking to clarify whether any policies issued to Irish policyholders will meet the qualifying criteria for protection.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. Opportunities in an increasingly positive labour market environment for CE participants who have completed their term on the programme to obtain permanent employment are influenced by <Col N="196" /> location, education and the skill level of the participants.</P>
      <P>There are currently in the region of 33,500 participants on CE, of whom 10,520 are over 50 years of age. Participants can remain on the programme for a period of one to three years depending on their age and unemployment status. The maximum duration on CE for all participants is three years with the exception of offshore Island inhabitants and participants on drugs taskforce projects.</P>
      <P>My Department is finalising proposals for a high supports process, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will enhance the range of options available for job seekers with employment barriers, including older persons on CE who have limited employment opportunities in the open labour market. Further consultations with the social partners on the high supports process are due to take place shortly and I would hope that this process can be put in place at an early date.</P>
      <P>My Department is also considering with FÁS the issue of older persons, workers in rural areas and others who have previously participated on CE, and who are having difficulty progressing to open employment. This issue will be also considered in the context of developing policy for the high supports process, and in the light of the implications of both elements for the future operation of CE following the mainstreaming of essential services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 143, 144 and 146 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised by the Deputies are day to day matters for Enterprise Ireland. I was pleased to attend the Into the Regions event, which took place on 14 June 2001 and was aimed at Dublin <Col N="198" /> based companies and institutions which are considering or might be prepared to consider locating an expansion project in the regions. The purpose of the event was to promote awareness of the regions and of Enterprise Ireland's ability to provide an all-in-one information and support service to companies in this area, as well as to outline the various ways in which Enterprise Ireland, working with its various partners, can help.</P>
    <P>Feedback to date on the event has been positive. One hundred Dublin based companies visited the showcase and a significant number of others who could not attend on the day have asked to be included in the follow-up activity. Already a number of encouraging leads have been identified and Enterprise Ireland is in dialogue with these companies. Over the coming months, Enterprise Ireland will be endeavouring to convert these leads into regional projects. However, as this is a medium term process, it will not be possible to establish its ultimate success for a period of 12 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>Donegal and Kildare were represented on the north west and mid-east regional stands respectively, which handled a number of inquiries, but at this stage it is premature to speculate as to whether any of those companies will ultimately choose Donegal or South Kildare for their expansion plans.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland's approach to drive economic growth in the regions is set out in its document, Driving Growth in Regional Enterprise, which I launched in February of this year. This is founded on four distinct pillars, the fourth of which aims to identify new opportunities for economic development in the regions, including investments by expansion-minded Dublin based companies. The initiative is based on expansion opportunities and not relocations of Dublin firms in their totality to regional locations. </P>
    <P>It is intended in the meantime to keep this option firmly on the agenda for Dublin based companies, and all interested companies will be actively followed up.</P>

      <P>Data in respect of the enterprise development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Udarás na Gaeltachta, and the county enterprise boards &ndash; show that, in the period 1996 to 2000, there were 1,052 net full-time and part-time job gains in the north-west region comprising counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo. The CSO labour force survey and quarterly national household survey show that total numbers at work in the Border, midlands and west &ndash; BMW &ndash; region increased from 351,000 in April 1997 to 424,000 in November <Col N="199" /> 2000, an increase of more than 20%. During the same period, the unemployment rate in the BMW region more than halved, from 10.5% to 4.8%.</P>
      <P>The down sizing of the Fruit of the Loom operations in County Donegal has had a significant impact on the region's performance. My Department and its agencies have been active in efforts to counteract this development, and since November 2000 I have announced almost 800 new jobs for Donegal, culminating in the announcement just last week by Prumerica Systems of a 450 job expansion at their Letterkenny facility. The Inishowen peninsula has also benefited, with indigenous companies Atlanfish, Carndonagh, Moville Clothing, and Iontas, also in Moville, announcing over 200 new jobs recently. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has provided funding to the Moville Community Enterprise Centre, which is planning to develop 10,000 square feet of small flexible enterprise units in the town, specifically designed for start-up and expanding businesses.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has also been active in Inishowen. The former Fruit of the Loom factory at Malin has been sold to Donegal County Council to facilitate the establishment of an operation by Forward Emphasis, while the agency is also marketing the vacant Fruit of the Loom facilities at Buncrana, Milford and Raphoe. Recent announcements of internationally mobile investment include Sterling Fluid Systems and Kirchhoff Ireland, both in Letterkenny, and Claddagh Resources in Lisfannon.</P>
      <P>Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have recently announced enhanced regional strategies which will lead to an increased focus on the needs of the regions. The Enterprise Ireland approach aims to enhance the operating environment for firms outside Dublin and to encourage investments in regional locations by Dublin based companies. This has led to six Dublin companies expanding into County Donegal, including Forward Emphasis, Eland Technology, Network 365, Go-Ireland, The Bromley Group, and International Test Technologies. IDA Ireland has re-established its Letterkenny office and regional staff have been recruited, a move designed to stimulate growth within the region. The development of Letterkenny Business Park has been completed with Pacificare now employing 180 people in unit 1, and work has also commenced on a business park for Ballyshannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenge of achieving balanced regional development is a multifaceted one which is addressed in many aspects of the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006. These policies, which focus particularly on infrastructure development, human resource development and the stimulation of productive investment by the private sector, are being implemented across a range of Departments. Notable features affecting the north-west are improvements to the main roads serving the area and the securing a daily Derry-Dublin air service last January. The <Col N="200" /> Government recognises the need for a world-class electricity, gas and telecommunications infrastructure to foster continued enterprise development in the region, and is pushing ahead with a number of key capital programmes to enhance services to the north-west and between the region and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Motor insurance premia are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me or our Department from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels, or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite. The formation of the EU Single Market for insurance in 1994 granted access to the Irish motor insurance market to all authorised insurance companies within the EU. This encourages as many insurers as possible to compete on the Irish market, so that the Irish consumer is getting the most competitive quotes from the insurance companies availing of the opportunity to compete on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which I established in 1998, is aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. The board's final report is expected by the end of this year and in the light of the recommendations of the board, the Government and I will consider what further action is appropriate and necessary in order to reduce the cost of motor insurance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently decided to proceed with the main recommendation of the report of the Special Working Group on Personal Injury Compensation. The proposal is to establish on a statutory basis a personal injuries assessment board, which will commence its first stage early in 2002, with an initial mandate to address personal injury claims arising from employers' liability insurance and later those relating to motor accidents.</P>

Job losses in agency supported firms over the same period totalled 6,856. While the latter figure excludes job losses in county enterprise board firms, the extent of such losses is not significant.</P>
      <P>However, these figures do not reveal the full employment picture.

      <P>The use of advanced information communications technologies &ndash; ICTs &ndash; has become the most significant driver of world economic growth. ICTs are the catalysts through which enterprise, whether traditional or new and irrespective of location can create sustained competitive advantage for its products and services on world markets. ICTs are also the catalysts through which enterprise can create quality and sustainable employment. Innovative strategies that capitalise on the power of the Internet are required and new business models that respond to customer demands in the knowledge economy must be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> The objectives through which my Department is helping Irish enterprise to meet the technological, competitiveness and strategic challenges, and exploit the opportunities posed by the new ICTs, are contained in the Departments Strategy Statement, 2001-03. Initiatives aimed at promoting e-commerce are a day-to-day matter for the agencies. Such schemes are aimed principally at SMEs throughout Ireland, including the BMW region. Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards have developed e-business initiatives as part of their key role in developing e-business strategies for Irish SMEs.</P>
    <P>The Enterprise Ireland £10 million (12.7 million) e-business acceleration fund, launched in March 2000 is designed to fast track significant scale projects so that Irish businesses adopt advanced information and communication technologies to operate in a fully integrated manner thus enhancing their competitive advantage. Some 102 projects were approved across a wide range of industry sectors in companies throughout Ireland with funding of up to £250,000 per company. Some 33 of the companies, one third of the total approved, are located in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>In July 2000, the 35 city and county enterprise boards launched EMPOWER, a fast-track e-commerce project for small businesses with funding of £3 million (3.809 million). The objective is to assist and mentor small businesses to effectively and efficiently increase their connectivity to the worldwide web in order to enhance their competitiveness. All the boards devised individual plans tailored to the specific needs of their small business client base and each board was allocated funding based on these plans. Some £957,000 (1.215 million) has been allocated to the 13 boards in the Border, midlands and west region.</P>
    <P>In addition to the agency initiatives, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland have commenced an SME e-business programme which has provided for the employment of three e-business development executives by the chambers in the Border, midlands and west region. The programme is aimed at owner managers and focuses on developing practical skills and a cost-effective e-business strategy. It is estimated by CCI that some 1,500 businesses in the BMW region will receive training by December 2002. The executives will work directly with small and medium sized businesses to develop an e-business strategy.</P>

      <P>The Insurance Bill was discussed at length during the last year and a half with the various interest groups involved, including the Professional Insurance Brokers Association. It was signed into law on 20 December 2000, becoming the Insurance Act, 2000. A commencement order was subsequently made bringing into effect various sections of the Act. The part which amended the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, to allow for the transfer of regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank came into effect on 1 April 2001. I understand that the Central Bank issued consultation documents and engaged in intensive consultations with the insurance brokers associations in relation to the bank's taking up of regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries.</P>
      <P>While the regulation of insurance intermediaries is now strictly a matter for the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, I recently chaired a meeting, attended by representatives of the insurance brokers associations and other interested parties, held in the context of further consultations being undertaken by the Central Bank. This meeting was a very valuable contribution to the process of consultation undertaken by the Central Bank. I understand the bank is now finalising the codes of practice, having made significant changes to them, based on the views expressed by the interested parties.</P>

      <P>The Kilkenny community action network's Youthstart project was approved for ESF funding on 22 January 1998 and carried out its activities until the end of March 2000. The project was allocated 467,477 ECU (approximately £350,608) from the European Social Fund, for which additional match funding of 25% was secured from FÁS, the South-Eastern Health Board, Ossory Youth Services, Kilkenny city vocational school and the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> Delays from time to time in releasing ESF funds by the EU Commission have resulted in cash flow difficulties being encountered by some projects. The situation is also hindered by the method of retrospective verification and certification of ESF expenditure and regulations. The internal audit unit of my Department must also be satisfied that procedures have been complied with relating to closure of the entire programme before a final claim can be sent to the Commission. This process is currently under way.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has agreed to allow my Department to establish a special Exchequer suspense account in order to pre-finance projects until procedures concerning final claim submission have been complied with to the satisfaction of the Commission and ESF moneys became available. As a result it proved possible to part pay, from Exchequer funds, claims from all eligible projects, including Kilkenny community action network. Of the original commitment of 467,477 ECU (£350,608) to this project, a final sum amounting to 26,498 (£20,868) which is equivalent to 50% of their final payment remains to be paid from the ESF.</P>
    <P>The budgetary situation is being examined by my officials with a view to accessing additional funding in order to complete the process of project closure as quickly as possible. However, claims in respect of bank interest are not eligible under ESF eligibility rules and regulations.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is particularly interested in former lead, zinc and copper mines. Under the Minerals Development Acts, which embody the current policy in relation to minerals, I seek to maximise the interest in exploring for minerals and to further the exploitation of economic ore bodies where they are found subject to the various permits under the Acts. These include prospecting licences, State mining leases and State mining licences. They allow me to convey to interested parties, who have demonstrated their bona fides and capability, the authority to exploit what is a State resource subject to an equitable sharing of the fruits of that effort between the State and the permit holder.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155, 156, 160 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 12 June 2001 to Question No. 158 in which I outlined circumstances and procedures relating to the compulsory acquisition of land or ancillary rights over land for the purpose of petroleum exploitation. The power of compulsory acquisition of land or ancillary rights is vested in the Minister and not in any private company and the provisions for such are set out in sections 23 to 26 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the company referred to by the Deputy is currently conducting negotiations about the acquisition of wayleaves with landowners in the north Mayo area. The company has indicated that there are a number of cases where it is unlikely that they will receive consent and have consequently indicated that they may require compulsory acquisition procedures. If the company wishes to pursue the matter of compulsory acquisition of an ancillary right &ndash; wayleave &ndash; in that instance then it will be a matter for the company to formally apply to me for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the position arise that I am of the opinion that it is necessary for the efficient or convenient exploitation of petroleum to acquire any ancillary right then I will give consideration to compulsory acquisition. Communications <Col N="207" /> between the company and landowners in Rossport, County Mayo, are a matter for the company itself and I have no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am currently pursuing the question of the transfer of certain functions in relation to upstream pipelines under the Gas Act, 1976, from the Minister for Public Enterprise to myself. These functions relate to the construction, maintenance and repair of upstream pipelines including environmental impact assessment provisions and also include powers and functions relating to compulsory acquisition orders.</P>
    <P>Section 32 of the Gas Act, 1976, as amended by the Gas (Amendment) Act, 2000, deals with compulsory acquisition orders under this section. A person who has obtained the consent of the appropriate Minister to construct a gas pipeline may in accordance with section 8 of the Gas Act apply under section 32 of the Act as amended by Section 20(5) of the Gas (Amendment) Act, 2000, for an acquisition order to acquire compulsorily any land or right over land which is required for the construction of the gas pipeline.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule of the Gas Act sets out procedures associated with compulsory acquisition orders. In summary these require the applicant to: submit a draft of the order applied for; submit plans, specifications and other documents showing the situation of the land to which the order sought is to apply including the stretch of land or corridor over which it is proposed to construct the pipeline including the limits within which the applicant may consider it necessary to construct outside the &ldquo;corridor&rdquo; of the pipeline; submit a statement of the nature of the estate or interest in such right over land which the applicant seeks to acquire by virtue of the order; keep deposited at places appointed by the Minister, for such periods as the Minister may direct, copies of the documentation relating to the application and publish in such newspaper(s) as the Minister may direct notice of the application indicating,<i> inter alia</i>, that objections and representations may be made in writing to her about the application, specifying the period during which such representations/objections may be inspected.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the Second Schedule provides that in cases of dispute as to the amount of compensation payable the Minister may direct that an oral hearing be conducted and every person who makes an objection or representation relating to the application is entitled to appear and be heard at the hearing. When the procedures relating to requirements of Article 7 of the Second Schedule have been complied with the Minister may grant an acquisition order in whole or in part and subject to any variations or amendments to the application as appropriate.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, £20 million has been allocated to marine tourism, and targeted particularly at improving marine access infrastructure such as marinas, berths and slipways. The scheme will be part of the two regional operational programmes and the funding has been allocated £6 million for the south and east region and £14 million for the Border, midland and western region. It is intended that the activities eligible for funding under the scheme will include feasibility studies for marine access infrastructure projects. The scheme, however, is not expected to be in place until later this summer and applications cannot be accepted before it is formally launched and applications invited.</P>
      <P>On a recent visit to Ballina, County Mayo, I was made aware of a number of development proposals for the harbour area, among which was a proposal for a new marina. However, this project cannot yet be considered as being a formal application as my Department's marine tourism grant scheme is not yet in place.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that all parties who have expressed an interest in the scheme, including those in Ballina, will be sent details and an application form as soon as they are available. Once the formal scheme is in place and a formal application received from the promoters of the Ballina project, it will be assessed in accordance with the procedures laid down under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that measures by my Department building on the potential of Donegal's marine sector are ongoing, including the extension to the National Fisheries Training Centre at Greencastle has been completed at a cost of £974,000, including State investment. Funding was allocated for investment of over £5 million in harbour developments in County Donegal in 2000 and a further £6.6 million has been allocated this year. The development of new berthage facilities at Killybegs is progressing with investment estimated in the order of £35 million. Since March 1999, aquaculture licences have been granted for shellfish operations in north County Donegal, mostly in Lough Swilly, with the prospect of creating about 100 jobs over three to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aquaculture licences have also been granted for the expansion of salmon farming operations in Mulroy Bay at Glinsk and in Lough Swilly at Binnaweelmore and Callagh. During 2000, four fishing vessels from County Donegal participated <Col N="210" /> in deepwater fishing trials receiving total current funding of £196,000 approximately and capital funding of £67,000 approximately. In 2001, further deep water trials involved six vessels from Donegal receiving current funding of £581,000 and capital of £195,000. Five other Donegal fishing vessels received capital funding of £50,000 approximately for gear associated with technical conservation work and other gear technology initiatives during 2000.</P>
    <P>A further two vessels have, to date, received £24,000 approx. for similar projects in 2001. In addition, during 2000 and 2001, as a result of State funded fishing technology projects ancillary industries in County Donegal, including gear manufacturers, ships chandlers and marine electronics firms received approximately £900,000.</P>
    <P>Vessel projects approved in 1999-2000 for Donegal were as follows:</P>

    <P>Further to the Marine Institute report entitled, A Framework for the Development of Tourism and Leisure in the Marine and Inland Waterways of County Donegal, the Donegal County Development Board has recently set up a marine development leisure forum. A co-ordinator for this forum has also been employed for a three year period starting in January 2001. The co-ordinator, advised by the forum and operating under the auspices of Donegal County Development Board, will work to implement the measures recommended in the Marine Institute report and to ensure that the sector is developed to its greatest possible potential in County Donegal. This post is being jointly funded by the Northern Regional Fisheries Board, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Donegal County Council and the Marine Institute.</P>

      <P>The EU multi-annual guidance programme for Ireland covering the period to 2001 prescribes the maximum permissible capacity, in terms of tonnage and engine power, for the Irish fishing fleet. To ensure compliance with these <Col N="212" /> limits, fishing vessel licensing policy requires a licence applicant to remove from the sea fishing boat register tonnage and engine power equal to that of the vessel to be licensed.</P>
      <P>If a licence applicant wishes his or her vessel to be permitted to fish for herring and mackerel, the capacity removed from the sea fishing boat register must have an active history of fishing for these pelagic species. For these purposes, an active history is defined as a minimum of four months fishing for those species in each of the last four years.</P>
      <P>The capacity removed from the register by the individual concerned does not, according to my Department's records, have a full active history. In the circumstances, the vessel must be precluded from fishing for herring and mackerel.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me that this criterion may be excessively onerous and that this is posing difficulties for fishermen who wish to acquire active pelagic capacity in fulfilment of licensing requirements. The scope for change to the existing requirements and the implications of any change is under review in consultation with fishermen's representative organisations.</P>

As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be proper at this time to discuss this matter further until the investigation is complete and the inspectors have made their report to me.

      <Col N="213" /> All sea-going vessels are required to comply with the international regulations for preventing collision at sea which are in effect the &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; for the sea. Furthermore, my Department's marine safety working group is continuing to promote maritime safety awareness. This working group devises and communicates safety information and guidelines through safety campaigns and the publication and dissemination of posters and booklets. The Irish Sailing Association is represented on the group and it circulates the group's publications to its affiliated clubs and to recognised teaching establishments. The group organised the year 2000 safety on the water campaign which had the aim of getting the safety message to as many water users as possible and this year the group is hoping its follow-up campaign will reach an even wider audience.</P>

The first phase of the marina, which I recently opened, slightly exceeds the area allowed under the terms of the foreshore lease issued by my Department following approval by me. I am satisfied that this was not intentional and that it does not interfere with navigation or cause environmental problems. It is, therefore, purely a landlord and tenant issue and my Department has put certain proposals to the harbour company to deal with the matter and regularise the situation.</P>

      <P>Colin Port, Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk, was appointed to lead the investigation into her murder, which is still ongoing. In the past three weeks, the Port team has arrested seven people in the course of its investigation of Rosemary Nelson's murder. Although a number of those arrested have been charged with other offences, to date none has been charged in connection with Rosemary Nelson's murder.

      <P>Recognising that the case raises wider issues of concern to her family, to the public and to the international community, the Taoiseach has called for the establishment of a public inquiry into the murder. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy, has also called for a judicial commission of inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson, a call that the Government has welcomed.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department remain in close contact with the British authorities in relation to the investigation.

      <Col N="217" /> Robert Hamill died on 8 May 1997, following an attack in Portadown. Eyewitnesses have claimed that RUC officers in the vicinity at the time failed to intervene. In calling for a public inquiry into the death of Robert Hamill, on 8 June 2000, the Taoiseach stated that the case was of urgent public interest and that the issues of concern must be resolved in a manner which would command the confidence of the community.</P>
    <P>On 24 November 2000, the Police Ombudsman took over direct and active supervision of the police disciplinary investigation. She said that she would &ldquo;dedicate all the necessary resources to ensure that all avenues are investigated, exposed and exploited&rdquo; in this &ldquo;very sensitive&rdquo; case. On 10 April last, the Ombudsman announced that seven people had been arrested in connection with her investigation. They were released without charge on police bail shortly afterwards. The family issued a statement, welcoming the arrests but repeating their call for a public inquiry. The Government continues to monitor developments in Mr. Hamill's case closely and to pursue its concerns actively with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The murder of Sean Brown, a highly respected member of his community, was a heinous crime. Like the Deputy and the victim's family, I want to see the perpetrators brought to justice. I understand that while seven persons were arrested following the murder, no one was charged in relation to it. The murder inquiry is still ongoing but I understand that there have been no recent developments.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have been in contact with Sean Brown's family, who have concerns about the conduct of the police investigation as well as the conduct of the inquest. On 20 March, the family lodged an official complaint with the Police Ombudsman. The ECtHR ruling of 4 May which dealt with,<i> inter alia</i>, the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland, will also impact on the conduct of the inquest into Mr. Brown's death. On 7 June, the Coroner for Greater Belfast, Mr. John Leckey, held a hearing both on the general issue of the conduct of inquests following the ECtHR ruling and specifically on the inquest into Mr. Brown's death and a number of others. The hearing was adjourned until 4 September, pending the British Government's decision on appealing the ECtHR ruling. We continue to monitor this and other aspects of this case and to raise our concerns with the British authorities through the mechanism of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat.</P>

      <P>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in variable amounts in rocks and soil. When it surfaces in the open air, it is quickly diluted. However, where it enters an enclosed space, such as a house, it can reach unacceptably high concentration levels.</P>
      <P>There is evidence to suggest that long-term exposure to high levels of radon can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer.</P>
      <P>Over the years the Government has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of radon problems throughout the country and in highlighting public awareness of radon. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, carried out a national survey on radon in domestic dwellings which allowed the identification of high radon areas &ndash; areas where high radon concentration are most prevalent. Along with the RPII, I have actively encouraged householders in those areas designated as high radon areas and who have not had their homes measured for radon levels to do so.</P>
      <P>The RPII is currently undertaking a national survey of radon in schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>A booklet entitled &ldquo;Radon in Buildings&rdquo; produced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government provides advice to householders and builders on preventative and remedial measures which can be undertaken in new and existing buildings to reduce high radon concentrations.</P>
      <P>In May 2000, I signed an order which provides for the implementation of Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation. This legislation, which came into effect on 13 May 2000, applies to all work activities affected by radiation exposure including workplaces where radon is a problem. The RPII will undertake an investigation of radon in workplaces later this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the radon remediation grant scheme for domestic dwellings, approved by Government in September 2000, is due to commence in the second half of this year. A financial allocation has been included in my Department's Vote in respect of the scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 9 of 10 May 2001 regarding the scheme. I am confident that the scheme will encourage householders with high radon concentration levels in their homes to undertake the appropriate remediation works. The publicity surrounding the launch of the scheme will heighten public awareness of the dangers of radon gas.</P>

      <P>The development of major natural gas pipelines usually takes about three years from conception to completion. Bord Gáis Éireann began work on developing the extension to the west some two years ago and it is scheduled for completion next year. The Deputy will be aware that the Government decision on extending the gas network to the north-west was made earlier this year and will appreciate that the development plans are at an early stage.</P>
      <P>Last week my Department received a copy of a report commissioned by Bord Gáis Éireann on the possible routes of an extension of the natural gas network to the north west. The report makes clear that none of the possible route options would be commercial in its own right and that some form of assistance, either in the form of grant aid or an increase in the gas transmission tariff would be required to offset the viability deficit. I have made it clear on previous occasions that I do not favour assisting the development of uncommercial extensions to the gas network by means of an increase in the transmission tariff. This would place the burden on existing gas consumers and would have a detrimental effect on national competitiveness. My strong preference is for such uncommercial extensions to be considered on the basis of funding being made available in an open and transparent way.</P>
      <P>My Department will examine the report commissioned by BGÉ in the context of the wider regional development, economic and environment benefits of bringing gas to the north west, the levels of grant aid associated with the various route options and the implications of the EU State aid requirements.</P>
      <P>In considering the question of extending the gas network to the north-west, I am looking closely at developments in Northern Ireland. BGÉ and Questar have made an application to the Northern Ireland authorities for the construction of two pipelines, one from Belfast to Derry and another from Gormanston to Belfast. This opens up the possibility of getting gas to the north west from Northern Ireland and this option is being examined along with the other options for extending the network to the north west as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by Iarnród Éireann that fares are charged on a zonal basis on the suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area. This system has been the practice since the early 1970s. I understand that, based on this long standing practice, the fare to Bray is in Zone J while Greystones is in Zone E.</P>

      <P>The consultation paper entitled &ldquo;A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport&rdquo; was published by the Government in September 2000. It sets out a number of proposals in relation to the restructuring of the CIE companies. These proposals are currently the subject of consultation with the Public Transport Partnership Forum which was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Before responding to the Government's consultation paper, the forum has commissioned an independent consultant to carry out a comparative evaluation of the provision, regulation and integration of public transport in nine selected cities throughout the world. I understand that this consultancy is nearing completion. I will await the forum's response before finalising my proposals for Government in this area.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department is continuing to carry out background work on institutional reform issues. Following consultation with the forum, my Department is currently considering tenders from consultants to carry out a research study into the financial and other implications of the restructuring of the CIE group of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to address the many issues facing Iarnród Éireann in delivering the ambitious targets contained in the national development plan a small top level group was appointed earlier this year and will assist Iarnród Éireann to face the challenges of expanding the rail network and delivering improved services to customers. The group is investigating the current industrial relations environment within the company and the challenges facing management, staff and unions to achieve maximum value for the customer and the taxpayer from the major investment programme in the rail system over the com<Col N="221" /> ing years. The group is also examining the current structures, procedures, processes and practices within the company at all levels for managing the changes necessary.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to bring forward proposals for regulatory reform of the bus markets outside the greater Dublin area before the end of this year. My Department has commenced the process of recruiting consultants to carry out a study in relation to options for regulatory reform. Interested parties will shortly be invited to make submissions, which will be taken into account by the consultants in the course of the study.</P>

      <P>MediaLabEurope, MLE, the third level research and development educational facility established in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is the subject of formal agreements between the Government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, and MediaLabEurope.</P>
      <P>The Government, for its part, has agreed funding of IR£28 million over four years plus the cost of a suitable premises which will be let to MLE at a nominal rent. In return, MIT/MLE have agreed commitments in regard to the following: involvement of MIT personnel; attraction of high calibre research projects, researchers and students to MediaLabEurope; recognition of time spent in MediaLabEurope, by Irish and foreign students for degree granting purposes; achievement of sponsorship targets and financial reporting. A reporting framework has been put in place to ensure that commitments agreed are adhered to.</P>
      <P>The Government also approved IR£1 million per annum over seven years to fund collaborative research projects between MLE and the Irish universities. The funding is being managed by the Higher Education Authority and a reporting framework in regard to this expenditure has been put in place.</P>
      <P>In April of this year, the Government approved funding for the Digital Hub project. A total of IR£61 million has been allocated in capital funding for property purchase, including purchase of a premises for MediaLabEurope, with IR£42 million to be spent this year and the balance, that is, IR£19 million arising next year. Property purchase is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works and the property will be vested in the State.</P>

    <P>Digital Media Development Limited, DMDL, the company mandated to develop the hub has <Col N="222" /> been allocated IR£2 million per annum in operating expenses for the period 2001 to 2003.</P>

      <P>MediaLab Europe, MLE, is an educational research facility with an international focus. The Government funding commitment to MediaLab Europe represents start-up capital. Eventually, it is envisaged that MLE will be primarily funded by commercial sponsorship. Therefore, if it is to compete with other research facilities around the world for sponsorship, high calibre researchers and projects, it is vital that senior staff and board members have international reputations.</P>
      <P>The agreement between the Government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology specifically provides for a transfer of knowledge from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MediaLab to MLE, particularly in the start-up phase of the project. One of the main channels for the transfer of this knowledge is the involvement of senior MITML staff in MLE.</P>
      <P>Recruitment of research scientists to MLE is based on academic and research excellence. Suitably qualified Irish researchers have the same opportunities to apply for positions at MLE as researchers of other nationalities. The initial staffing intake includes Irish, European and US researchers.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives that seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, 26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects that rolled out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion. A number of these projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the north-west. Esat Telecom was supported in the roll-out of fibre optic cable in urban areas, including Letterkenny. Eircom was allocated funding for the installation of a 95 km high capacity fibre optic cable along the west coast of Donegal, from Bunbeg to Donegal town and from Dunfanaghy to Falcarragh, serving all communities along the route.</P>
      <P>The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased, to 200 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. A first call for proposals was run last year and, on foot of submissions received, I signed nine contracts at the beginning of the year, which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail an overall investment of 160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately 55 million. Among these projects, Donegal will benefit from the building of the ESB fibre optic network and the construction of a broadband communications corridor by Chorus from Mayo through Sligo and into Donegal. Additional details of these projects are available at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie.</P>

Bord Gáis Éireann, BGÉ, has commissioned a report on the commercial viability of extending the gas network to the north-west, including Donegal.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, on the advice of the Government, the individual concerned was retired, by the President, with effect from a date in June 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954, and paragraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;. In my reply to the Deputy in October 1997, the extract from Defence Force Regulations A.15 quoted, incorporated amendment No. 93, which was effected on 14 February 1985. However, in any event, the precise relevance, if indeed any, of the terms of <Col N="227" /> the 1985 amendment referred to is not clear as regards the specifics of this particular case.</P>
      <P>A decision to retire an officer &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; is only taken for the most compelling reasons. Given that the Government decision and advice to the President concerned military security, I am not in a position to comment in further detail. However, I can say that I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner and that the decision taken was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the person concerned would have been fully aware at the time of the circumstances giving rise to his retirement in June 1969. He had been previously interviewed by officers of the intelligence section of the Army on three separate occasions in April 1969 in relation to a number of serious matters that had come to their attention.</P>
      <P>At the third of these interviews, the person in question volunteered to submit a statement in relation to the matters raised, but did not do so. Given the serious nature of the situation presented to the military authorities, they were of the opinion that to retain the person in service would be contrary to the interests of the Defence Forces and the State.</P>
      <P>The Deputy Judge Advocate General was requested to advise on the matter and he conducted a personal interview with the officer concerned in May 1969. The Deputy Judge Advocate General informed the officer that he had been asked to advise the general staff regarding the case and that he wished to give the officer concerned an opportunity to submit any statement he wished to make in relation to the issues raised in the April interviews. The officer advised the Deputy Judge Advocate General that, following the April interviews, he had consulted a solicitor who undertook to correspond with the military authorities on his behalf. The Deputy Judge Advocate General informed him that no such correspondence had been received.</P>
      <P>The Deputy Judge Advocate General took the officer through the issues raised in the April interviews, explained the gravity of the situation, advised him to consider the situation, and arranged a further meeting for the following day, at which the officer was to submit a statement. The officer raised the question as to whether he could consult his solicitor and the Deputy Judge Advocate General made it clear to the officer that there was no objection to such a course of action. When the officer returned the following day, he then advised the Deputy Judge Advocate General that he would not in fact be making any statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of access to files, the person in question applied to the military authorities in May 1998 under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, for access to copies of all documents in relation to his retirement from the Permanent Defence Force and in <Col N="228" /> relation to his period of service in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The military authorities issued their decision on the application on 12 June 1998. They advised him that the records sought did not come within the scope of relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, except in so far as the request related to &ldquo;personal information&rdquo;, as provided for in the Act. In this regard, he was advised that he could have access to all personal information contained in his file for the period in question and could photocopy the documents to which access had been granted.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the individual, through his legal representatives, exercised his right to appeal the decision to the designated freedom of information internal appeals officer in the Defence Forces. The appeal was considered by the relevant officer, who decided to uphold the initial decision. This decision was issued in writing to the applicant's legal representatives on 20 July 1998. Copies of the records which were deemed by the military decision makers to come within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act were forwarded to the then legal representatives of the person in question in July 1998. When conveying his decision in relation to the internal review of the decision, the internal appeals officer advised the applicant of his statutory right of further appeal to the information commissioner. The information commissioner functions as an independent officer with statutory powers to review decisions made by public bodies in relation to freedom of information applications. I understand that, in July 1998, such an appeal was lodged with the office of the information commissioner, as such appeals concern that office. However, I understand from inquiries to that office that the case was suspended in July 1998 at the request of the applicant's then legal representatives, and was subsequently discontinued by the information Commissioners office in 1999 due to the non-pursuance of the matter by the individual concerned and his legal representatives at that time.</P>

      <P>This question refers to the issue of having military service allowance, MSA, included in the calculation of pensions of Defence Forces' personnel who retired before 1 August 1990. I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 19 on 21 June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At current rates, the immediate cost to my Department of extending the benefit of MSA to pre-August 1990 pensioners &ndash; of whom there are some 4,500 &ndash; is estimated at £5 million a year. <Col N="229" /> There would also be cost repercussions in other areas of the public service. In this regard, the commission on public service pensions indicated in its final report, which was published in January 2001, that it had obtained actuarial advice on the impact of making certain allowances, including MSA, pensionable in the specific cases of Garda and Defence Forces' pensioners for future pension payments only. The Commission was advised that, at 1997 costs, this would result in an immediate increase in expenditure of £9 million per year and that the accrued liabilities of the State would increase by £116 million if this change were implemented for both groups. The commission, having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for those groups.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission has recently presented its proposals for reform of the sheepmeat regime. The main element in these proposals is that the current variable ewe premium should be replaced by a fixed premium of 21. Discussions on these proposals have just commenced in the Council and it will be some months before they are concluded. In any event the proposal will apply from 2002 only and it will not be possible to pay the revised premium until the measure has been brought into effect. As regards the 2001 ewe premium it is expected that payment of the first instalment can commence towards the middle of July. It should be pointed out that sheep producers have received a welcome boost to their incomes this year as a result of increased prices at abattoirs which to date have been approximately 30% above last year's levels.</P>

      <P>The national sheep identification system came into operation on 21 June. From that date all sheep must be tagged on movement off farm with a tag bearing the flock number of the farm and an individual number. All sheep remaining on farms must be tagged at the latest by 15 December.</P>
      <P>The tag numbers are issued centrally by my Department and tags are supplied by commercial operators. Eight tag suppliers have been approved to supply tags to farmers. This allows farmers a wide choice as to the type of tag they wish to use. Commercial competition has also ensured that tags are available at a reasonable price. The approved suppliers have now processed over 2.2 million tags and I am confident that the demand for tags can be met in full within a reasonable timeframe. These suppliers have been processing tags since the system went live on 25 May and they have a capacity to produce up to 230,000 tags a day. Some companies have prioritised the processing of the short-term tag which can only be used for movement directly to slaughter. This measure has considerably reduced the delay in issuing tags to farmers by three to four days.</P>

      <P>The national sheep identification system came into operation on 21 June. From that date all sheep must be tagged on movement off farm with a tag bearing the flock number of the farm and an individual number. All sheep remaining on farms must be tagged at the latest by 15 December. Ireland thus has, for the first time, full traceability for all sheep on an individual animal basis. This will be of significant benefit, most notably, in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Sheepmeat Forum which reported in October 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approved suppliers have now processed over 2.2 million tags and I am confident that the demand for tags can be met in full within a reasonable timeframe. These suppliers have been processing tags since the system went live on 25 May and they have a capacity to produce up to 230,000 tags per day. Some of the companies have <Col N="236" /> prioritised the processing of the short-term tag, which can only be used for movement directly to slaughter. This measure has considerably reduced the delay in issuing tags to farmers by three to four days.</P>

When her application was being processed it was discovered that two animals, tag numbers 121320970027 and 121320980028 were not in her ownership and possession when the application was lodged. She was written to by my Department on 21 November 2000 advising her that she was in breach of paragraph 19 of the terms and conditions of the cattle headage scheme, and informing her of the decision to disqualify her from the 2000 cattle headage scheme. She was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to the regional higher executive officer setting out any facts which she wished to put forward to support her case. Her application for a review was received by my Department on 7 December 2000. The review, which has necessitated an on-farm visit, is currently under way, and will be finalised shortly when the findings will issue to her.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million in 2001, representing an increase of £60 million over 2000. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 in the past to 109,000 in 2001. From 2001 some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 will incur some losses. I have negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be £32 rising to £64 in 2002. Concern has been expressed that farmers in the mountain category should get a higher rate of payment and this matter is being examined at present.</P>

      <P>Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate, to individuals for rent paid for private rented accommodation which is their sole or main residence. The level of rent qualifying for relief under section 473 depends on an individual's marital status and age.</P>
      <P>For those aged under 55 years of age, the maximum level of rent paid on which income tax can be claimed is £1,000 per annum single and £2,000 per annum widowed-married. This equates to a tax credit of £200 per annum single and £400 per annum widowed-married. For those aged 55 years and over the maximum level of rent paid on which tax relief can be claimed is £2,000 per annum single and £4,000 per annum widowed-married. This equates to a tax credit of £400 per annum single and £800 widowed-married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer of doubling these tax credits, estimated by reference to the expected number of claimants in 2001 and <Col N="246" /> assuming claimants have sufficient taxable income for full absorption of the increased tax credits, is £27 million in a full year. This estimate is tentative and is subject to revision.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2001 incomes, of the change mentioned by the Deputy is £1,139 million in a full year. This assumes that the value of the personal tax credits are maintained at their current level, that is £1,500 for a single person which is £7,500 at 20%.</P>
      <P>If the value of the personal tax credits were to be reduced <i>pro rata</i> to take account of the reduction in the standard rate of tax, that is decreased from £1,500 to £1,125 for a single person, then the cost would be £627.7 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Both estimates take account of a provision for a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in tax relief for expenditures such as mortgage interest relief and medical insurance which are allowable for tax purposes at the standard rate of tax. This estimate is provisional and is likely to be revised.</P>

      <P>If the value of the personal tax credits were to be recalculated to take account of this new tax rate, that is reduced to £1,125 for a single person or £7,500 at 15%, the cost would be £287.1 million in a full year.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that increasing the band for married couples with one earning by £11,000 and allowing full transferability between spouses of the £40,000 band available to married couples with two earning would cost approximately £237 million in a full year. This estimate is based on 2001 incomes data and reflects a revision to an estimated cost of £290 million which was previously provided for this change. The revision is a consequence of further refinements being applied to the costing model from which the original estimate emerged.</P>
      <P>The difference of £11,000 between married couples with one earner and two earners arises from the Government's policy of band widening to provide each income earner with his or her own standard rate band. In the 2001 budget I increased the standard rate band for married one earning couples to £29,000 and the combined standard rate band for married two earning couples to £40,000, with up to £29,000 transferable between the spouses.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year costs to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2001 incomes, of the change mentioned by the Deputy are as follows:</P>
      <P>If the personal tax credits for single and widowed persons were increased so that the combined total value of the single and PAYE credits was equal to the level of the minimum wage, based on earnings of £4.70 per hour over an assumed standard 39 hour week and with a <i>pro rata</i> increase of double that amount for married persons, the cost would be of the order of £593.5 million.</P>
      <P>If the PAYE credit alone was increased to this level, the cost would be in the region of £405.1 million; this is less costly as self-employed persons and their spouses are not entitled to avail of this allowance and, in addition, the allowance is not doubled for a married couple with one person earning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of exempting the minimum wage from taxation could also be achieved by increasing the general income tax exemption limit at an estimated cost of approximately £102.3 million. This would place a very high number of people in the marginal relief system where the marginal tax rate is 40%. It would also exacerbate the problems of poverty and employment traps for <Col N="248" /> those wishing to return to work or earn more income.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the contents of a recent newspaper report (details supplied) which suggests that there is a serious lack of urgency in the preparations being made here for the conversion from the punt to the euro; and if he will make a comprehensive statement on all of the issues raised in this report.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19671/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The article is critical of the lack of an efficient interbank system for handling cross-border retail payments in the euro area. The European Commission and the European Central Bank have made it very clear that they wish to see a single payments area where there is no frontier effect from cross-border payments within the euro area. Ultimately this is a matter for the banking sector at EU level to deliver. The European Banking Federation has recently informed the Commission of a project to create a multilateral interbank committee to reduce the cost of interbank transfers in Europe.</P>
    <P>The article also suggests that information for business preparations, including in the retail sector and for the public, is not being provided with sufficient urgency; and that the Government is leaving the euro campaign to the last minute and has abrogated its responsibility for explaining the workings of the changeover to others, specifically the banks. I reject these suggestions.</P>
    <P>An extensive range of activities has been carried out to provide information to businesses and to the public about the euro. The following is, necessarily, only a summary of the main initiatives involved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for providing Irish businesses with the information they need to make the necessary preparations for the changeover to the euro. The EMU Business Awareness Campaign, which is managed by Forfás at the request of that Department, has undertaken this task since the campaign was launched in December 1996.</P>
    <P>The campaign has produced a comprehensive range of publications about the euro changeover and these have been, and continue to be, widely disseminated to Irish businesses in very large numbers. This year alone the activities of the Forfás campaign has included the following: a major advertising campaign using television, radio, press, trade publications and Internet advertising; a new guide for SMEs on preparing for the changeover. The guide covers such areas as accounting in euro, software issues, payroll, dealing with the Revenue Commissioners, banking issues and staff training. Some 160,000 copies of this guide have been distributed to businesses throughout Ireland; and the distribution of almost 50,000 copies of the campaign's supplementary publications, that is its newsletter, strategies guide, IT guide, case studies brochure and cross-border document.</P>
    <P>The campaign also provides speakers to address conferences and-or seminars of professional, trade and business organisations, as well as participating at exhibitions and trade shows, particularly those that represent companies in the SME sector. Furthermore, a LoCall helpline is provided by the campaign to assist businesses with their changeover queries. In the first five months of this year the campaign dealt with some 3,000 queries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> The Loughrea euro town project, which was launched in March 1999, has been an integral part of the Forfás campaign. This project was a demonstration exercise whereby 30 businesses in Loughrea, County Galway were helped to change over to euro based trading at an accelerated rate. The project was based on an original concept by the Loughrea Chamber of Commerce and was developed by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign with the support of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The results of the project were presented at the national euro conference held in Loughrea last February. The project, which highlighted the changeover experiences of the SME firms as they changed over to euro, has identified practical solutions to many of the problems facing small businesses in making the changeover. Further information on the project can be found on its website www.eurotown-loughrea.ie.</P>
    <P>As regards retail businesses, a range of initiatives have been undertaken to help retailers prepare for the cash changeover. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has developed and launched a computer programme to help retailers assess their euro cash requirements for the first week of 2002. More than 10,000 copies of this programme have been distributed. It is available as a compact disk and it can be downloaded from the board's website. Forfás has produced a document entitled Getting Your Retail Businesses Ready for the Euro. Almost 200,000 copies of these guidelines have been issued, including one to every retailer in the country.</P>
    <P>As I announced in Dáil Éireann on 8 May, in order to facilitate the changeover process, agreement was reached with the banks by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and the Central Bank of Ireland whereby, in return for a lodgement fee provided by the Central Bank, banks will not charge cash handling charges on euro cash provided to retailers in advance of 1 January 2002. Banks will not enforce cash lodgement charges on Irish notes and coins lodged by retailers during the dual circulation period and for a short time afterwards &ndash; that is from 1 January 2002 until the end of the week after legal tender status is withdrawn from Irish notes and coins, that is 15 February 2002.</P>
    <P>In addition, banks are working closely with retailers in relation to the latter's requirements for euro cash in advance of 1 January 2002. Banks, retail and business organisations have been holding seminars for retailers and for businesses generally to help them prepare for the changeover.</P>
    <P>Forfás is currently preparing a training pack which will be issued to every retailer before the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>As regards the arrangements for the changeover itself, in April 2000 I published Ireland's Plan for the Changeover to Euro Cash in 2002. The cash changeover plan outlines what we should all do as individuals to make the change<Col N="251" /> over to the euro as smooth as possible for everyone; recommends that the dual circulation period should end at midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002; describes how the changeover will be implemented; and outlines the plans of the sectors and individual organisations that will be most closely involved in implementing it.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the impression given in the article, this plan was made widely known. More than 150,000 copies of the plan were distributed, mainly to businesses, and a summary of it was sent to every household in the country in summer 2000.</P>
    <P>Also contrary to the impression given in the article, the plan makes it clear that banks, building societies, post offices and, where feasible, credit unions will continue to exchange household amounts of Irish notes and coins for euro. These institutions will also continue to accept them in customer lodgements for a time after the dual circulation period. The Central Bank will also continue indefinitely to give value in euro for Irish notes and coins.</P>
    <P>The article also mentioned prices. The consumer aspects of the changeover are being addressed by Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment who has special responsibility for consumer affairs, and by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Last December they relaunched the national code of practice on the euro changeover, along with an action plan to protect consumers, as far as possible, from unwarranted price increases during the changeover. A key aspect of the code is that subscribers to it, and to any sectoral code approved under it, commit themselves to carrying out the changeover fairly and to seek no advantage from the conversion.</P>
    <P>The newspaper article mentioned public information. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has been carrying out very extensive public information activities since its establishment in May 1998. Among a wide range of items, the board has sent a leaflet about the euro to every household every year since 1998. It has done so again this year. This year's household leaflet emphasised the importance of using up hoarded coin. This theme was also stressed in a recent Central Bank advertising campaign on the same topic. The board has organised widespread circulation of posters, booklets and other information materials, including educational material for schools and materials for every teacher. It has run several advertising campaigns on television and radio and in the press. A particular feature of the board's advertising campaigns is that they are run through media and at times which are particularly focused on reaching groups at risk of low awareness &ndash; older people, people on lower incomes and people based in the home. This is contrary to the article's allegation of neglect of such groups in the euro context.</P>
    <P>The board has set up a LoCall helpline and a website, the latter has a special section for <Col N="252" /> schools. It has made a train-the-trainers pack widely available for general use. It is operating a roadshow which between May and October will visit every county. Since 1998 the board has run a programme of part funding for non-governmental organisations carrying out euro information activities. Under this programme a total of 68 grants have been paid to voluntary and representative bodies in respect of euro preparations and awareness programmes. Under the most recent phase of the programme, applications for which closed in April, more than 150 projects have been approved for funding totalling 750,000 euro.</P>
    <P>Public awareness of the euro is monitored by the board. In June I announced the top-line results of the board's most recent survey which was published in May. These showed that 95% of people know the name of the single currency; 91% have seen prices in euro; 79% know that euro cash will be introduced in January 2002; 78% have seen pictures of what euro notes and coins will look like; and 64% know that a pound converts to one euro and 27 cent. In addition to monitoring public awareness, these surveys also identify the sectors and the themes on which advertising effort needs to be focused.</P>
    <P>The needs of low awareness groups are being addressed and continue to be addressed through the board's specialised material and targeted advertising. These groups include older people, people not participating in the workforce and people with sensory or learning disabilities. The board's consultative panel, set up in 1998 and composed of organisations representing people in low awareness groups and people likely to have special needs in the changeover, helps to identify and meet these needs. Many of the projects in the board's NGO programme relate to these groups.</P>
    <P>Public information activities will intensify greatly in the autumn. The European Central Bank will be unveiling the security features of the euro notes at the end of August, and they and the appearance of the notes will be widely advertised from then on. The Euro Changeover Board will be increasing its advertising campaign substantially from September onwards and will also be distributing a booklet on the changeover to every household. Extensive dual display of prices will begin from 1 October, the latest date for its introduction under the national and approved sectoral codes. A simple to use electronic converter will be distributed to every household in November. Starter packs of euro coins will be put on sale from 17 December. So as well as the very extensive activities already carried on to date, there will be a great deal of further activity aimed at making sure that the public is ready for the changeover when it begins on 1 January 2002.</P>

      <P>Provisions were made in section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001, for a scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. For tax purposes the expenditure is deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997, or if later, the date the taxi trade commenced. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased on or before that date. Where the licence was purchased after 21 November 1997, the allowances can be claimed from the date the trade using that licence commences. The cost can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that the write-off will be allowed against the trading income of the licence <Col N="254" /> owner who drives the associated taxi. The cost will not be allowed where the licence owner rents out the licence and associated vehicle to another person except where a spouse inherits a licence from his or her deceased spouse. In the latter case, the deceased spouse must have acquired the licence on or before 21 November 2000 and he or she must have carried on a taxi trade.</P>
    <P>Relief will not be denied where the taxi owner-driver rents the vehicle to others on a part-time basis. In this latter case the cost will be allowed against both the trading and the rental income from the vehicle in question. Where more than one licensed vehicle is operated in such a manner, the capital allowances will only be available in respect of the cost of a licence relating to one vehicle.</P>
    <P>For example, a person who has paid £60,000 may claim relief of £12,000 per annum for five years provided he or she operates the taxi himself or herself full-time or on a part-time basis while also renting the taxi on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>Where a person who rented a taxi now wishes to operate the taxi himself or herself, the capital allowances for the years that the taxi was rented are notionally deemed to have been made for those years so that only a balance of the allowance would be available. For example, if a taxi plate was purchased for £60,000 on or before 21 November 2000 the expenditure is deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997. Capital allowances allowed where the owner operates the taxi himself are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question essentially relates to minibuses and the applicable rate of vehicle registration tax on such vehicles. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that minibuses containing permanent seating accommodation for 11 passengers or less are classified as category A vehicles and are liable to VRT at the appropriate rate of between 22.5% and 30% of the open market selling price. Minibuses containing permanent seating accommodation for more than 11 passengers are classified as category C vehicles and are liable to a fixed rate of VRT of £40 per vehicle. There are certain reliefs relating to VRT in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, for qualifying organisations for the transportation of disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer and to relax the permanent seating requirement would result in a significant fall in the revenue derived from category A vehicles. Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the legislation in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A reply has been issued to the person named by the Deputy. The position on the matter is as follows and this is what has been conveyed to the correspondent.</P>
      <P>The issue of debt relief is vitally important in the fight against global poverty but it also needs to be looked at in the context of the broader international development effort. Mere transfer of resources from other aid programmes, bilateral or multilateral, to fund debt relief would have little, if any, net positive effect on poverty reduction. The challenge now is to mobilise resources globally to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Ireland is on course to meet this target by 2007 and also the interim target of 0.45% of GNP by 2002, as outlined in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>On debt relief, I strongly support the aim of the heavily indebted poor countries debt relief initiative to remove some of the world's poorest countries from the burden of unsustainable debt. There are now indications that the HIPC initiative, in its current form, may not provide many of the 22 eligible countries with a permanent exit from unsustainable debt. In this regard Ireland has consistently supported calls for further enhancement of HIPC if the initiative fails to meet its stated aim, even if this were to mean additional funding on the part of donor countries. The IMF and World Bank have also indicated a willingness to re-examine cases where even after the application of HIPC debt relief serious questions remain concerning debt sustainability.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach recently pledged US$30 million per year to support the fight against HIV-AIDS. In his address to the UN General Assembly, the Taoiseach identified debt relief as one of the areas through which resources could be channelled and also signalled Ireland's willingness to participate. He stated:</P>
      <P>If another enhancement of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative is required, Ireland will not object. If this means that countries with high prevalence rates of HIV-AIDS should receive debt cancellation, Ireland will agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> I wish to leave the Deputy in no doubt that I wholeheartedly support efforts to combat global poverty and will continue to press for implementation of a HIPC initiative that delivers on its aim of exit from unsustainable debt, even if that means outright cancellation, or full debt relief, in some cases.</P>

      <P>The rates of subvention were increased from 1 April. The current rates are £90, £120 and £150, depending on whether the assessed level of dependency is medium, high or maximum. I am advised by the health boards-authority that based on the existing levels of dependency of those currently in nursing homes, the costs of doubling and trebling the current rates of subvention would be as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>Recently I signed the relevant commencement order under the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001, to give effect to the Government's budget announcement to introduce automatic eligibility for medical cards to all persons aged 70 years and over with effect from 1 July. The public was notified of this by way of large scale advertisements appearing in the national newspapers on Sunday, 1 July and Monday, 2 July.</P>
      <P>I signed the commencement order following agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on a basis for the extension of the medical card scheme to include this group. The agreement provides for a ballot of the organisation's members on the proposals developed between the negotiators and, if this agreement is accepted, it will apply with effect from 1 July. The IMO has agreed to operate the new scheme on an interim basis pending the outcome of the ballot and, accordingly, no expenditure should be incurred by members of the public entitled to avail of the new arrangements. A similar interim agreement has been reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union in respect of prescribed drugs appearing on the common list.</P>
      <P>It is not anticipated that any difficulties will arise with these arrangements. If they do, sympathetic consideration will be given to their resolution.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements only apply to persons aged 70 or over; eligibility does not extend automatically to dependants, including spouses. Any person aged 70 or over has the option of applying for a medical card in the normal way and, if this application is successful, eligibility would extend to dependants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>Representations concerning the necessity for immediate recourse to risk equalisation in our community rated voluntary health insurance market have been received from VHI. I consider it appropriate to state that contrary representations have also been received from BUPA Ireland. These representations were made in the context of the passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000.</P>
      <P>I, as my record on the passage of the Bill shows, recognise the need to provide for effective risk equalisation in a voluntary health insurance system operated on the principles of community rating and open enrolment. The debate on the Bill, at a number of stages, included consideration of amendments which, in my view, would have significantly impinged upon arrangements for risk equalisation and I was not willing to accept such amendments.</P>
      <P>As the Bill completed its passage on 20 June, it is intended that the related regulations for a risk equalisation scheme will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for affirmation as soon as possible. I hope to be in a position to do this during the autumn.</P>

      <P>The number of food poisoning cases due to bacteria other than salmonella here fell from 1,673 in 1999 to 1,552 in 2000. The incidence of salmonellosis fell from 962 in 1999 to 635 in 2000. During the period 1998 to 2000 the Food Safety Authority of Ireland received information on 101 outbreaks, that is cases involving two or more people, of infectious <Col N="263" /> intestinal diseases which were investigated by public health specialists and environmental health officers in health boards. There were 36 outbreaks caused by salmonella affecting over 1,000 people. Of these 36 outbreaks poultry was linked with 21 outbreaks, of which chicken was linked to nine, shell eggs was linked to ten and turkey was linked to two outbreaks.</P>
      <P>From data compiled by the National Disease Surveillance Centre the rate of salmonella infection in Ireland in 1999 was lower, only 27 per 100,000 population, than that in England and Wales which has a rate of 41 per 100,000, and many of the other EU countries which collaborate in ENTERNET, European collaboration of national reference laboratories and surveillance centres for Salmonella and E.Coli 0157. The rate of salmonella here has been decreasing steadily for the past three years, from a peak of 35 per 100,000 in 1998 to 17 per 100,000 in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seventh report of the WHO Surveillance <Col N="264" /> Programme for Control of Foodborne Infections and Intoxications in Europe which was published on 22 December 2000 contains details on the foods incriminated during outbreak investigations in several European countries. Comparisons should be made with caution as the methodology of surveillance systems differs significantly. Differences also exist in the categorisation of foods. The proportion of outbreaks where a food was identified due to poultry and-or poultry products varied widely and can be seen in the following table. These figures do not include outbreaks due to compound foods such as desserts, sauces and salads, which may contain ingredients such as raw egg.</P>

    <P>Concern about the numbers of poultry product associated illnesses led the FSAI to initiate industry and public information campaigns that focused on the prevention of food-borne illness caused by these products. Initiatives such as the egg quality assurance scheme run by Bord Bia in co-operation with the Irish Egg Producers Association and FSAI, awareness campaigns highlighting the use of pasteurised liquid eggs in the catering and food processing sectors and public media campaigns, have all contributed towards the reduction in the incidence of illnesses associated with poultry products over the past year.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1999 the FSAI, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, started an enhanced poultry monitoring programme. The purpose of the programme is to monitor the quality and safety of poultry products circulating on the Irish market. This ongoing programme consists of surveillance on the level of salmonella and campylobactor in raw poultry. This study was carried out last year and approximately 3,000 samples of raw poultry meat and 700 samples of cooked products were examined. All samples are tested for the presence of salmonella and campylobactor and any positive isolates are subjected to further typing techniques. The results will be published within the next few months. In an extension to this project the FSAI in 2001 is funding further work with the isolates of campylobacter from last year's surveillance work.</P>
    <P>The FSAI has also contributed to the work of the World Health Organisation-Food and Agricultural Organisation on initiatives on microbial risk assessment. The outcome of these initiatives will be the publication later this year of the world's first international risk assessment into salmonella and poultry. This report should help to identify key hazards in the broiler industry that contribute towards human salmonellosis from poultry. Ultimately this will allow the FSAI to target and introduce hygiene measures aimed at reducing the incidence of salmonellosis.</P>

      <P>It is important to note that the number of doctors working in the Irish public health service is increasing each year.

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the report of the Medical Manpower Forum sets out proposals for the re-structuring of the medical workforce both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service. The next stage is to quantify the costs, following which the Government will reconsider the proposals. A detailed quantification of the resource implications will now be undertaken.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, has overall responsibility to ensure that a co-ordinated, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> In so far as my Department is concerned, the objectives of the health response to the drug problem are based on two key elements, reducing the number of people, especially young people, turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which is a return to a drug free lifestyle. My Department and health boards collaborate in the development and running of education and prevention initiatives with the Department of Education and Science and other voluntary and community groups.</P>
    <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, runs or is involved in a number of initiatives which are aimed at tackling and reducing the number of young people misusing substances nationwide and, most particularly, within the eastern region where the majority of problem drug misusers reside. These initiatives include supporting drug education and prevention programmes and social and personal health education which is a broad based life skills programme for junior certificate students in schools.</P>
    <P>A support service to implement this programme has been established through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with health boards, Marino Institute and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The substance abuse prevention programme On My Own Two Feet will be incorporated into the SPHE programme in the future and the Walk Tall programme will continue to be implemented in primary schools. Teachers and schools are also often supported by regional health education officers from the health boards.</P>
    <P>Within the youth sector the national youth health programme has been developed through a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland. This programme provides training and support for a range of initiatives aimed at the youth sector nationwide. The programmes supported include the youth support pack for dealing with the drugs issue entitled Knowledge is Power and Drink Awareness for Everyone.</P>
    <P>A range of other training and support is offered to youth groups and youth work leaders to assist them to deal with the issue of drugs, alcohol and smoking as they arise in their work. Also within the youth sector a substantial number of drugs education workers have been appointed and supported.</P>
    <P>Within the Community Setting Drugs Questions, Local Answers is a community based programme offered by health boards which aims to activate local communities to assess the drug problem specific to their own area and then to look at ways in which the community can respond to the issues arising. The programme was developed by the health promotion unit of my Department and is delivered regionally by local <Col N="267" /> people who have been trained in delivering the programme. Being Well is another community based programme which has been developed by the unit. This programme encourages people to take a holistic approach to their health but also looks specifically at smoking and alcohol. Again this programme is supported by regional health boards and delivered by local people who have been appropriately trained.</P>
    <P>The health boards also support a range of parenting interventions such as family, communication and self-esteem. This programme helps parents to deal with the issue of drugs within the home. Health boards also fund a number of voluntary organisations whose work involves prevention and treatment of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>Services for drug users in all health boards have increased substantially over the past number of years. Funding has been provided to the regional health boards to considerably strengthen the infrastructure for the delivery of drugs services. In the eastern region, treatment services have expanded from three locations in 1995 to the current 55. The number of people receiving treatment has risen from 1,358 in 1995 to more than 5,000 now.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also know that the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, launched the National Drugs Strategy which sets out a series of specific objectives and actions for dealing with this serious problem over the next seven years. The strategy recommends 100 actions, many of which are aimed at young people. One such action is the development of a national awareness campaign highlighting the dangers of drugs by the end of 2001. My Department will be collaborating with relevant agencies in deciding the shape and nature of this campaign so that it will have maximum effect. Another action is that regional drugs task forces should be established in all health boards by the end of the year. They will strengthen present actions in relation to drug misuse and will ensure the development of an integrated and co-ordinated response to tackling the drugs problem in their region.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these actions, most of which require a multi-sectoral approach, will have a positive impact on the situation and help to reduce the number of young people turning to drug misuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act. The second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. It was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, £90, £120 and £150, and these are in accordance with the three levels of dependency which are eligible for subvention, medium, high and maximum. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is <Col N="269" /> a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The position in the Southern Health Board area is that the board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it could meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. In the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A solution has been found to meet the most immediate problems and discussions are continuing in an effort to reach agreement on a more long-term approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputies that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997 the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all of the health boards on a regular basis during the course of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Upon publication the strategy will be circulated to health boards who will be asked to draw up plans for its phased implementation. The NTHA committee will continue to play an important advisory role in relation to the implementation of the strategy following its publication. I am considering the appointment of an independent chairperson to that committee.</P>
      <P>When the strategy is published the provision of resources, including staff resources, for its implementation will be a matter for discussion with the health boards and other interested parties. I was pleased to be able to allocate £1 million in revenue funding for new developments in Traveller health services this year. This is evidence of the Government's commitment to meeting the needs of this population group.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996, gives explicit <Col N="272" /> powers to the VHI board in relation to entering into, or refusing to enter into, agreements with health service providers for the treatment and care of its members. Similarly, the regulatory framework covering health insurance business generally provides for insurers to determine the service providers in respect of whom benefits are payable for the treatment and care of members under their plans.</P>
      <P>The VHI, therefore, is entitled to determine which nursing homes it will cover for the purpose of providing convalescent care for members. Private health insurance does not cover long-term nursing care. The VHI provides cover towards the cost of convalescent home charges for up to 14 days, as required by the private health insurance regulatory framework, in approved convalescent homes listed in its directory of convalescent homes.</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing, the question of my entering negotiations on the matter of nursing homes recognition for benefit payment purposes by VHI, or any other insurer, does not arise.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme commenced in February 2000. Phase 1 of the programme has commenced in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas and offers free mammography to women aged between 50 and 64 years living in those areas. Based on the 1996 census, it is estimated that there are approximately 140,000 eligible women living within the phase one area of the pro<Col N="274" /> gramme and BreastCheck has recently informed me that up to 20 June 2001, a total of 41,630 women have been invited for screening.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of my Department that phase two of the programme, which will involve the extension of BreastCheck nationwide, should follow phase one as soon as is practicably possible. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Although children with Down's syndrome are not at present automatically eligible for a medical card, medical cards may be awarded on the basis of individual circumstances. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the programme for prosperity and fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my <Col N="278" /> Department and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>At the outset let me state that the Deputy's correspondence of 28 November 2000 does not appear to have been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>I would, however, like to take this opportunity to clarify the position in relation to state enrolled nurses. As the Deputy will be aware the state enrolled nurse (SEN) qualification is a United Kingdom qualification which is not recognised here. Persons who have obtained that qualification must undertake a nursing conversion programme in the United Kingdom in order to qualify for registration as a nurse.</P>
      <P>In response to the important contribution by SENs working in the Irish health service to patient care across a range of settings, I recently announced details of a new initiative to assist SENs to become registered nurses. Under this initiative, any SEN working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake a nursing conversion programme in the United Kingdom will now qualify for a non-means tested grant of £6,000. The grant will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the SEN to work as a nurse in the Irish health service following completion of the programme and registration with An Bord Altranais. SENs who successfully complete a nursing conversion programme which commenced not earlier than January 2000 will also qualify for the grant of £6,000.</P>
      <P>I wish to confirm that the individual named in the Deputy's correspondence is one of a group of 33 SENs who have successfully completed the nursing conversion programme. Her application for a once-off grant was approved and she received a letter from my Department to this effect. The funding for these individuals was channelled through the Midland Health Board. The board confirmed on 3 May that all the payments to this group had been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been made aware of the outcome of the recent urinary fluoride level tests carried out on a group of Kildare county councillors.</P>
      <P>The tests were carried out in a homeopathic practice and need to be interpreted with caution. Unless such tests are carried out by an internationally accredited laboratory under strictly controlled conditions the results may be subject to error.</P>
      <P>The fluoride levels in water supplies in Ireland are controlled by regulation. There is a comprehensive system of monitoring by local authorities and health boards to ensure that the level of fluoride in the water supply does not exceed the limit recommended by the World Health Organisation of 1,000 micrograms per litre.</P>
      <P>The annual report of the Environmental Protection Agency confirms that over 99.75% of analyses of Irish water supplies are within the EU limit of 1,500 micrograms per litre of water and 94% are within the stricter Irish limit of 1,000 micrograms per litre. The later level is recommended by the World Health Organisation for protecting teeth against tooth decay.</P>
      <P>A major research project measuring fluoride ingestion in the Irish population is being carried out at the Oral Health Services Research Centre NUI, University College Cork. The report will be published in 2002.</P>
      <P>I established the forum on fluoridation in May 2000. The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area and to report to the Minister. The forum has invited submissions from the public.</P>
      <P>The forum's interim report, which is available on its web site (http://www.fluoridationforum.ie), gives details of the forum's progress to the end of 2000. A further progress report has been prepared by the forum's <i>rapporteur </i>and is also available on the aforementioned website. The forum will present its recommendations to me at the end of October 2001.</P>

      <P>In addition, under the National Development Plan, 2001 to 2006, a further £188 million of capital funding has been allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the provision of additional new facilities for older people. Approximately 1,200 public long-stay beds will be provided in that period, as well as day care centres and units for dementia sufferers. Some 2,000 day care places per week will be provided.</P>
      <P>It is also anticipated that the number of private nursing home places will increase over the coming years, and these will benefit older people who will be entitled to nursing home subvention.</P>
      <P>I am aware that an increase in the population of dependent older people will continue to make additional demands on the services, but I am confident that the necessary further service development will be put in place to meet these demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy. This annual report provides important statistical information on consultant staffing in the public health service. While I am aware that in some locations there is a lower ratio of consultants to population than in other regions, the overall picture points to a significant increase in consultant posts in this country over the last number of years. In 2000 there was an increase of 120, 8.3%, hospital consultant posts in the public hospital service. Indeed the report shows that over the past decade the number of approved posts of hospital consultant has increased by 40% and non-consultant hospital doctor posts are up by 48%.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy would be aware the medical manpower forum was established in 1998 to examine medical staffing issues. The report of this forum was presented to Government earlier this year. The Government has noted the recommendations of this report in relation to a consultant-delivered public hospital service and will consider these proposals again in the light of the results obtained from a costing study on the matter which is to be undertaken by a national task force on medical manpower, the establishment of which has been approved by the Government. The Government has also approved the commencement of negotiations with the relevant parties on core issues arising from the report, including flexibility and cover arrangements, team working, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the forum on medical manpower sets out proposals for the restructuring of the medical workforce both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service. <Col N="285" /> The next stage is to quantify the costs, following which the Government will reconsider the proposals. A detailed quantification of the resource implications will now be undertaken. This assessment will form part of the functions of the national task force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been significant investment in the non-national roads network in recent years. In the current year over £323 million has been provided for non-national roads. This compares with £174.8 million in 1997 &ndash; an increase of nearly 85%. The national development plan guarantees that there will be expenditure of £1,900 million at current prices on non-national roads in the 2002-06 period.</P>
      <P>Various non-national road grant categories have seen major funding increases in recent years such as the restoration programme and discretionary maintenance and improvement grants to county councils, block grants to urban authorities and the special block grant for footpath and carriageway restoration introduced for urban authorities in 1999. The non-national roads programme has also had to adapt to emerging needs which has resulted in the introduction of new grant categories such as grants to support housing and other development, low cost safety improvement grants and regional traffic management grants for the county boroughs of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The extent of road openings by telecommunications operators and the damage being caused to the road network is a source of concern, particularly in the Dublin City area. The Government recently approved the drafting of the Communications (Regulation) Bill which proposes, <i>inter alia</i>, to modernise legislation in relation to road openings by telecommunications operators.</P>
      <P>Powers available under existing legislation, particularly section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1962, are being used by urban road authorities to regulate the opening of roads by utilities. Dublin Corporation is making extensive use of these powers through its &ldquo;Directions for the Control and Management of Roadworks in Dublin City&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Dublin Transportation Office is chairing a new working group whose task is to streamline procedures and draft guidelines on issues related to the provision of underground utilities and related infrastructure. The working group met for the first time on 8 June and is comprised of representatives from the various bodies concerned with network rollout, i.e., Office of the Director of Telecommunications, Department of Public Enterprise, Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities, IBEC, Forfás, National Roads Authority and Eircom.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons grant scheme is administered by the local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979 and statutory regulations made under that Act. Under the regulations, there is no legal bar to the payment of a second disabled persons grant in respect of a household, either in a situation where there is more than one disabled member or where the needs of a person with a disability change over time. Generally, however, the need for grants of this nature should not occur if the local authority and the applicant ensure that the original grant aided works are properly executed and appropriate to the long-term needs of the applicant.</P>
      <P>In the case of a private house, the grant may amount to 90% of the cost of the work and, generally, local authorities limit their maximum grant to £16,000. In the case of a local authority house, the grant covers the full cost of the works. My Department recoups to local authorities two thirds of their grant expenditure up to a maximum recoupment of £10,666 per case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 311 and 312 together.</P>
      <P>In determining non-national road grant allocations for 2001, the objective has been to resource all local authorities appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. This process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement conditions, traffic volumes, length of road network and suitability in relation to criteria for EU co-financing to each local authority.</P>
      <P>My Department's Memorandum on Grants for Non-National Roads states that the cost of remedial works arising as a result of flooding and storm damage must be met from the combined State grant-own resources provision to each local authority and that local authorities should, each year provide a contingency sum from this overall provision so as to finance road and bridge restoration works which may be necessitated by severe weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Over £323 million has been allocated in non-national road grants in 2001. The allocation of £17.87 million in 2001 to county councils in discretionary maintenance grants is an increase of 30% compared to 2000. The allocation in 2001 of £36.74 million to county councils in restoration maintenance grants represents a 10% increase compared to 2000. Details of individual grant allocations may be found in the 2001 non-national roads allocations booklet, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>As the NRA has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads, my Department provides a block grant to the NRA in respect of national road maintenance, which is £40 million in 2001. An ice detection monitoring system to predict ice formations on national roads has also been developed by the NRA and is operated by the NRA and road authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes, on the basis of fair compensation to landowners, has operated widely in Ireland for many years and is supported by the Constitution and a range of legislative proposals which have been regularly upheld by the courts. It is a basic principle within this process that landowners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Compensation is comprised of a number of elements. The fundamental point of reference is the market value of the land. Compensatory provision is also made for disturbance, severance and injurious affection. These in certain circumstances would exceed the land value element of the total compensation package. In addition, accommodation works such as underpasses are also catered for. Where a dispute arises about compensation the matter is referable to an independent arbitrator.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to a fair and equitable compulsory purchase process. The Government is also concerned that the national development programme should be delivered on time and cost effectively so that the country as a whole can enjoy sustained economic growth and more balanced regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> The proposals published by the IFA for amendment of the arrangements for compulsory acquisition of land have been discussed on a number of occasions between IFA and the Department of the Environment and Local Government and other relevant agencies, including the National Roads Authority. These discussions have taken place in the context of the commitment in the programme for prosperity and fairness to the &ldquo;fair and efficient implementation of compulsory purchase orders&rdquo;, and are continuing. Pending the completion of these discussions, I do not propose to comment on particular details of the IFA proposals.</P>

      <P>The Government's integrated strategy on homelessness, which was launched last year, outlines a new approach to the way in which services for the homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. As part of the strategy, local authorities have established homeless fora, where they were not already in place, and are in the process of developing three-year action plans jointly with the health boards and voluntary bodies. These action plans will set out clear aims and actions on how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved. The plan for the Dublin area, where there is the greatest incidence of homelessness, has been launched and is being implemented by Dublin Corporation's Homeless Agency.</P>

      <P>The rent payable to a voluntary housing body under the voluntary housing rental subsidy scheme is income-related and is standard throughout the country. Local authorities are responsible for the determination of the rents of their own dwellings and therefore rents payable by their tenants may vary depending on the local authority area in which the house is located. There is no requirement on local authorities to include a ceiling in their rent schemes although some authorities do so.</P>
      <P>The rent payable under the rental subsidy scheme to an approved housing body by a tenant of a house qualifying for subsidy is based on household and subsidiary income in the previous tax year. There is no maximum on the rent payable in such cases. However, the supplement to the rent by reference to each subsidiary earner is subject to a maximum of £20 per week. Revised arrangements for the rental subsidy scheme, which came into effect on the 1st July, 1999 allow approved bodies some flexibility in relation to the rent terms applicable to their projects where they consider it appropriate, subject to the overall rent yield being not less than what would have been payable under the previous rents scheme.</P>
      <P>Where a tenant of a dwelling provided under the rental subsidy scheme produces satisfactory evidence of a fall in income and of the likelihood of such a fall being sustained for at least four weeks, the weekly rent may be adjusted by the approved housing body to the level appropriate to the reduced rate of income for the full duration of the reduction in income.</P>
      <P>In determining rents under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, approved bodies are expected to have regard to the tenant's income and the outlay of the body on the accommodation, including ongoing costs of its management and maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals to remove from local authorities the flexibility they currently have in <Col N="294" /> relation to rent determination in regard to their rented housing stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of major road project planning, local authorities initiate, at an early stage, a process of public consultation in connection with route selection. Typically the initial public consultation takes the form of an information brochure or similar material addressed to local communities and business interests outlining the need for the project, a general description of broad-band corridor route options and a questionnaire seeking the views and concerns of the public. In addition, public presentations are arranged by the local authority at a number of venues in the area concerned to outline the proposal and address requests for information or clarification.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the public response, together with the findings of studies conducted to identify route constraints, the local authority identifies a preferred route, which is also the subject of public consultation. The primary purpose of the consultation exercise is to bring the public up-to-date on developments in the planning of the project taking account of public feedback and the findings of constraint studies and, in particular, to outline information on the preferred route option.</P>
      <P>The above consultations are pre-statutory and it is not considered appropriate for them to be subjected to detailed regulation. The statutory procedures for taking forward major road projects which involve environmental impact assessment and motorway scheme or compulsory purchase order, are set out in Part IV of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the NRA and local authorities to comply with statutory procedures in relation to public notice and the provision of access to <Col N="295" /> environmental impact statements, motorway schemes and CPOs.</P>

      <P>Last year, 66 hostels for homeless persons received funding from local authorities and a list of the areas where they are located follows. My Department does not have a breakdown of this information for previous years. Expenditure by local authorities in funding hostels for homeless persons is 90% recouped by my Department.</P>
      <P>While there are a significant number of hostel beds available throughout the country, the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness, was launched last year recognised the lack of transitional and long-term accommodation for homeless persons as a problem. Many homeless persons have been resident in hostels for long periods of time due to the lack of more suitable alternative accommodation.</P>
      <P>As part of the strategy, local authorities, in conjunction with health boards and voluntary bodies, are now drawing up three year local action plans to tackle homelessness. The provision of transitional and long-term accommodation, to enable homeless persons move out of hostel accommodation, and thereby free up hostel spaces, will be a major element of these plans. The plans for Dublin, Limerick and Cork have been completed and work is well under way on finalising plans for other areas. To enable this additional accommodation to be provided, capital spending by local authorities on accommodation for homeless persons is to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the five years 2001-06 and voluntary bodies will also continue to provide additional accommodation for homeless persons under the voluntary housing schemes operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>Following is a table showing the location of homeless persons' hostels in receipt of funding from local authorities, 2000.</P>

According to the most recent assessment of housing needs, which took place in March 1999, there were 5,234 homeless persons in the country. The next assessment of housing needs, which will also establish the up to date position on the extent of homelessness, is due to take place in March 2002.</P>
      <P>My Department recouped a total of £9.95 million in 1999 and £12.47 million in 2000 to local authorities in respect of costs incurred in providing emergency and sheltered accommodation for homeless persons.

      <P>Ó thaobh an chórais phleanála de, tá forálacha don chéad uair san Acht Pleanála agus Forbartha, 2000, chun cosaint na Gaeltachta agus ár n-oidhreachta Gaeilge a fheabhsú tríd an bpróiseas pleanála. Tá cuid de na forálacha sin tosaithe cheana féin, go háirithe an dualgas atá ar an údarás pleanála cuspóir a áireamh ina phlean forbartha chun oidhreacht teanga agus chultúrtha na Gaeltachta a chosaint agus chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga an phobail áit a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta i gceantar an phlean forbartha. Beidh mé in ann, de thoradh an chéad bheart rialacháin eile atá á thabhairt chun críche i mo Roinn, forálacha an Achta maidir le smacht ar fhorbhairt (na forálacha eile maidir le cosaint na Gaeltachta ina measc) a chur i bhfeidhm. Caithfear ceadú roimh ré ó Thithe an Oireachtais a fháil maidir le cuid de na rialacháin seo agus tá sé i gceist agam dréacht-rialacháin a chur faoi bhráid an Oireachtais go han-luath.</P>

Measfar aighneacht ina thaobh sin a sheol an Coimisiún chuig mo Roinn nuair a bheidh treoirlínte ar phleannanna forbartha á n-ullmhú.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gcóras rialtais áitiúil, tá bearthaithe agam an Bille Rialtais Áitiúil a leasú trí fhoráil bhreise a chuirfeadh dualgas ar údaráis aitiúla na bearta cuí a chur i bhfeidhm ionas úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.

These plans set out the arrangements for mobilising and co-ordinating the emergency response to any event which causes or threatens death or injury, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property on a scale beyond the normal capabilities of the Garda, local authorities and health services.</P>

      <P>Part III of the Building Control Regulations, 1997, provides for the issue of a fire safety certificate (FSC) by a building control authority. The FSC certifies that the works or building, if constructed in accordance with the plans, documents and information submitted, would comply with the requirements of Part B (Fire Safety) of the regulations. A fire safety certificate is required for building work in categories specified in Article II(I) of the regulations, including the construction or material alteration of commercial premises, places of work and assembly, institutional buildings and the common areas of apartment blocks.</P>
      <P>Article 12(2) of the regulations requires that where a fire safety certificate is required in respect of works or a building, a person shall not carry out such works in the absence of such a certificate.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for compliance with the building regulations is a matter for the designer, builder, and owner of a building. Enforcement of the regulations is the responsibility of the local building control authorities.</P>

      <P>The 1982 Report of the Stardust Tribunal made a wide range of recommendations in relation to the fire service and other related matters. All of these recommendations have received full and careful consideration and have either been implemented or taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy on fire safety and the development of the local authority fire services in the intervening per<Col N="301" /> iod. Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, training, the legislative framework, and emergency planning.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these improvements have significantly strengthened the capacity of the service to respond to fires and other emergencies, and in fire prevention activities.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these very positive developments in the fire service over the past 20 years, I have recently appointed Farrell Grant Sparks Consulting Limited to undertake a wide ranging strategic review of the service. The objective of the review will be to examine and report on the arrangements to ensure that people, property and the environment are protected from fire and other emergencies by the provision of quality fire safety and emergency services. I expect the review to be finalised in the autumn and to provide a report into the future direction of this important service.</P>

In this context, the EU continues to undertake intensive international consultations in the lead up to the resumption of negotiations at the 6th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bonn in July 2001. The overall EU aim will be to achieve a comprehensive outcome in the resumed negotiations, which will enable sufficient parties to ratify the protocol in time for entry into force by 2002, while ensuring the environmental integrity of the protocol.

      <P>Water quality standards designed to protect public health and the environment are set by the Quality of Bathing Waters Regulations, 1992, which also prescribe the location, methods and frequency of sampling, the methods of analysis <Col N="302" /> and inspection to be used and other related requirements in relation to waters designated as bathing areas. Local authorities are required by the regulations to display, or make available, near the bathing area, the results of sampling together with a map indicating the location of sampling; maintain a register of sampling results and make it available for inspection by any person; give appropriate public notice where bathing waters fail to meet the prescribed standards and supply the sampling results to the Environmental Protection Agency not later than 31 October each year.</P>
      <P>A national report is compiled by the agency and sent to the European Commission which publishes a report for the EU. The report of the European Commission on the quality of bathing water for the 2000 bathing season confirms that Irish bathing waters are among the best in Europe in terms of water quality, and indicates that 98.3% of coastal bathing areas, and 100% of freshwater areas, comply with the mandatory EU values.</P>

      <P>The information requested is set out in the following table. The board currently has a membership of ten, including the chairman. One of the posts is vacant and arrangements are in train to fill the vacancy. Ordinary members are appointed for a five year term or until they reach the age of 65 years.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, as amended, provides for a permanent board membership of six. However, because of the ongoing increase in the number of appeals to the board, the number of board members was increased to ten on a temporary basis until 6 November 2001, pursuant to section 1 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, when operative in this respect, will provide for a permanent complement of eight board members, including the chairperson. It also provides for the appointment of additional ordinary members to the board where the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is of the opinion that the number of cases being received by the board is at such a level that it necessitates the appointment of one or more additional board members in order for the board to fulfil it statutory duty and objective. Regulations giving effect to these provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, are being prepared.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the board is appointed for a seven year term by Government from among a list of candidates recommended by a statutory selection committee, established in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the 1983 Act. The appointment of ordinary members of the board is governed by section 7 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, as amended by section 1<i>(b)</i> of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998. One appointment as an ordinary member of An Bord Pleanála is made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government from among the officers of the Minister who are established civil servants. Other appointments as ordinary members of the board are made by the Minister from among persons nominated by organisations on panels which are prescribed as being representative of a number of interests, namely, physical planning and development, the environment and amenities, economic development and construction industry and social, economic and general interests.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible, under section 11 of the Housing Act, 1988, for making schemes of letting priorities to determine the order of priority to be afforded to applicants in the letting of dwellings provided by the authority. The order of priority of different categories of persons in a scheme of letting priorities and other details of a scheme are a matter for each local authority.</P>
      <P>Guidelines which issued when section 11 was first introduced indicated that the aim of a scheme of letting priorities should be to promote equality of opportunity in getting access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs to ensure that a dwelling, if suitable, is let to the person in greatest need and to ensure that no category of needy persons is at a permanent disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis </i>other categories. The making of a scheme of letting priorities, or any amendment to it, is subject to ministerial approval to ensure that the adopted scheme is in accordance with statutory requirements and that all categories of need specified in section 9(2) of the Housing Act, 1988, are covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>There was a proposal a number of years ago to introduce formal points-based systems for all local authority schemes of letting priorities. However some local authorities were opposed to the introduction of such a system as being unduly cumbersome &ndash; particularly where applicants could opt for a wide range of alternative areas &ndash; staff intensive and potentially divisive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the primary responsibility of local authorities for assessing and responding to housing need, I regard it as a matter for each authority to determine whether their scheme of <Col N="306" /> letting priorities should incorporate a formal points system.</P>

In 2000, the funding provided enabled 913 schemes to be carried out, of which 698 were fully completed and 215 were partially completed. This £8 million allocation for 2001 will enable county councils to make good progress in reducing the number of applications they have on hands.</P>

      <P>Information on activity under the affordable housing scheme, including the number of houses completed, is published in my Department's housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Library. Initially, progress under the scheme was slow and, against this background, the income qualifying limits and mortgage subsidy levels were increased with effect from 15 June 2000. In addition, a subsidy in respect of the site cost and development was introduced. There has been an expansion in activity under the scheme since then and I am confident that the number of houses completed will increase significantly over the next few years.</P>

      <P>Local authorities may provide housing sites at low cost to assist persons in housing need to provide their own housing. My Department has encouraged local authorities to review the scope for expanding the use of the sale of sites scheme in order to meet increasing housing needs. My Department has also advised local authorities that should they require additional funds under the scheme it is open to them to make adjustments within their overall housing capital allocations to cater for any increased demand for private sites that may arise.</P>
      <P>As part of the measures to increase the supply of affordable housing set out in Action on Housing, I introduced a site subsidy for houses provided by local authorities under the affordable housing scheme and also in respect of new houses sold by local authorities under the shared ownership scheme. The level of subsidy is £30,000 in the major urban areas and £25,000 in other areas.</P>

      <P>I understand that total spending on rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is expected to reach £134 million this year. I do not have information on the estimated cost of this scheme, which is the responsibility of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, in future years.</P>
      <P>A total of £6 billion was included in the national development plan for the provision of social and affordable housing. An additional £1 billion has been provided under the Government Action on Housing of June 2000, bringing the total housing allocation to £7 billion over the period of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. This major investment will greatly increase social housing output and help to reduce dependence on rent subsidy. There is, of course, a significant proportion of rent supplement claimants whose need is for income support to meet short-term needs rather than, for example, local authority housing.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, as signalled in Action on Housing, to develop a new mechanism involving local authority/private sector arrangements to provide rental accommodation for eligible households who would otherwise be dependent on SWA rent supplementation. This approach will be pursued initially on a pilot basis. However, commencement of pilot schemes has been delayed pending agreement of liaison arrangements with health board CWOs.</P>

      <P>Under the shared ownership scheme, applicants are required to purchase at least 40% of the value of the dwelling and to rent the remaining share from the local authority. The maximum loan which may be advanced by a local authority in respect of the share of the dwelling being purchased is £100,000. This enables an applicant to purchase a house considerably in excess of this value subject to their income being sufficient to meet the financial commitments involved. I have no proposals to increase this maximum limit at this stage but will continue to keep it under review.</P>

      <P>Irish air quality is generally good, as reported by the EPA annually in its air quality monitoring reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adequacy of measures to monitor air pollution is a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authorities and the EPA. Since February 1999, under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations, 1999, the EPA has been designated as the responsible body for the requirements of the EU Framework Directive 96/62/EC for ambient air quality assessment and management. In discharge of these functions, the agency has, <i>inter alia</i>, published the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme: A Discussion Document &ndash; August 2000. This provides the basis for the future development over the next ten years of Ireland's air quality monitoring network to meet the technical standards and other requirements, that is, distribution nationally and micro-scale location, set out in the Framework <Col N="312" /> Directive and subsequent and prospective daughter directives dealing with specific pollutants. The discussion document is available in the Library.</P>
    <P>Recommendations arising from the national monitoring programme and the preliminary assessment of national air quality, also prepared by the EPA in pursuance of its responsibilities under the EU directives concerned, will form the basis for decisions by the agency and local authorities in relation to future air quality monitoring.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 and 364 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan, which sets out a strategic framework for the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006, provides for investment totalling £5.3 billion &ndash; 6.7 billion &ndash; in the national road network. Satisfactory progress is being made by local authorities and the National Roads Authority on the detailed programming of the work required and in the planning, design and implementation of individual national roads projects. Total overall expenditure on national roads improvements amounted to £481 million in 2000 &ndash; 17% more than forecast in the NDP. Projected expenditure in 2001 is £620 million plus £40 million on maintenance, with 20 projects expected to open to traffic and work due to start on a further 23. Good progress is being made on the planning and design of the upgrading of five major inter-urban routes and their completion by 2006 &ndash; by 2007 in the case of Waterford &ndash; is on schedule.</P>
      <P>The availability of sufficient cost effective construction industry capacity and the efficient operation of the CPO system will be critical to the efficient and effective delivery of the national roads development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to the construction industry is that construction cost inflation generally averaged 12.5% over the past two years. If sustained, this level of inflation will have implications for the timely and cost effective delivery of the NDP infrastructure programmes, including the roads development programme. A number of measures have been taken to expand construction industry capacity, including an action plan on <Col N="313" /> construction industry capacity, the greater use of PPP and the promotion of greater participation by foreign contractors. In addition the NRA is pursuing a range of measures to moderate cost increases.</P>
    <P>The position on land acquisition is that my Department and the NRA have been in discussion with the IFA in regard to the operation of the CPO system and compensation for land. Discussion are continuing in an effort to resolve the issues involved.</P>

      <P>Having regard to these targets, current and proposed regional waste management plans provide for household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas, an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations, a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities, thermal treatment and energy recovery, and environmentally sound disposal of residual wastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To support the delivery of improved waste services and infrastructure under these plans, some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the National Development Plan <Col N="314" /> 2000-2006. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan. Further details about this grant scheme will be announced shortly.</P>

These include Part II on development plans, Part V on the supply of housing, Part IX on strategic development zones, Part XIV on the acquisition of land, Part XX which amends the Roads Act, 1993, and Part XVI on the licensing of outdoor events.</P>
      <P>Regulations are currently being finalised by my Department which will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act into force. Some of these regulations require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. I have also undertaken to bring the regulations in their entirety before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government for discussion prior to bringing them into force. A draft of the regulations will be submitted to the Oireachtas shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 and 374 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. There are almost 17,300 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of more than 88% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office and it should also be noted that the expected increase of another 5,000 carers following the recent increases in income disregards will increase this percentage to 42% of all carers who are providing more than three hours care per day, based on the results of the census pilot survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million next year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Budget 2001, in addition to the substantial weekly rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the <Col N="317" /> income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. As I have already outlined, this will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment.</P>
    <P>The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant. The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. These income disregards already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. As I announced in my budget speech, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation, whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider that abolition of the means test, at a cost in the region of £180 million to be the best way to support carers or the best use of resources.</P>
    <P>The Review of the Carer's Allowance, published in October 1998, considered the purpose and development of the carer's allowance scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development. It examined a wide range of issues, including the payment of carer's allowance, in conjunction with another social welfare payment. In this regard, the review estimated that approximately 65% of carers qualifying for carer's allowance were in receipt of another social welfare payment, either in their own right or as a qualified adult on their spouse's payment. This would not be the situation today due to the increased income disregards I have introduced which allow carers on higher joint family incomes to qualify.</P>
    <P>The review examined the purpose of the carer's allowance and concluded that it is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It noted that the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual to ensure that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. Therefore, the review concluded that two income support payments should not be made, in line with current practice. It is not possible to estimate the cost involved as information on the number of people who would qualify if the current arrangements were relaxed is not available. However, it is considered that this would be substantial and, as I noted earlier, I am not convinced that this would represent the best use of resources. Of course, a person qualifying for two social welfare payments <Col N="318" /> will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The review did propose the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>To differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to, replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others. The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The SWA scheme is <Col N="319" /> administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent or mortgage interest supplement recipients to retain their housing supplement as an in-work benefit on taking up employment, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. It is not possible to estimate the cost of extending these arrangements to low paid workers in general without specific data on the number of potential claimants and their circumstances.</P>
      <P>The conditions for receiving and retaining rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. However, income maintenance payments deal with the symptoms of the housing problem but it is also necessary to deal with the underlying imbalances in the overall housing system.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure that a full range of housing options is made available to people with long-term housing needs, many of whom currently rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement. The priority is to provide housing solutions rather than social welfare solutions to meet the housing needs of people on low incomes. In that regard, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government has also taken a number of other initiatives to improve the supply of social and affordable housing in response to the current housing situation. This is the best approach to meeting the housing needs of people on low incomes.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 377 and 380 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no change in policy in relation to the entitlement of unemployed persons, including those employed in the educational sector, to unemployment benefit or assistance during periods of involuntary unemployment. Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for, and genuinely seeking work to be entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance. The relevant legislation <Col N="321" /> specifies the circumstances in which a person is, or is not, deemed to be available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
    <P>In applying the legislation, deciding officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality and to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of existing labour market opportunities. Any person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. Persons employed in the educational sector are treated in the same way and are expected to meet the same requirements as other claimants in that regard. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to make such decisions.</P>

      <P>The free schemes, including the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who meet the conditions of a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of free schemes retain that entitlement in order to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlement following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>From October 2000, the free schemes including the telephone allowance, were extended to all persons aged 75 and over, regardless of their income and household composition. Provision was made in budget 2001 to extend further the free schemes to all persons aged 70 years and over from last May. This measure was introduced to support older people in their wish to remain in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Review of the Free Schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin in April 2000, noted that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as follows: to provide assistance to those living alone by tar<Col N="322" /> geting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
    <P>The original objective of the telephone allowance was to provide an element of protection and security in their own homes for older people and people with disabilities who were either living alone or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency. A secondary objective of the scheme was to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
    <P>The free schemes act as an important support to encouraging care in the community. The proposal to extend the telephone allowance to pensioners resident in nursing homes does not fit within the community care objectives of these schemes. Persons resident in nursing homes may already be in receipt of State support, either through the public health system or through a nursing home subvention. In addition, those living in nursing homes and other residential institutions have daily support and contact with other residents and nursing staff. For these reasons, and particularly in view of the community care objectives of the scheme, it is not proposed to extend the telephone allowance to people residing in nursing homes. Any further changes in the arrangements for the telephone allowance would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service.</P>
      <P>On 5 December, leading on from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I launched the National Committee on Volunteering, under the chairmanship of Deputy Flood. A budget of £1 million was allocated by my Department to assist the committee in carrying out its functions.</P>
      <P>The national committee decided to allocate £350,000 from the £1 million for the purpose of a grant scheme to assist in its objectives of supporting voluntary and community organisations at national and local level. This grant scheme was advertised in the national press on 29 March 2001, with a closing date for applications of 11 May 2001.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work <Col N="325" /> in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In applying the legislation, the deciding officer will have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality and a claimant to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance would be expected to take advantage of the range of labour market opportunities which exist in the present economic climate. Claimants are expected to demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to secure employment and to provide examples of such steps. Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment. However, if there is no employment available within a specialised field within a reasonable period of time, the unemployed person would be expected to broaden his or her search so as to include other types of employment.</P>
      <P>After a period of unemployment, a person would be expected to accept any employment for which he or she is qualified. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
      <P>My Department has a close working relationship with the local employment services and unemployed people are referred to the service on an on-going basis. No undue pressure is brought to bear on the customers of the LES.

      <P>To qualify for the pre-1953 contributory pension, a claimant must have entered into insurance in Ireland prior to 1953 and have at least 260 full rate contributions paid. The 260 can be made up solely of pre-1953 contributions or a mixture of contributions paid before and after 1953. However, at least one contribution must have been paid prior to 1953. As the person concerned was not insurably employed in Ireland prior to 1953, she does not qualify for the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a standard old age contributory pension &ndash; OACP &ndash; is that a person must have a certain number of contributions paid. In the case of the person concerned she would require a minimum of 260 contributions paid since commencing insurable employ<Col N="326" /> ment. According to my Department's records, she has a total of 120 paid contributions, which is insufficient to qualify for a standard rate pension.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of a reduced old age (non-contributory) pension of £23.50 per week, inclusive of a living alone allowance of £6. She also receives a fuel allowance of £8 during the 29 week period from October to April each year and has entitlement to various free scheme benefits.</P>

      <P>Contract meter readers engaged by the ESB are considered to be self-employed persons for social insurance purposes. Successive decisions by deciding officers of the Department and, where appropriate, by appeals officers of the Social Welfare Appeals Office have confirmed this position. Accordingly, contract meter readers pay PRSI as self-employed persons &ndash; PRSI Class S.</P>
      <P>The ESB Meter Readers' Association have sought a further review of the employment status and PRSI position of contract meter readers. They were invited to submit a number of test cases to scope section in the Department for formal decisions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six test cases were submitted to the Department and a deciding officer, having considered the available evidence, concluded that the persons concerned are self-employed for social <Col N="327" /> insurance purposes and that PRSI Class S is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The persons concerned have appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. Having made a preliminary examination of these cases an appeals officer has concluded that an oral appeal hearing is necessary. It is not possible to give a precise date for this oral hearing at present but, subject to the availability of all the parties to the appeal, it is hoped to set it up during the next two months.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to insurability must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to the decision-making process.</P>

      <P>Claims under the one parent family payment scheme are processed from my Department's office in Sligo. This office also administers all of the main pensions schemes for which the Department is responsible.</P>
      <P>In the case of the one parent family payment scheme, around 18,000 claims a year &ndash; the equivalent to about 350 per week &ndash; are being received at present. Over the past 12 months, the average number of weeks to decide a claim was ten weeks in the case of unmarried claimants and 14 weeks in the case of separated claimants.</P>
      <P>The time taken to process individual claims varies significantly having regard to the difficulty or otherwise in establishing the circumstances in each case. It should be noted, however, that a large majority of applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payment will normally continue until entitlement to one-parent family payment is determined. Every effort is being made to process applications as quickly as possible and to minimise the time during which applicants receive these alternative forms of support.</P>
      <P>It is intended to devolve the administration of the one-parent family payment to the Department's network of local offices around the country. This will assist in reducing claim processing times, through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network. As part of this process, a project to test the localisation concept is being piloted in one of the Departments regions &ndash; the Dublin west region. The experience gained in this pilot will be fed into the further development of the localisation of this scheme.</P>

      <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities. My role is to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. This is enshrined in the recently enacted Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. I believe this to be the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures. A planning authority must have regard, under the Act, to any recommendation made by me. However, it is open to the planning authority to decide not to comply with a recommendation, provided that an explanation is made outlining the reasons why inclusion in the record of protected structures is considered inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, came into effect on 1 January 2000. Implementation procedures are gradually taking shape as the local planning authorities get to grips with wide ranging new responsibilities. While ultimately a review of the legislation is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, my Department is monitoring the operation of these new measures. It would be premature to consider amending this legislation, pending further experience of its operation, in my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Sligo Borough Council, last February I recommended to the council that a total of 284 structures be placed on its record of protected structures. I am aware of decisions taken by the council on 11 June last. However, the Deputy will appreciate that, under the legis<Col N="330" /> lation, responsibility for the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a record of protected structures rests with the elected representatives. I understand that the council is to consider the matter further following receipt of legal advice.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to inform the Deputy that the re-roofing of the west wing of Castletown House is complete &ndash; phase V of the programme &ndash; and that the structure of the house is now secured.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the provision of visitor facilities are at a very early stage and it is not possible at this point in time to give a timetable for this major project. However, I can assure the Deputy that, notwithstanding the substantial funding which I have already allocated to this project to date, I have ensured that Castletown will benefit from the funds allocated to me under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. This will enable my Department to make significant progress with the proposed provision of visitor facilities, which will greatly enhance the attraction of this historic property as a tourism destination of significant importance.</P>

      <P>My Department has maintained regular contact with the National Roads Authority leading up to, and since the agreement with, the authority in July 2000 of a code of practice.</P>
      <P>This code is intended to form the basis of a framework within which the NRA will be able to get on with its programme of work whilst carrying out appropriate mitigation of impacts on the archaeological heritage. The code is based on a set of agreed principles and actions and will be supplemented with further guidelines from my Department. The code demonstrates the NRA's commitment to a responsible approach to the protection of the archaeological heritage. In doing so, the NRA is showing the way forward for other developers and hopefully this code will serve as a model for similar codes with other development sectors with whom discussions are already ongoing.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the NRA has already signalled their very real commitment to the code by appointing their own team of project archaeologists to the various road schemes around the country. This cadre of archaeologists represents the largest body of archaeological expertise outside of my Department and, over all, I am satisfied that the code of practice, which aims to address the impacts of road development on the archaeological heritage, is operating effectively.</P>
      <P>Meetings are held relating to individual road projects as issues arise.</P>

      <P>My Department has recently received copies of the proposed route corridor options relating to the M9/10 roadways. I understand that the National Roads Authority has retained archaeological consultants to carry out the required archaeological constraint studies on the proposed route options. As agreed under the code of practice between the NRA and my Department, a project archaeologist for this scheme is about to be appointed. The project archaeologist will be involved in the route selection process and will, in consultation with my officials, ensure that all possible measures are taken to protect and record the archaeological heritage. My officials will meet with the consultant archaeologists appointed by the NRA for the road scheme, when all the archaeological studies have been completed. I am satisfied that the code of practice, which aims to address the impacts of road development on the archaeological heritage, is operating effectively.</P>

In order to prevent the possibility of further damage being caused at the site during the duration of these works, my Department made a decision to limit access to the site for visitors to the periods 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays, periods during which the Department is in a position to supervise the site.</P>
      <P>My Department is conscious of the importance of the site both to the local community and to visitors to the area, and it was for this reason that my officials met with the members of Donegal County Council from the area on 14 May to advise them of the planned works and to provide details of the timing of the necessary road closures.</P>

      <P>A number of factors would have to be taken into account in estimating the cost of introducing four weeks leave for fathers <Col N="334" /> at the time of the birth of a child, including the up-take and the amount of any possible payment.</P>
      <P>Last year, 54,239 children were born and, at that time, 75.56% of males &ndash; aged between 15 and 64 years old &ndash; were in employment. Based on these figures, approximately 41,000 per annum would potentially be eligible to avail of leave in the event of the introduction of leave for fathers at the time of the birth of a child. The likely uptake of such leave would depend, <i>inter alia</i>, on whether or not the leave would attract a payment and, if so, what type of payment.</P>
      <P>The uptake of the leave entitlement would also be affected by the manner in which the four week period could be taken, for example, in a block of four consecutive weeks at the time of the birth or a more flexible, broken format agreed between the employer and employee.</P>
      <P>Any entitlement to leave would have a cost implication for employers in terms of the absence of the father from the workplace, for example, the cost of replacing the father while on leave. A monetary cost would also arise if the leave were to be paid by the employer. Employers' costs would be alleviated if payment was made on the same basis as maternity leave, that is, a payment by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs based on the fathers' social security contributions. The introduction of payment of this nature would also have additional cost implications for the State, in terms of the cost of putting an administration system in place for such leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. £344 million, comprising EU and Exchequer funding, has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. This represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State. The funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is targeted at services which offer daycare facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> With regard to the number of children receiving a child care service, my Department, with the assistance of EU funding, commissioned the first ever child care census which was carried out by Area Development Management Ltd. on my Department's behalf. The National Childcare Census was carried out over a period between 1998 and 1999 and a total of 2,607 child care facilities nationwide participated in the census. The number of children receiving a child care service in the census was 59,421, of which 35,204 were in private services and 24,217 were in community based services. This survey represents baseline data for the child care sector.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of the availability of funding in April 2000, I have committed funding in excess of £40 million to over 470 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sector. I have been informed that up to the end of June, 15,120 child care places will be supported by this funding which will ensure both the continuation of existing places and the creation of 6,375 new child care places, of which 2,193 will be in private services and 4,182 in community based services. The funding will support 11,653 child care places in the community sector and 3,467 child care places in the private sector as well as enabling many of the services to extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of service provided.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has also asked about the number of staff involved in the provision of child care. According to the National Childcare Census, there were a total of 5,498 paid child care workers in the surveyed services, 3,712 in the private sector and 1,786 in the community based sector. The number of child care staff positions which will be supported in services which have received funding from my Department since April 2000 is 1,934, of which 498 will be employed in private services and 1,436 will be employed in community based child care services. It should be noted that <Col N="336" /> these staffing figures do not include FÁS CE/JI child care workers.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have approved funding of more than £10 million for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, innovative projects, local child care training models, the Childminders Initiative and supports for the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations. This brings the total amount allocated under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme to over £50 million up to the end of June.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000 to 2006, funding is available to self-employed/private sector child care providers for capital expenditure only. This programme provides, for the first time, capital grants to private child care providers. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000 to 2006, is a roll-over programme with an open-ended application system which is necessary in order to facilitate the development of a child care infrastructure over the seven years of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The following table shows the amount approved specifically for capital and current purposes &ndash; staffing grant &ndash; and the amount drawn down by community based or private child care providers. In addition to the allocation in the following table, funding of more than £8.37 million was allocated in 2000 under the quality improvement measure towards local training models, innovative child care projects and to seven national voluntary child care organisations to develop their child care role bringing the total allocated in 2000 to £29,824,498.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a Government decision earlier this year to consolidate funding for child care services led to the transfer of school age child care funds to my Department from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science. This funding includes the out-of-school hours funding measure previously within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. This funding measure provided capital and staffing grants to community child care providers specifically for the provision of child care for school-going children, either after school hours or during school holidays. Some of the actual expenditure by my Department during 2001 refers to funding committed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs during 2000 for out-of-school age child care. This spend is included in the totals outlined above for 2001.</P>
    <P>The difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out to date reflects, in the case of capital projects, to the fact that payments are made in stages as work progresses. In many instances building contractors are unable to progress work on capital projects as soon as had been expected. In the case of staffing support applications, the difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out to date reflects the fact that the grants are allocated over a three-year period and the requirements placed on groups in relation to recruitment procedures. It should be noted that because payments are made in stages, some of the funding draw down to date in 2001 relate to projects approved for funding during 2000.</P>
    <P>Apart from expenditure under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000 to 2006, over £4.393 million of my Department's expenditure on child care during 2000 is attributable to the Pilot Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 1998-1999. This programme was allocated a budget of £6.1 million for the two year period 1998 and 1999, together with an additional £5.1 million EU/ESF budget allocation in June 1999 to be expended by June 2000. Of this £4.393 million expenditure in 2000 from 1998/99 programme, £1.538 million was in capital expenditure and £2.855 million in current expenditure.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, capital and staffing grant schemes for community-based/not-for-profit groups are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000 to 2006.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Family Centre in question, in December 2000 I approved a staffing grant of £105,872 over three years. I understand that, to date, £20,000 of this funding has been drawn down by the organisation.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the equal opportunities child care section of my Department that a completed application form for a capital grant was received from the organisation in question on 23 May 2001. I understand from my officials that this capital grant application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited on 24 May 2001. A technical assessment of this application will be carried out by ADM Limited prior to referral to the programme appraisal committee.</P>
      <P>Once the assessment and appraisal process is complete, I will make a decision shortly thereafter. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the application.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department operates a capital and staffing grant scheme for community based/not-for-profit groups as part of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme. This programme has been established under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, and is part funded by the European Union.</P>
      <P>A Government decision to consolidate funding for child care services has led to the transfer of school age child care funds to my Department from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science. This decision has brought the funding available for child care in my Department up to 2006 to £344 million.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the two projects, the Canal After School Club and the Dolphin House Homework Club, had each made an application for out of school hours funding to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. As a consequence of the consolidation of Government funding for child care services, my Department is now responsible for processing these applications.</P>
      <P>A technical assessment of these applications was recently carried out by ADM Limited prior to referral to the programme appraisal committee and I hope to make a decision shortly on both these applications. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the application.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remaining two projects, Canal Communities Art Therapy Project and Creativity in the Classroom Project, I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunities child care section that applications for funding have not been received from either of these projects. Application forms and guidelines for child care grants are available from my Department's equal opportunities child care section on Lo-call 1890-20-90-30. Should either project wish to submit an application for funding under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, this application will be considered in line with the established guidelines. However, it should be noted that the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme is exclusively targeted at the provision and enhancement of child care places.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the chief superintendent, Sligo, has received correspondence from An Taisce on this matter, that an investigation is under way and that a file is being prepared for submission to the law officers.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has also investigated the matter and that the Garda Síochána has and will continue to liaise with that Department. I am also informed that the allegation that a member of the Garda Síochána may have been involved in removing timber which was felled without a felling licence is also under investigation, although I understand that no previous complaint in relation to this aspect of the matter had been received by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that Maynooth and Celbridge Garda stations are in the Naas District. Naas Garda station is open on a 24 hour basis. Leixlip Garda station is in the Lucan District. Lucan Garda station is open on a 24 hour basis. There is one patrol car assigned to the town of Maynooth for routine patrolling. Celbridge has two patrol cars, one for detective branch and one for routine patrolling. A total of 19 vehicles are allocated to the Naas district.</P>
      <P>Leixlip has two vehicles, a community policing van and one patrol car for routine patrolling. A total of 16 vehicles are allocated to the Lucan district. When Maynooth, Celbridge and Leixlip Garda stations are not open, PACB and call diversion systems are in operation and linked to the district headquarters. A message is then relayed to a patrol car to attend to the call. Resources are augmented as required by district and divisional mobile patrols.</P>
      <P>The extension of station opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoors administrative duties. Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. Local Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements currently in place at these stations are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the areas in question. I am further informed that it is not proposed to designate Maynooth Garda station as a district headquarters at this time.</P>

      <P>The person in question arrived in the State on 3 November 2000 and applied for asylum. It subsequently transpired that he had previously applied for asylum in Germany and accordingly Ireland applied to Germany to accept responsibility for this applicant under the Dublin Convention. On 9 May 2001 Germany accepted responsibility for the person concerned under Article 8 of the Dublin Convention. The person concerned was sent a Notice of Determination by registered post on 11 May 2001 informing him that his application for refugee status was being transferred to Germany under Article 8 of the Dublin Convention.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed the determination on 21 May 2001. On 29 June 2001 the Refugee Appeals Tribunal informed the Dublin convention unit of my Department that it had affirmed the determination of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that the person concerned should be transferred to Germany in accordance with the Dublin Convention.

      <P>There are currently no plans for the installation of Garda CCTV systems in the towns referred to by the Deputy. I also understand that no applications have been received by the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems, in respect of the towns in question.</P>
      <P>By way of general information, applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. The applications may then be considered by the advisory committee who will make a recommendation to me in this regard. Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime and public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances or needs that exist.</P>
      <P>Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting etc. A total of £12 million is to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche of the expansion programme, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001-02.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority and I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press <Col N="348" /> ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>My Department is represented on the structures which are in place to develop and implement multi-agency, integrated strategies to deal with the problem of drug misuse at national, regional and local level as defined in the report, Building on Experience &ndash; National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. Under the national drugs strategy many initiatives have been developed and implemented which are specifically targeted at children and teenagers.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated considerable funding towards dealing with the drugs problem in local communities and towards tackling social exclusion. Action plans, reflecting multi-agency policies, were prepared by the local drugs task forces and evaluated by the national drugs strategy team. Some £10 million was allocated on an annual basis since 1998 to support the implementation of over 200 projects approved from the action plans. In addition, a further £15 million over a two year period has been allocated to support the development and implementation of new action plans by the local drugs task forces.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department provides funding for a total of 51 Garda youth diversion projects in both urban and rural areas. The projects, which are overseen by my Department in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, are a crime prevention measure which aim, through both intervention and prevention, to divert young people, residing within their catchment area, who are most at risk, from becoming involved in criminal activity, vandalism, substance misuse and other anti-social activities. In addition, my Department also financially supports a total of seven drug misuse awareness-prevention projects in the Dublin and Cork areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda schools programme for primary school children throughout the country endeavours to develop sensible and responsible patterns of behaviour in young people that would empower children in matters of their own safety and their social and legal responsibilities. Drug <Col N="349" /> awareness and education is one of the topics covered by members of the Garda Síochána implementing this programme. It aims to enable the children to differentiate between medicines and drugs, consider the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the body and also help children to understand the importance of choice and decision making in their lives.</P>
    <P>A similar educational programme is currently being developed for second level schools and ten pilot schemes are scheduled to come into operation from September 2001. This programme will operate in conjunction with the social, personal and health education syllabus of the junior cycle, which was prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and approved by the Department of Education and Science. The Deputy may also wish to note that the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science, in particular, are involved in a number of initiatives aimed at drug misuse prevention among young people.</P>

As I outlined in that reply, trespass on either public or private land falls, for the most part, to be addressed by means of civil remedy. However, there are circumstances where trespass may also be dealt with under the criminal law, and I am assured by the Garda authorities that where offences under such law are detected, appropriate action, including prosecution, is taken. Although I have no proposals at present to amend the law in relation to trespass, my Department will continue to keep the matter under review.</P>

Both bodies are independent in the exercise of their functions under the 1996 Act. A final decision on any particular application can only be made by me upon receipt of a recommendation from the relevant body.</P>
      <P>From information made available to me by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, I understand that the initial application from the applicant in question was received in March 2000. The applicant was interviewed in May 2001 and a recommendation is expected shortly. The primary statutory function of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is the fair and equitable investigation of applications from those who seek a declaration of refugee status and to issue appropriate recommendations to me. The investigation and assessment of an applicant's particular skills in relation to demand in the workforce is not part of the commissioner's remit.</P>
      <P>The current processing time for asylum applications at first application stage, that is, from application to interview to recommendation, generally takes between three to 19 months depending on whether the applicant is scheduled for interview immediately as a new arrival or is part of other outstanding applications. With regard to timescales for processing asylum applications, I would point out that following the sanctioning of significant additional staff resources for the asylum and immigration areas of my Department, most of which have now been recruited, a comprehensive asylum strategy is now in place which is aimed at greatly increasing processing capacity to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status leading to the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six month period; the processing of the asylum applications currently on hands as soon as possible; and dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations which are expected to arise in respect of persons who do not qualify for refugee status.

I am further informed that there have been 37 arrests since 1 January 2001 for public order offences committed on Temple Street. I am assured by the Garda authorities that the licence for the Temple Theatre will be kept under review, as is the case for all licensed premises.</P>

      <P>Section 19 of the Refugee Act, 1996, provides the legislative basis for ensuring that the identity of an applicant for asylum is kept confidential by all involved in the application process. This is an essential safeguard for the protection not only of applicants themselves but also of their relatives left behind in the country where persecution may have arisen. In that regard, section 19(1) of the Act places an onus on a number of parties including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and their respective officers to take all practicable steps to keep confidential the identity of applicants for refugee status. Section 19(2) provides that subject to sections 9(15) and 26, no matter likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as an applicant for refugee status under Act shall be published or broadcast without the consent of the person and the consent of the Minister, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that the prohibition on the publication or broadcast of material, without an applicants consent, is justified in the interests of the protection of the asylum seeker, I indicated earlier this year that, in line with practice in other EU member states, I proposed to take advantage of the next suitable legislative opportunity to bring forward an amendment to section 19(2) solely to remove the requirement of the Minister's consent. The National Union of Journalists wrote welcoming my announcement and at that time an acknowledgement issued from my office. It is my intention subject to Government approval, to bring forward the necessary amendment to section 19(2) of the Refugee Act, 1996, in the framework of the Immigration (Carriers <Col N="354" /> Liability) Bill at present in course of preparation and which I expect will be published shortly. My office is writing to the National Union of Journalists advising them of the up to date position.</P>

      <P>The new National Drugs Strategy, 2001-08, which was launched on 10 May, brings all elements of drugs policy in Ireland into a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned. Under each of the four pillars &ndash; supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research &ndash; a series of objectives and key performance indicators have been set with specific targets that Departments and agencies are required to meet. A series of 100 individual actions have also been developed which the relevant bodies have to carry out to deliver the strategy and meet its objectives. A copy of the strategy is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>In relation to prevention, the strategy sets an overall objective of creating greater societal awareness about the dangers and prevalence of drug misuse and equipping young people and other vulnerable groups with the skills and supports necessary to make informed choices about their health, personal and social development. A number of actions are contained in the strategy for the Department of Education and Science, which are aimed at educating young people about drugs related issues. They include having a comprehensive substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools and, as a first step, implementing the Walk Tall and On My Own Two Feet programmes in all schools in the Local Drugs Task Force areas during the academic year 2001-02 and delivering the SPHE programme, social, personal and health education, in all second level schools nationwide by September 2003. In addition, it is intended to have a national awareness campaign, highlighting the dangers of drugs, developed especially by the health promotion unit.</P>

The aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. To date, £46 million has been allocated under the fund since it was established in 1998. The primary focus of the fund is on local drugs task force areas and selected urban areas &ndash; Galway, Limerick, South Cork City, Waterford and Carlow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main framework of support for tourist accommodation, which applies in all areas of the State, is the accelerated capital allowances scheme for hotels. Under that scheme, capital expenditure on any building or structure in use <Col N="359" /> as a hotel or holiday camp, registered with Bord Fáilte, may qualify for capital allowances. Beneficiaries are entitled to claim a maximum 15% capital allowance in years one to six and 10% in the final year. This compares with the 4% per annum write-off available for ordinary industrial buildings. As recently as February last, the Irish Hotels Federation, in its document, Blueprint for the Future &ndash; A strategic Review and Recommendations for the Irish Hotel and Guesthouse Industry, affirmed that capital allowances remain the most important form of incentive available to hotels.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the contribution that small accommodation providers, including small hotels, have made to Irish tourism and I recognise the need to encourage and develop the sector. An initiative, targeted primarily at the small accommodation provider, has been launched whereby Bord Fáilte carried out a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category were branded and marketed overseas &ndash; with a view to increasing business overall and particularly in off-season and in rural areas. Almost £1.4 million has been set aside for this initiative to date and it has considerably expanded the range of support offered to the sector thereby developing the marketing capabilities of the operators themselves.</P>
      <P>There is a general consensus that the focus of grant-based, public investment in tourism projects must be to enhance the potential of less-developed tourism areas by supporting the development of major visitor attractions or clusters of attractions in those areas, such as I am proposing for the new tourism product investment scheme, which I have submitted for state aids approval from the European Commission. The overall objective of the new scheme will be to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>

      <P>As I previously advised the Deputy in response to Parliamentary Question No. 337 of 22 May 2001, I met with representatives from Carlow Regional Youth Service to discuss their proposal for a central youth facility for Carlow town, in the context of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund &ndash; YPFSF. The development group for the YPFSF in Carlow, which includes representation for the Carlow Regional Youth Services, had made a submission to the National Assessment Committee, NAC, of the YPFSF late last year for the development of a central youth facility for the town and for advice on how best to progress the project. They were informed at that time that no additional funding would be available from the current phase of the YPFSF, outside of their existing allocation. The second phase of the fund is due to commence in late 2002.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note that the development group made a further submission to the NAC in April seeking permission to use some of the funding allocated to them to develop the necessary plans to secure planning permission for their proposed youth facility. Following a meeting between representatives of the development group and the NAC in May this proposal was approved and the decision was communicated to the Carlow development group.</P>

Further consideration will be given to this proposal on receipt of the preliminary report from the council.

      <P>In deciding to establish a compensation scheme for survivors of abuse, the Government decided it should be directed at those persons who as children were abused in institutions in which they were resident and for which the State had significant regulatory or supervisory <Col N="362" /> responsibility. Accordingly, section 2 of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill provides that institutions for the purposes of the Bill includes industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage or children's home in which children were resident and in respect of which a public body had responsibilities relating to inspection or regulation. The basis for this decision is that the children concerned were separated from their parents and therefore did not have the care and protection which children in the care of their parents enjoy. They relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them and it is now all too clear that notwithstanding that duty children were abused. These considerations do not apply to children who were resident with their families while at school and so the Government's decision to set up a compensation body does not extend to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460 and 461 together.</P>
      <P>The practice of recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits for the purpose of the maintenance grants schemes in line with changes in the average industrial wage and to increase maintenance grants at least in line with inflation. The estimated cost of doubling the rates of maintenance grant paid in 2000 in respect of the four student support schemes is approximately £82 million. This increase would comprise approximately £75 million for the non-adjacent rate and £7 million for the adjacent rate. The estimate assumes that other variables such as the numbers of grant holders, remain unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute has estimated that the cost of increasing the reckonable income thresholds for these maintenance grants by 50% would be £124.4 million. Estimates of the further cost of applying a 50% increase to the allowances for child dependants generally and for child dependants in third-level education are not readily available. Last year, I <Col N="365" /> announced that I was setting up a special project team to undertake a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants. Issues being considered by this review, which is at present in progress, include the impact of increases in the level of grants and in eligibility and income limits. I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have had a number of meetings with representatives of the group in question. I also arranged for officials from my Department to meet with representatives of the group on Friday, 29 June 2001. Arising from this meeting, proposals for the development of special dedicated provision for children with autism at the school in question, incorporating an applied behavioural analysis element, have been put to the group for consideration. The representatives of the group have undertaken to consider the proposals put forward by my Department and to respond to these proposal in the coming days. The arrangements which have been proposed will result in the delivery of a very satisfactory response to the educational needs of the children in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding arrangements for our post primary schools have evolved in an ad hoc manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. I have already made it clear in the House that I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools. I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of <Col N="368" /> this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school.</P>
    <P>This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to per capita grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard per capita grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 490 together.</P>
      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for a national educational psychological service recommended in September 1998 that the Minister for Education and Science should establish a national educational psychological service agency, NEPS, as an executive agency of the Department. The report also recommended that the agency would have an overall target number of 200 psychologists and 36 administrative-secretarial staff. This will allow for an educational psychological service to be provided to all primary and post primary schools.</P>
      <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>Currently, 29 primary schools and all post primary schools in County Kildare have been allocated to psychologists working in NEPS. There are seven psychologists currently working in schools in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that there is a current need for some schools and parents to be able to gain access to psychological assessments pending the full development of the NEPS service. I recently announced the allocation of £1.25 million to NEPS for the purchase of assessments from private practitioners. The management of NEPS has developed an action plan for the implementation of this scheme. Guidelines on how to avail <Col N="374" /> of the scheme will be issued to schools in September 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current approach to tackling the drug problem in Ireland has developed around the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Central to the approach has been the bringing together of key agencies, both statutory and community-voluntary, in a planned and co-ordinated manner to develop a range of appropriate responses to tackle drug misuse, not just in relation to the supply of drugs but also in providing treatment and rehabilitation for those who are addicted, as well as developing appropriate preventative strategies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the prevention theme, my Department is committed to the provision of substance misuse prevention programmes for all pupils in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>At primary level, social, personal and health education now forms part of the revised primary school curriculum and will be allocated time on each school's timetable. Support for the introduction of SPHE will begin this autumn, when all primary teachers will begin to attend professional development programmes to enable them to teach the curriculum. This work will build on the training programmes already provided in areas which form part of SPHE, the child abuse prevention programme, relationships and sexuality education and the substance misuse prevention programme. The support programme for SPHE will continue for two academic years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At post-primary level, the introduction of social personal and health education on a phased basis to all post-primary schools at junior cycle level began in October 2000. It is anticipated that all post-primary schools will have a programme in place within three years. A support service, consisting of a national co-ordinator and ten regional development officers is in place and is being jointly supported by my Department and the Department of Health and Children. As part <Col N="375" /> of this process, a professional development programme for teachers will be organised, and classroom resource materials will be made available to all post-primary schools. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has plans to prepare a programme of SPHE for senior cycle pupils.</P>
    <P>SPHE programmes that are planned and consistent throughout a school will enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will inform their decisions and actions both during their time in school and in their future lives. As SPHE has a moral and spiritual dimension, its development and implementation will be influenced significantly by the ethos and characteristic spirit of the individual school. The manner in which SPHE is being introduced accommodates this position and the input of parents into the process is both valued and encouraged.</P>

      <P>The various tax reliefs for third level education were merged into a single relief in the Finance Act, 2001. The 2001 Act also widens considerably the scope of the relief. Subject to the terms of the Act, tax relief is available in respect <i>inter alia</i> of approved courses in colleges or institutions in an EU member state which provide distance education in Ireland. In common with other institutions, the Open University may seek to have specific courses, including courses in psychology, designated as approved courses for the purposes of the Act.</P>
      <P>The level of fees charged for Open University courses are a matter for that institution. The National Education Psychological Service, NEPS recognises qualifications in psychology gained through the Open University. NEPS will shortly advertise for the recruitment of further educational psychologists as part of the development plan for the service, and graduates of the Open University with the appropriate qualifications will be able to apply for these posts.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 275 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 252 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and nine mainstream class teachers for the 2001 to 2002 school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school has two learning support teachers, one special class teacher, one resource teacher, one home-school liaison teacher and one early start teacher. I have asked my Department's inspectorate to investigate if additional support for special needs pupils and resource teaching hours is required in the school. Officials from the special education section of my Department will contact the board of management directly on this issue.</P>

The posts are intended to develop innovative ways of enhancing guidance for pupils and to promote links between schools, business, voluntary and state agencies.</P>
      <P>All second level schools were invited to apply for these posts by the closing date, Friday 29 June 2001. A selection panel, involving experts in the field of guidance and project management, will assess the proposals and make recommendations as to how the posts will be allocated. Priority will be given to proposals that develop and strengthen formal links between schools, business, the local community, voluntary and state agencies, especially schools located in areas of structural unemployment-disadvantaged areas, both rural and urban, and promote the take-up of science subjects at senior cycle through establishing links with employers. An application from the school in question has been received in my Department and will be fully considered with the other applications under the terms of the initiative.</P>

      <P>The advanced certificate in special education: autism, children, and the post graduate certificate in special education: autism, children, run by the University of Birmingham, in association with St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra, are academic courses which are not confined to any particular teaching method.</P>
      <P>The training includes ways of assessing, evaluating and recording pupils' skills and behaviour. The courses consider a variety of educational approaches. They examine ways of working collaboratively and consider current theories and their implications for practice.</P>
      <P>The training aims to give students the tools to understand the various approaches, to read, evaluate and assess research papers for themselves and to make their own decision in the context of a multidisciplinary assessment as to what will work best for the individual children they are working with.</P>
      <P>Methodologies such as TEACCH and ABA are considered and workshops have taken place on these approaches in the above context.</P>
      <P>The assessment and evaluation of the courses is done on an on-going basis through the normal academic procedures and standards in place in the university. In addition, the courses are subject to review by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, QAA, which is the statutory agency dealing with such matters in the UK.</P>
