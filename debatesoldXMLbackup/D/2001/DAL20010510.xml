      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with three different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputies Flanagan and Jim Higgins. I call first on Deputy Flanagan to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance: the severe adverse consequences, including loss and damage to enterprise, business and commerce throughout the State, of the current rail dispute; and the need for a resolution to be found as a matter of urgency.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter requiring urgent consideration: <Col N="2" /> the strike by Iarnród Éireann train drivers which has now entered its third day with no sign of a resolution; the failure of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Public Enterprise to take any follow-up action or respond to correspondence they received regarding the dispute from the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union on 19 April last; and the devastating consequences for commuters and industry, particularly the tourism industry for which figures show that business is already down 30% because of the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, under Standing Order 31, to have the Dáil adjourned to examine the implications of the prediction by the Department of Finance that the national development plan costs will increase by 50% and the likelihood that this <Col N="3" /> would have a disproportionately adverse effect on the improvements planned in public transport infrastructure. In the light of the chaos in Iarnród Éireann I hope you will agree that this matter warrants urgent attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance yesterday conceded that the cost of the national development plan would increase by more than 50% over the next three years. This is having a major impact on the delivery of necessary infrastructure. The economy is growing and we hope it will continue to do so. The plan must be delivered in full and on time to ensure that the infrastructural deficit which is bedevilling our economic and social life is removed. Otherwise traffic gridlock throughout the country will be worse than it is this morning, the rail service will continue to deteriorate, Dublin Airport will be bursting at the seams and Luas will remain a plan rather than a transport system. Taking this into account and particularly taking into account that the resources dedicated to the plan appear to be largely going to extra tender costs rather than extra infrastructural projects, will the Taoiseach undertake to set in train a fundamental revaluation of the costings of the national development plan to ensure the infrastructural deficit commences to be bridged? Transport is getting worse rather than better at the moment, as anybody in this city or around the country will tell the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind not only the significant new financial difficulties that are emerging in the way of implementing the national development plan, as outlined, but the significant objections and planning difficulties, what new structural interdepartmental arrangements does the Taoiseach intend to put in place to ensure that the time frame laid out for implementing the essential infrastructural improvements is adhered to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance continually monitors the cost of implementing the national development plan across all Departments and State agencies. It is well known that price inflation in many of these areas has been quite high and although it has eased back in some areas it is still quite high. There has been a requirement to try to attract contractors from other countries for the bigger projects. There has been an aggressive campaign by the Cabinet committee on infrastructure and by the key officials group to bring the development plans to other countries and to show what is required if we are to reach the full implementation of the plan. Last year, according to the audit of the Department of Finance, 95% of the plan was completed. The House will agree that in its first full year that is a good performance. The mechanisms are in place to continue to monitor the plan across a range of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are just 16 months into a seven year plan and work is continuing on its implementation. An enormous amount of road infrastructure is involved and £1 billion is being spent on the railways. Some £200 million is being spent on Dublin Bus services, along with £86 million on Bus Éireann. In addition, there is an increased sub<Col N="5" /> vention for CIE, which is up by 51%. A sum of £600 million is being spent on the greater Dublin rail network, not to mention the national rail network. An enormous amount of infrastructure is being supplied for the Lissendale-Swords bypass linking Dublin Airport to Balbriggan. The extension of the M50 is included, as is the doubling of the bridge side.</P>

Unemployment was dealt with in the 1990s and I am glad I was part of a Government that did that. This decade is the one in which infrastructural issues will be dealt with. I am glad to be part of a Government that will do that, also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen a very good example of the Taoiseach trying to distract us all from the most fundamental problem with detail. The problem is that in the first three years of the plan, costs have risen by 53%. That means that one is getting about two thirds of the estimated output in the list the Taoiseach outlined. The Government does not seem to be sponsoring a policy to ensure that there are extra contractors in the country. For example, contractors who could have come in from Great Britain, Germany, France or Italy to build the roads are not coming because with the destruction of the private rental sector by the Minister for Finance, they would not have any accommodation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the first five months of this year housing starts have gone down by 17%? We are not getting value for money because tender prices for every public project are going up all the time. Therefore, the return on capital investment is not forthcoming and the national development plan, like many other projects for which the Taoiseach is responsible, is off the rails because it is costing 50% more than estimated. That is why we have traffic chaos and the railways and airports are in such a state. Will the Taoiseach do anything about this? All is not well in the best of all possible worlds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct Deputy Noonan and remind him that we are a year and four months &ndash; not three years &ndash; into the plan. More foreign contracting firms than ever are now tendering for projects. This is happening for major projects such as the Dublin to Belfast, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford routes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have assembled those in such a way and have made the necessary changes so that contracts can be taken in one segment rather than in smaller ones that do not interest foreign contractors. As lately as last week, we were talking to the CIF, IBEC and ICTU about the arrangements to allow compatibility with our laws and regulations for foreign contracting firms. This will allow proper arrangements for temporary accommodation which will be used for the duration of the contracts.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the price inflation eats up some of the resources and it would be nice if that were not the case. The Deputy raised the issue of house building, although the figures he quoted may be somewhat dated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness and for completeness, the Deputy should also say the price <Col N="7" /> increases of 38% are now back to just 1% or 2%. There has been an enormous improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of what is believed to have been a racially motivated petrol bomb attack on a church hall in Dublin this week? This is one of a growing pattern of racially motivated assaults and other incidents in which businesses have been attacked and windows broken. The incidents have placed members of racial minorities in this city and country under physical and verbal assault. In light of that, will the Taoiseach explain to the House why the national anti-racism awareness campaign, which was budgeted last year at £4.5 million, has not taken place? Why has the Government done nothing to educate and prepare people for a different type of cultural and racial mix here in the future? Why has the promise of 15 months ago clearly not been delivered upon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline any plans the Government may have for a multi-cultural society, as well as plans to reduce some of the racial tension which is now evident, particularly in the Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Along with all Members of the House, I condemn any such attacks which work against equality for people in this country. The high level steering group is implementing the three year strategy on anti-racism and inter-culturalism, and is working on a public awareness campaign. The group, which was established by the Minister, has been allocated the resources to do so. The group's programme, as announced, is to act as a catalyst to stimulate public awareness and understanding of cultural diversity, and to help create the conditions to make it more difficult for racism to exist. It is using its resources to contribute to a range of policies to promote an inclusive approach to minority ethnic groups, including refugees and asylum seekers. The Minister established a broad-based group, which includes representatives of ethnic minority communities involved in racism and asylum issues. It comprises the four social partners, the Equality Authority, the national consultative committee on racism and relevant Departments. It has been given its remit and received resources. It is doing its job. The timing of its work, however, is a matter for it. I am sure it has the support of the House and, certainly, the Government parties in the work it is doing. I wish it well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Taoiseach has announced was announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform 15 months ago. There has been no national campaign. A sum of £4.5 million, approved by the House, has not been spent in that time. Is the Taoiseach satisfied <Col N="8" /> with that position? Is that what we are to understand from his reply? He has repeatedly promised a review of the legislation on the incitement to racial hatred in reply to questions in the House. Where lies that review? When will there be a Government response?</P>

      <P>Everybody will agree that planning is fundamental to the provision of transport infrastructure. I refer the Taoiseach to No. 43 in the Government's legislative programme, the greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill which will make provision for land use and transport planning in the greater Dublin area and the establishment of a greater Dublin area land use and transport authority and which was launched some weeks ago with great fanfare. Yet, according to the legislative programme, it will not <Col N="9" /> be published until 2002. Will the Taoiseach ask his Minister for all talk and no action, Deputy Dempsey, to do a little better? How can we have a national plan if the fundamental legislation, announced through great public relations, will not be implemented until next year?</P>

      <P>The greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill, which will make provision for land use and transport planning in the greater Dublin area, was launched a number of weeks ago. With the agreement of all the organisations involved, the Government consented to a request that there should be a two month consultation period, approximately half of which has expired. As soon as it has concluded, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will commence work on the Bill. While it will take some time to draft the legislation, it will be well worth it for the future. Unfortunately, there never has been a land use policy for the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty Bill is scheduled for 2002. It is difficult to imagine that we are preparing to be a rogue state or will be testing nuclear weapons.

That cannot happen, however, until such time as the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited Bill is introduced. The deal cannot be finalised. On the one hand the deal is imminent. On the other, this tells us that the legislation is not envisaged until late 2001.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3: </P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 11 to 13, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the&rdquo; in line 11 down to and including &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; in line 13 and substitute &ldquo;ACC shares equal in value to 110 per cent of the value of the amount remaining outstanding shall be issued to the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We hope to sell ACC Bank to a potential customer. All of us in this House would like to see the day when a potential customer would pay £200 million or the expected amount for this valuable asset. There is a possibility the Government, the taxpayer and the Exchequer will have to carry the can for any outstanding debts. We are anxious to tie that down as far as possible. This amendment seeks to ensure that the taxpayer's exposure is minimised in that regard.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing State guarantees cannot be unilaterally withdrawn by legislation or by the repeal of the legislation under which they were given. The purpose of section 6, therefore, is to make provision for the continuation of existing State guarantees issued by the Minister under section 14 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978, after the bank is sold, to stipulate the circumstances under which they cease to apply, to require the company to repay the Minister any sums expended by him in honouring the guarantee and to provide that any such sums not paid back to the Minister are contract debts recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Section 6 will only be commenced when the bank is sold and it will be a condition of the sale that the purchaser will provide the Minister with an acceptable counter-indemnity. The exposure is nil in terms of the guarantee in that a full counter-indemnity would be in place in respect of all State guarantees in force on the day of the sale of the bank. The interests of the Minister are therefore protected by both the legislation and the counter-indemnity. This is the regime that applied in the sale of ICC Bank where the legislation and state guarantees are identical, and Bank of Scotland provided the Minister with a counter-indemnity in respect of the outstanding guarantees provided for in the legislation. There is no sound basis for the Deputy's proposal as it is more than adequately covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 24, to delete &ldquo;unsecured&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;secured&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is centred on the exposure of the Exchequer to possible costs they may incur after ACC is purchased. By substituting &ldquo;secured&rdquo; for &ldquo;unsecured&rdquo;, that possible exposure is lessened. The Minister says this is built into the legislation and that the exposure will be underwritten by the purchaser, but it is possible that the purchaser may go into liquidation. What would happen then? A bank such as the Bank of Scotland is reputable but it is not unknown for major institutions to go under. If the purchasers of the ACC went under, is the Exchequer exposed to further liabilities? The liability could be potentially enormous if all debts <Col N="19" /> are unsecured. This amendment is aimed at a situation where the purchasers are unable to continue. It is best if debts are controlled as secured rather than unsecured debts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Jim Mitchell and introduced by Deputy McGrath seeks to upgrade the status of debts owed to the Minister in a winding up of ACC Bank which would arise from the payment of moneys in respect of funds under State guarantees. The status of these debts would be raised from unsecured to secured. Under section 14(3) of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978, the Minister may require ACC Bank to give such security as he may specify in relation to a guarantee. Most such securities have been sought in relation to guarantees given by the Minister. Therefore, the effect of the proposed amendment would be to put the Minister into a preferential position <i>vis à vis</i> unsecured creditors and to improve his position in relation to secured creditors, including secured creditors already in place before the commencement of this section.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to retrospectively alter the priority of debtors in this way. In any event, it will be a condition of the sale of ACC Bank that the purchaser provide the Minister with a counter-indemnity in respect of the outstanding funds guaranteed by the State under section 6, which will only be commenced following the sale of the bank. This was the position in the case of ICC Bank. Consequently, the Minister would be paid by the new owner of ACC Bank in respect of guarantees he was required to honour.</P>
      <P>We do not know who may purchase ACC Bank. The Deputy infers that perhaps the purchaser may go under. If there was any question mark over the institution, or if it was a small institution, the Department might have concerns about it. They would then have to get a third party indemnity which would be satisfactory to complete the sale process. There is no doubt, from the Minister's and the Government's point of view, with regard to the State guarantees and their security.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I compliment the Minister on introducing this long overdue Bill which will effect major changes in the vocational education sector in Ireland. Having been a member of County Wexford VEC on and off for a number of years, I am aware of the tremendous work done in this sector. While criticisms are sometimes levelled against vocational education committees to the effect that there is too much political interference, the sector has served education well since 1930.</P>
      <P>VEC membership comprises members of all political parties although the dominant party at county council level may have greater representation on the committees. I take with a grain of salt criticism about elected representatives serving on vocational education committees because they are elected by the people and, in many cases, their children attend vocational schools. There is a tendency nowadays to believe that any committee on which a Deputy, county councillor or urban councillor sits is in some way tainted. That is not the case; political representatives have done a great deal to promote vocational education in Ireland. The fact that committee membership comprises elected representatives, teacher and parent representatives and others reflects the democratic nature of the vocational education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was growing up in Enniscorthy, vocational education was regarded as the poor man's education. Thankfully, that view had diminished. There are eight vocational colleges in County Wexford which provide a broad range of educational options &ndash; junior certificate, leaving certificate, PLCs, VTOS, Youthreach and adult education. The vocational educational system has changed dramatically since 1930 and it is only <Col N="21" /> proper that the legislation is updated to reflect that and to increase the role of parents, teachers and staff on vocational education committees. It is important that the VEC structure is widely representative and that the numbers of teacher, parent and staff representatives are stipulated in legislation. The enrolment at Enniscorthy vocational college has increased from 300 to 750 due to the number of PLC students. That entails huge increases in staff numbers; there could be 100 or more staff members in such colleges and they should have an input into the workings of the VEC.</P>
    <P>Educational partnership is very important and parents, teachers, students and elected representatives working together in harmony can only further the cause of education. Young people's current and future educational needs must be identified. Perhaps the Minister would consider the appointment of representatives from industry to vocational education committees in the future, particularly in counties in which there is a strong industrial tradition. When teachers are interviewed for VEC posts, it is common for a representative of industry to sit on the interview board.</P>
    <P>I find VEC meetings boring at times. The chief executive officer comes in with a long agenda and the committee spends up to three hours discussing it. The agenda may include such items as Mary Murphy's entitlement to maternity leave or a school's proposal to visit Paris or London. Perhaps chief executive officers feel the need to protect themselves by discussing these issues at length but they should be trusted to make these decisions. No committee member will oppose a woman's entitlement to maternity leave, a teacher's application for leave of absence or a proposal for a school tour. The Minister should ensure that committees spend their time debating more relevant and serious issues. For example, they should discuss why first year students coming into some vocational schools have serious literacy problems. More often than not, children coming into second level with literacy problems fall behind because teachers do not have the time to address them. Such issues rarely appear on a VEC agenda.</P>
    <P>Literacy problems must be tackled at primary level. We are not successful at primary level if some second level schools maintain that 50% of first year students have literacy problems. The INTO and the Minister have to seriously examine this problem as it is unacceptable that so many students enter second level with literacy problems.</P>
    <P>VECs will play an increasingly important role. There is no longer such a thing as a job for life and people are changing jobs regularly due to the opportunities now available. The construction sector, among others, is booming and it is important that vocational education committees continue to play a role in training carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers and so on. It is an important sector in terms of job creation. The <Col N="22" /> junior and leaving certificate examinations are important, but vocational training must not be forgotten in new legislation or new directions in which vocational education committees may wish to move.</P>
    <P>VTOS, Youthreach and adult education are worthwhile initiatives. However, these services are all over the place in most counties whereby offices are rented at different locations. Some have proposed stand-alone adult education centres and it is important that the Minister examines this proposal. Such a service would have to be provided on a county basis, but there should also be a regional dimension. It is important that we introduce a one-stop-shop for adult education and training.</P>
    <P>The VTOS and Youthreach initiatives have been successful and helped many back into mainstream employment. The programmes in Enniscorthy have an 80% success rate in placing people in employment and have helped people back into second and third level education. Most return to second level education as they dropped out at 14 or 15 years of age, but are now availing of opportunities provided by VTOS and Youthreach to re-enter mainstream education, including college. Such opportunities have been very good for those who may have felt they were going nowhere. Successive Governments have financed VTOS and Youthreach programmes and this must continue.</P>
    <P>PLCs have also been successful. Three years ago, 30 people were placed in a PLC in Enniscorthy, but that figure is now 400. Enniscorthy has become the PLC centre for County Wexford. While institutes of technology have also been very successful, the Minister must consider developing PLC centres on a county basis. Many students would attend such courses and a variety of different courses are available. These courses would not just be confined to those who completed the leaving certificate last year and who do not wish to attend an institute of technology. Many, particularly women, have returned to take courses in beauty therapy, hairdressing and so on which are available through PLCs. Colleges are now linked with colleges in the United Kingdom. The PLC in Enniscorthy has links with British Airways whereby it trains counter receptionists and others for the company. This linkage has been very successful. PLCs offer tremendous opportunities. As these institutions are housed in prefabricated buildings at dispersed locations, it is important that we establish PLC centres.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Wexford almost one year ago, he gave a commitment to develop a third level facility at the old St. Peter's College. This issue has dragged on and become a political football.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> The project has been delayed and there have been major problems. The Minister of State should exert pressure on <Col N="23" /> the Minister to go ahead with the project for which the Department of Finance will provide funding, but, as usual, there are complications. It is important that it goes ahead as there has been much hype to the effect that a third level facility will be established at St. Peter's College which will be linked to Carlow Institute of Technology. The directorate must be appointed soon, otherwise courses will not be up and running by September. The Minister should give priority to this issue and ensure the project goes ahead immediately.</P>
      <P>The Bill will modernise vocational education, a laudable objective. There is, however, a need for similar legislation to modernise the Department of Education and Science which still lives in the 1960s. The Department is too slow in dealing with building projects, the overall development of education and the demands for new ways and new thinking in education. For example, it can take six years or more from the time a building project is first mooted until one can walk into a new building. There was a crazy system in the 1940s and 1950s whereby one had to go through three stages or when it took three months to correct a faulty light bulb or other problems. The result of this system is that approval has been given for new schools to replace substandard buildings. However, these projects are being delayed because of the slowness of the building unit in the Department. This is unacceptable and the Minister should examine the issue.</P>
      <P>There may be a need for a partnership system whereby contractors construct buildings and hand back the finished product to the Department on a lease or buy-back basis. The current system cannot be allowed to continue because it will undo all the good work of successive Ministers in recent years regarding modernising education systems and facilities while trying to teach students in substandard buildings. This is not good enough and the Minister should examine the problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome the main objectives of the Bill as there will be a good mix of teachers, elected members and parents. However, students should have a say in how schools operate. As a result of the ASTI strike, students are no longer prepared to sit back and allow everyone else to run the education system. There should be one student on each county education committee and the Minister might examine this possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the service plan under section 21. This will provide for the introduction of the concept of the service plan to the VEC sector and prescribe in some detail the services which vocational education committees propose to provide in the year ahead. In fairness to most vocational education committees and chief executive officers, they provide a comprehensive programme at the start of every year. In Wexford we receive a comprehensive programme regarding what the colleges will do in the coming year, the number of teachers and the number of <Col N="24" /> courses that will be run. The vocational education committees provide a reasonable service in that area. The Bill provides that it will be the responsibility of the committee to adopt a service plan for the VEC. This will give committee members an opportunity for the first time to discuss the plan. Up to now, a basic plan was provided and it was adopted relatively quickly. Under the Bill, the members will have an input to the service plan. I do not suggest the committee members should interfere, but they should have the right to consider the plan and make suggestions about how it could be improved or what changes should be made. I welcome the Bill which is a step in the right direction. It is long overdue and I hope it will be passed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of my colleagues that vocational education committees have served education well. The system, which was introduced in the 1930s, provided wonderful opportunities up to the 1970s for many young entrepreneurs who would have left school after the intermediate certificate because there was no leaving certificate at that time. Many of those entrepreneurs did extremely well.</P>
      <P>As other speakers noted, the VEC system comprises teachers, other staff and parents. It provides programmes such as Youthreach and there is a need for many Youthreach centres. In Meath, there is a centre in Navan and another opened in Ashbourne within the past 12 months. A centre is also required in the northern end of the county. These centres provide a much needed service for disadvantaged children, many of whom are in community schools.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne referred to the way in which the Department deals with schools' building programmes. When I first came into the House in 1981, people in Nobber in County Meath were seeking a new school. The matter went on for approximately 14 years after it was first mooted. It also took between 12 and 14 years for Ashbourne, a growing town 12 miles from the city centre, to secure a second level school. During that time, almost 1,000 children had to be bussed each morning from Ashbourne to schools throughout the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister put in place a system under which public private partnerships could be used to deal with such cases? Politicians who are elected to the House should not have to spend most of their time trying to get the Department of Education and Science to move from one stage to the next in a building programme. Decisions on where money will be spent on new facilities are completely at the whim of whatever Minister or Government is in office. Too many children <Col N="25" /> are in substandard conditions throughout the country. This is an indictment of those who are in a position to make taxpayers money available in a proper way to ensure all children have an opportunity to be taught in proper facilities.</P>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science recently in relation to a student with special needs who needs a carer. The student is leaving primary school and going on to a community school in Dunshaughlin. However, there is no facility in the vocational system, through the Department of Education and Science and the VEC, to ensure continuity in terms of bringing the student's carer into the school in Dunshaughlin. The Minister said in his reply to the question that he is in the process of reviewing the situation to see how it could be implemented throughout the country. The problem is that students in primary schools are entitled to more hours and the carer is entitled to more pay. However, the facility does not continue in the second level sector. This is outrageous and it needs to be considered immediately if the care of individual students with health problems is to be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>We are aware from our dealings with the Minister and the Department of Education and Science at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science that the Department is antiquated. It, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children are three of a kind. They move very slowly with regard to changes that would be in the interest of people and they leave much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I am delighted new regulations on accountability will be introduced under the Bill. This will mean that in the future vocational education committees will not be able to act as Westmeath VEC did by buying property all over place without most people's knowledge. There will now be proper accountability at the end of each year. What happened in that VEC was wrong. It was not its duty or job to be involved in that activity. From that perspective, the legislation is extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>In common with Deputy Creed, I have some concerns about the provisions of section 7(<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) where two members will be elected by parents of students who are attending VEC institutions and two members will be elected by staff of the VEC. It is not clear if there will be ring fenced provisions for teaching staff. Members of the teaching staff should be entitled to two representatives and one additional member. However, it is important that there is continuity and that the different sectors involved, including parents and students, are represented. It is a good idea that students are represented. When the Minister has an opportunity to makes changes for the better, they should be applied across the board.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with one part of vocational education committees, but another aspect of their work over the years has been most worthwhile and useful to an enormous number of people. The adult education system was introduced <Col N="26" /> approximately 25 years ago and I compliment all those involved in putting it together. Huge progress has been made and the idea that two schools in smaller towns amalgamate to form a community school is worthwhile. Two days ago, the chief executive officer of the VEC in County Meath mentioned the possibility of an amalgamation of the VEC school and the girls diocesan school in Athboy.</P>
    <P>That is the way to proceed. It has proved worthwhile in other towns and to some extent it removes competition between schools.</P>
    <P>This is worthwhile legislation but much needs to be done. If a survey was undertaken of the problems in education encountered by Members of this House over the past 20 years, the need to cajole Ministers to make provision for accommodation would be highest on their list. That should not be the case. I agree with Deputy Browne's suggestion that public-private partnerships are the way to proceed. It should be a policy of the House that no children should be taught in unfavourable conditions, such as prefabs. If a health check was done on them 60% to 80% would be found to be inappropriate as centres for learning.</P>

      <P>As a former VEC member for some years and as a former teacher in a comprehensive school I am pleased to contribute to this debate. While the comprehensive schools are not governed by the same administrative structure as the VEC schools, there are links between both systems. vocational education committees have made a significant contribution over the years. As a member of the Fine Gael Party and coming from the same county as the late John Marcus O'Sullivan, I acknowledge his contribution to their establishment. It was an innovative and futuristic development and it should be recognised when we debate education, especially vocational education.</P>
      <P>The vocational education committees have made a major contribution to developing and expanding the skills base in a variety of trades and occupations, such as building, the hospitality sector and the agriculture industry. Across the board they have provided an adaptable and suitable labour force for the many different facets of the economy. While other post-primary schools concentrated on mainly academic subjects, the vocational education committees concentrated on technical education. This was as important, if not more so in certain instances, than academic education. The skills base created by the vocational education committees has been primarily responsible for bringing so many industrialists into the country, especially in the 1960s and 1970s when German and other foreign investors arrived. The light engineering skills they required were provided by the VEC schools. That must be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been a major emphasis on sport and physical education in VEC systems. In some instances vocational education committees were <Col N="27" /> the main promoters of outdoor activity centres which have become popular. For example, in County Kerry the VEC established the Cappanalea centre, which is recognised as one of the finest outdoor facilities in Europe. People travel from Europe and beyond to look at it as a model of good practice in terms of establishing outdoor activity centres through the democratic education process. This development should also be recognised.</P>
    <P>I support the principal aims of the Bill as set out in the explanatory memorandum. The Fine Gael Party introduced a Private Members' Bill some years ago to address the involvement of politicians on interview boards. The practice should be discontinued. Politicians should distance themselves from involvement in interviews. In the past vocational education committees have been bedevilled by their involvement, especially in the interview process. Perhaps the Minister may consider removing them from interview boards.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities who are councillors are not involved in selecting personnel for local authorities. That practice should be extended to the vocational education committees, which are an arm of local democracy. I will ask my party's spokesperson to move an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage. I argued for this nine or ten years ago in the House but nothing has been done. It is for the good and protection of politicians, who can be pressurised during the interviewing process. While the interview board structure has changed in that two independent assessors are on each board and while I am sure members of all political parties have been appointed by boards that do not include their party members, an amendment to this effect would remove suspicion. The present system has not helped the image of the vocational education committees and in some instances the power vested in politicians on interview boards has been abused. In the interests of vocational education and their own interest, politicians should not be involved.</P>
    <P>When I served on a VEC staff members were nominated by the political parties but they were not nominated by right by the teachers' organisations. The Bill provides that two members of staff may be selected for membership on the committee. The term &ldquo;members of staff&rdquo; needs to be defined. Presumably it means the totality of staff and not only the teaching staff. By right teachers should have membership of the proposed new body and they should be nominated by the recognised teachers' organisations. That is very important. Staff members other than teachers, such as caretakers and secretaries, also deserve the right of representation on this new body. They should be elected by their staff members. This point was made earlier by Deputy Creed and I hope the Minister will refer to it when he concludes.</P>
    <P>Four members are to be appointed by the county council to represent students, voluntary <Col N="28" /> organisations and persons in the vocational education area concerned with trades and professions in commercial or industrial activities. I believe the four people will be nominated by the political party which is in power within the VEC. It would be preferable if the students had some say in the matter; structures could be established whereby the students could make their nomination without referring to the local authority. With regard to the voluntary organisations, we have gone to great extremes to establish county development boards. The local board could also nominate a person or persons to the committee independent of the council. The representatives of the trades and other professions could be nominated through IBEC or some other appropriate organisation.</P>
    <P>If the nominations are left to the council, it is obvious the political party with a majority on the council will pick its own nominees. That is the nature of politics. The Minister should look at this matter again. In the past the sub-committees of the vocational education committees were dominated by the ruling party. However, they should be representative of all interest groups in the area. They should reflect the entire community, not just a narrow political view as was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to comment on this Bill. It is an important measure because vocational education is important for the future of the country. Technical education is increasingly in demand and the vocational education committees can now play a greater role in progressing that area of education. This Bill will help in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to discuss it. I was a member of a VEC in 1975 so I am well aware of the good work being carried out by vocational schools and the vocational education committees throughout the country. The Bill provides for representation on vocational education committees for parents of students who are registered in VEC institutions and for staff, including teachers, of vocational education committees. Other provisions in the Bill provide for additional functions for vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The vocational education committees have always made a great effort to provide education. Recent figures indicate that almost 100,000 students or 30% of second level students receive their education in VEC schools. The VEC covers a wide range of education services from basic literacy to adult education. Adult education is a most important area. The Government has invested a great deal of money in it and vocational education committees will have a particular involvement in promoting adult education services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1930 Act, which established vocational education and the vocational education committees, always referred to the important link between the vocational education system and the <Col N="29" /> local community. While it is mainly county councillors who are involved in each committee, there is also involvement on the part of people who are drawn from the general constituency of local employers, tradesmen and others. It was always envisaged that local representation would be a key part of the committee. This Bill attempts to improve that system.</P>
    <P>An important point arises, however. The VEC in County Galway, for example, is involved in 14 schools in the county. There will be a difficulty getting parents and staff involved as representatives when there is such a large number of schools in a county. That issue should be addressed. It has also been pointed out that students, who were extremely vocal in relation to their education during the ASTI dispute, have also made a strong case for representation. These are important issues because the education system is changing and the vocational education committees must also change.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees are responsible for students with a range of educational needs, whether it is the 12 or 13 year old student starting second level education or persons in their 20s or older participating in a post-leaving certificate course. Regardless of the age group, vocational education committees have been involved in providing everything from night classes to VTOS and they have done a good job in that regard. I wish them well in dealing with the major changes that will take place in education in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 18 deal with, among other things, co-operation between vocational education committees. Section 9 provides that each VEC must co-operate with other vocational education committee schools and with persons providing services similar to or connected with their schools. That is most important. We must remove duplication. One of the abiding memories of my time on the VEC is the good co-operation there was between Galway county and Galway city vocational education committees. I hope that will be expanded to cover other vocational education committees. vocational education committees in the west of Ireland must come together to provide education services.</P>
    <P>An example would be the provision of education for children from the Traveller community. In Galway, for example, there should be co-operation between the city and county vocational education committees to ensure that if there is to be a Traveller education centre, the vocational education committees could provide one to cover the county. If people believe such a centre would be segregationist, there could be a system where students go into mainstream education in the vocational school of their choice. That would involve a great deal of discussion on many issues, such as school transport for the students.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with two or more vocational education committees co-operating for the joint acquisition of property. This is a most important <Col N="30" /> issue. We could have an effective system and prevent duplication if acquisition of property by a number of vocational education committees were possible. A relevant example is the provision of activity centres. Vocational education committees have been to the fore in providing outdoor education and activity centres and the one in Clonbur, County Galway, has been a great success. Such centres would be suitable for students from Mayo and Galway. Students from other parts of the country could come to Clonbur, for example, at weekends to participate in the different outdoor educational pursuits it provides. Sections 9 and 18 are extremely important.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy about the five year plan. Nowadays, everybody talks in terms of five year plans, whether it is the local authority or the health board. Councillors often say to me that, although they have been elected, a plan is already in place in whose formulation they were not involved and they ask if any flexibility is attached to it. I hope there will be flexibility because vocational education committees have always been known for that. The Minister said there could be a review of plans and that vocational education committees could amend them. The chief executive officer must report each year to the VEC and the Minister. That is an important provision. It is not good enough to say that there is a five year plan. There must be necessary action with it. Serious issues confront us in education and major challenges lie ahead. To say we have a plan is not enough. We must study what is happening in the vocational education system each year.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the issue of school buildings. There has been rationalisation and proposed amalgamation of second level schools for many years. It is important these matters are discussed fully. I do not want a situation which happens in many towns throughout the country where the bishop, who is the trustee of one school, and the chief executive officer, who is the trustee of another, meet without the support of the board of management of the school or the members of the VEC. These discussions can take a long time, with students and teachers having to work in the meantime in prefabricated buildings and no improvement until the discussions are finalised. Measures to improve school buildings must be speeded up.</P>
    <P>Mr. Seán Cromien produced a very fine report in which he referred to the increase in the workload of the building and planning unit in the Department of Education and Science. He said this increase arose primarily because of substantially greater funding for capital purposes. He proposed that, in the medium term, the building unit should become an executive agency with a national remit to handle the construction and modification of schools. This is a good proposal which should be examined. If these issues are not finalised, prefabricated buildings will continue to be used in VEC schools, secondary schools and primary schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> One of the roles of the chief executive officer is that of transport liaison officer. School transport is an emotive issue, as any rural Member knows, especially where catchment boundaries are concerned and parents, students and teachers want to extend or change them. I have great sympathy for chief executive officers of vocational education committees who must deal with this. Mr. Cromien referred in his report to the pressure to have decisions of the Department on school transport changed. He suggested a statutory instrument could be used, where appropriate. He also suggested that school transport could be removed from the remit of the Department of Education and Science and transferred to an independent contractor. This was recommended by the Deloitte &amp; Touche study which examined this issue some years ago. The chief executive officer of each VEC has a very difficult task in sorting out school transport where pressure is applied by two adjoining schools to change or extend the catchment boundaries. If one school is granted a change in the boundaries, other schools ask why they were not granted one.</P>
    <P>On the issue of students with special educational needs, good progress has been made in primary schools by providing resource and remedial teachers. A major problem is providing the same level of resources in second level schools. The vocational education system has provided many special classes and I hope further progress is made in that regard. Primary teachers ask second level teachers if they will be able to provide resource teachers, classroom assistants and other facilities, such as in the home economics area, for students with special educational needs who are going from primary to second level. Many second level schools have classrooms on the first or second floor which immediately begs the question whether a lift will be provided for students with special needs. These issues must be addressed by the Department and especially by the vocational education committees. I hope the initiative taken by the VEC in Galway, where special needs classes are provided, will be expanded to all schools in County Galway and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the first VEC on which I served was Mr. Oliver Hynes, his successor was Mr. Conor Morris and the current chief executive officer is Mr. Philip Cribbin. I have the highest regard for those people. One aspect of County Galway VEC I always liked is that it insisted on having a number of meetings each year in a different school. It had 14 schools at the time I was a member of the committee. It was a good idea to have a meeting in each of the various schools and discuss the issues and problems affecting the staff and students in those schools. It was a good idea of those men and those committees to do that.</P>
    <P>The staffing and structure of the VEC sector is an issue. I notice in a report by Mr. Dermot Rochford of the staff relations service, included <Col N="32" /> in the IVEA News for February, that with all the new legislation being brought in, such as the Bill under discussion, the Youth Work Bill, the Education (Welfare) Bill and the implementation of the White Paper on Adult Education, many issues will have to be addressed locally by vocational education committees. Mr. Rochford made the point that the VEC sector has operated for too long on a shoestring and that serious efforts must be made to resolve some of the issues facing it. He mentioned that no survey had been conducted on the sector since the early 1980s. That obviously means much information is out of date. One positive note is that Mr. Rochford believed there was some optimism to be gained from the fact that extra clerical and administrative staff would be allocated to vocational education committees to ensure they were able to work and move forward together and to ensure their staffing and administrative structures were addressed.</P>
    <P>Another issue has been raised by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, known as the NAPD. It referred to how the school year has been eroded by a number of factors. One is oral and practical exams and how there can be mayhem in schools in March, April and May as principals and deputy principals try to provide tuition for classes while other teachers are released for orals and practicals. The question of in-service training is another issue, as is school planning. Many days are lost while these take place. The Teaching Council Bill, which I welcome, also has serious implications for teachers in maintaining and improving teaching standards and in promoting and continuing education.</P>
    <P>One of the strongest recommendations in the Cromien report was the establishment of a one-stop-shop. The report recommended the establishment of local offices to deal, for example, with the welfare scheme which was introduced in the Education Welfare Act and with the planned national educational psychological service. I agree with that recommendation. Local offices could also deal with adult education, which is being strongly promoted by the vocational education committees. The staff in these one-stop-shops would implement new education legislation.</P>
    <P>The Cromien report referred to the question of appointing teachers to VEC schools. It is remarkable that the Minister for Education and Science must approve these individual appointments while the same is not true in relation to secondary schools. We must find ways to devolve responsibilities to the vocational education committees. I ask the Minister of State to convey my view to the Minister for Education and Science that further legislation should give more independence to the VEC sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation granting representation to parents and staff of VEC schools. I hope the Bill becomes law quickly to ensure the progress of education in the VEC sector. This worthwhile sector has been in existence since 1930. It <Col N="33" /> is capable of dealing with the changes and challenges which lie ahead in education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. I hope it will not take power from elected representatives and from the vocational education committees themselves. The hope has already been expressed in some quarters that this will not happen.</P>
      <P>I am always worried when I see legislation referring to executive and elected representatives' functions. We have given too many powers to the chief executives of health boards and county managers. I hope this Bill does not give away power to the chief executive officers of vocational education committees. Vocational education committees have been among the most democratic organisations for many years. They provide representation for teachers, teaching unions, parents and elected representatives. This ensured that the community had some input into the education system while other mainstream schools, despite the representation of parents and teachers, were, in effect, controlled by the bishops. I hope this Bill does not remove these important representative powers from the community.</P>
      <P>I would like to see direct elections to vocational education committees. It is not right that the party which has a majority of seats on a local authority should control representation on the local VEC. Direct elections would be a fairer system. We would not see the cronies of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil appointed to vocational education committees and left there for 25 or 30 years. Elections to vocational education committees could be held in conjunction with local elections and substitute members could also be elected, as is done in elections for the European Parliament. I ask the Minister to examine this proposal.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker spoke of teachers waiting for the Minister to appoint them. The Minister merely decides how many teachers a school may employ. More outrageous is the practice of teachers canvassing local representatives for appointment to a VEC school. This degrading practice may have been acceptable in the 1930s and 1940s but we are now in a more modern age and we must devise another formula for appointing teachers. In many cases the people who had most to offer to education were bypassed because they were not of the same political colour as the party which controlled the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VEC sector was once the poor relation in education but that is no longer the case. VEC schools do an excellent job and employ excellent teachers. We need professional people but we also need people who are good with their hands. Students are sometimes forced into types of education to which they are not suited. Some years ago it was not acceptable for a student to be educated for a trade but I am glad that the development of the economy has meant that skilled tradespeople are now in great demand. The day of the tradesman has come while in the past they <Col N="34" /> were under-rated. The vocational education committees should encourage more young people, men and women, to enter trades such as plumbing, carpentry and block laying. Many of these skills are being lost because people are not being trained for them. Everyone wants to be a doctor or university lecturer but this cannot be the case. We need professional as well as trades people.</P>
    <P>The school curriculum should place a greater emphasis on preparation for trades. In the past people were taught Latin, English through Irish and other stupid things. Twenty years later they found that Irish and Latin were no use to them in Camden Town or New York where common sense was much more useful. If these people had been taught useful skills at school they would not have experienced such difficulties when they went abroad. Many of our emigrants were very successful. Some of have returned to Ireland and some have become millionaires in their adopted countries.</P>
    <P>I remember a teacher who used say of myself and another pupil that other teachers should not be too hard on us because we might be employing them one day. He was right. Years later I joined the VEC, although I did not remain a member for long. I found it frustrating and technical. At VEC meetings I could not understand that while the parents group was present, along with the teachers and the chief executive officer, the two union representatives were down at the back. That did not make sense to me. I support the vocational education committees which do a wonderful job. They take on the more needy in society &ndash; those who need more time, care and effort. The Outreach system has been a wonderful success as have the night classes which have provided training to many people who, for various reasons, had left the educational system but wanted to re-educate themselves. In the past, sufficient resources were not put into such education, although they should have been. It is important to cater for people who have had to leave the educational system for one reason or another. Such people have now been able to re-enter the labour market thanks to the training they received at VEC classes.</P>
    <P>Over the years the vocational education committees have done an excellent job. They have taken care of those who could not read or write, by leading a campaign to help them. But for the vocational education committees, thousands of people would not be able to read or write. They came through the conventional school system but were not identified as having literacy problems, so the system failed them. At least the vocational education committees were there to help such people in a compassionate manner. They have given people confidence to take up employment and to live in the real world, rather than shyly hiding away because they could not write their names. There was not a lot of sympathy for such people but at least the vocational education committees identified the problem and dealt with it. I compliment everybody involved in VEC work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> A man called Ernie Sweeney campaigned for years in my constituency on behalf of illiterate people. His one ambition was that ballot papers would carry photographs of the candidates so that people with literacy problems would not be taken in by political parties. In that way, if they were unable to read or write they could at least place a tick next to the candidate for whom they wished to vote. I am glad that Mr. Sweeney is now getting his wish. He did a great service for society because he was prepared to say he had come through a system which had failed him. There was somebody there to take him on board and re-educate him. When he appeared before a Dáil committee he did not let himself down. He is proof that if a person is treated in the right way he or she can be educated at any age.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister a few questions about a proposed new school in Newport, with which the VEC is dealing. I tabled a parliamentary question in this regard recently and I would like the Minister or his officials to provide the information sought. If not, I will raise the matter on the Adjournment to obtain the information. At the time I tabled the question, a catchment area for the school had not been chosen. I want to know what exactly is being proposed, what funding will be put in place and how it will affect people whose children attend schools in Achill or Westport. If this VEC school is built in Newport, will it affect parents' rights if they want to send their children to Achill or Westport? Will this become the catchment area and what effect will it have on them? Has the catchment area been chosen? I want answers to those questions so that I will not have to raise the matter on the Adjournment. If these questions cannot be answered by the Minister when he is replying to the debate, perhaps his officials could answer them in writing. If they want clarification regarding the questions I will be delighted to provide it.</P>
    <P>School catchment areas are a big issue and exceptions should be made in some cares. In north Mayo, at one stage, some children were not very good at Irish, even though they lived in the Gaeltacht. They wanted to attend an English-speaking school which was outside the Gaeltacht area but they were deprived of school transport because of that. At the time we did not have the financial resources to cater for them but if the case had been brought to court I believe the Minster would have been beaten. If children feel they are not capable of being taught through the medium of Irish, it is wrong to treat them in this way just because the only school within the catchment area is an Irish-speaking one. The matter should be examined, especially in circumstances where children living in a Gaeltacht area cannot speak sufficient Irish to attend the local gaelscoil.</P>
    <P>We often hear it said that the Irish language is discriminated against but the reverse should not occur either. Anyone who wishes to be taught through the medium of Irish should be allowed to do so and facilities should be made available <Col N="36" /> to enable this to happen, but the reverse should also be the case. Therefore, if children are weak at Irish and have to be taught through English they must be catered for. There is no point in sending them to a gaelscoil if they do not understand what is going on and cannot read, write or speak Irish. An exception should be made in such cases so that they will not lose the right to school transport by attending a school outside the catchment area. The issue must be examined. It works in reverse when somebody wants to leave their catchment area to attend an Irish-speaking school. In that case transport is provided but the reverse should also apply. The matter should be taken further at a later stage and in another forum. It is wrong to put parents in the position where they have to go to court or to the Ombudsman to obtain their rights. The Minister should take action to accede to this reasonable request.</P>
    <P>A recent report revealed details of sub-standard conditions in primary schools. It was amazing that most of the schools referred to were in the west. I hope that whatever money is required to effect repairs and to provide other facilities is made available. Money spent on education is an investment in the future of our young people and in the country generally. We should not be afraid to spend money on education. We spend a great deal of money on public relations people and reports which are rubbish. If we continue producing so many reports there will not be enough buildings in which to hold them. If enough money is paid to somebody to produce a report on education or anything else, he or she will provide the answers that one wants to hear. All the consultants do is visit the library, councils, vocational education committees or health boards, take out the last report that was produced, add a few extra words to it and charge a fortune for doing so. It would be better to put the money that is spent on such reports into education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport is the poor relation of education. I feel strongly about this and I hope the Minister will take it into consideration. I heard Deputy Deenihan speaking about it earlier, although I felt he might have taken a strong line on it. It is a mistake to treat sport in this way. It should be a compulsory part of education so that all boys and girls learn to participate, whether it is in Gaelic games, soccer, rugby or running. Facilities should be made available for sports to encourage people to take part. It is not good for their minds and bodies if they do not participate in sport. People involved in football, boxing and other sports rarely get into trouble, which is not always the <Col N="37" /> case for those with idle minds who are not prepared to take part in the local football, golf or rugby teams. We should be spending more money on improving sports facilities for young people. I compliment the vocational education committees on making such facilities available. Some schools have wonderful gyms and other sports facilities, yet young people have to tog out in vans and buses at sports fields which do not have such facilities. The vocational education committees and other secondary schools should make all their sports facilities available to young people under 18 years of age, once they are prepared to look after them.</P>
    <P>We are living in a changed world and, therefore, information on drugs should be on the school curriculum. We should educate our young people about drugs, drink and cigarettes which constitute the biggest scourge in society today. We should explain the damage these drugs do to the mind and body.</P>
    <P>I would like this to be part of the curriculum. We are always afraid to take the lead or that we will offend people. I hope this issue can be placed on the agenda in order that people are provided with the facts. One cannot beat educating people and explaining the effects of drink and drugs through slide shows and so on to young people. This should be done in every school when students are at an early age.</P>
    <P>Joe Langan is the chief executive officer of Mayo VEC and doing an excellent job. Vocational education committees, in general, do excellent work as they respond to the needs of communities. I am glad this legislation is passing through the House and that parents and students will be represented on the committees. Vocational education committees are democratic and hold public meetings. Everybody knows who are the members of their local VEC and they can make representations to them if they want to air a problem. The media also have access to meetings.</P>
    <P>I hope powers are not being taken away from vocational education committees and given to people who are not answerable to anybody. We, as public representatives, must go before the interview board for vocational education committees. The interview is difficult and the board can decide whether they want us to be present at the next meeting. Some are appointed to public positions for life and, irrespective of whether they do a good job, they remain in the position. That is wrong. Everybody should be accountable. There should not be chiefs who are not answerable to anybody.</P>
    <P>A local authority system was created. When Members table parliamentary questions regarding local authorities, they are not answered because the Minister for the Environment and Local Government says he has no powers in this regard. This is outrageous. If a parliamentary question is tabled, it should be answered in the House. We are the 166 directors of this country and if we want information from any State body <Col N="38" /> or agency, whether it be a VEC, health board or local authority, the Minster of the day should provide it. No Minister should be able to say that he or she does not have the power or responsibility. As democratically elected public representatives, we make the laws. These agencies should respond to us.</P>

      <P>The Minister outlined the age of uncertainty and change which underlines the context of the Bill and indicated that he is creating a legal structure to facilitate vocational education committees in planning for change. He intends to allow them the flexibility to provide an effective and appropriate service for the people living in their catchment areas. The Bill addresses this matter in a positive manner. While I am delighted that it has been introduced, it is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The Minister seeks to address four primary areas. First, he wants a revision of the function of vocational education committees which will seek to address the changes that have occurred in their operation. He is also providing for a wider membership of the committees on a statutory basis, although many comprise a relatively diverse membership. He is further providing for a better reporting arrangement within the committees and between individual committees and the Department of Education and Science, which is of fundamental importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for such accountability nowadays. In the past we tended to take matters for granted and did not always plan ahead in the organised manner which the Minister desires for the future. Despite this, excellent work was done by vocational education committees. Some com<Col N="39" /> mittee members, chairpersons and chief executive officers had great foresight and undertook projects about which others had doubts, but which stood the test of time and provided extremely well for the people whom they were serving.</P>
    <P>The Minster is also providing for a modern financial structure, a desirable development. We have come to realise in many areas of public life that better reporting and financial structures are needed, not least to ensure those operating them understand them. Most Members have served on local authorities at some stage and pored over annual estimates. One could, certainly, be forgiven for concluding that their format was set out in such a way as to make it impossible to understand them. We learned over time to understand where the flexibility was and where the money was going, but the system did not lend itself to scrutiny by those charged with that role. The new system proposed by the Minister in the legislation will improve the financial and reporting structures within the VEC system.</P>
    <P>VECs are involved more widely in the community and this is addressed in the legislation. A number of speakers referred to the VTOS, which has been in operation for a number of years. It stands as a beacon of achievement by vocational education committees in addressing difficulties which early school leavers, in particular, have and has operated successfully. All of us in our daily lives, as political figures, come across people who did not make it successfully through their first opportunity in the education system, but who were rescued by the VTOS and managed to secure well paid and appropriate employment. They are better contributors to society as a result of the scheme.</P>
    <P>A number of Members also addressed the importance of physical education in respect of which the vocational education committees have also been to the forefront. It must be acknowledged, however, that primary and secondary teachers have traditionally given much of their time to the promotion of competitive sports such as Gaelic football, hurling, soccer, rugby and other mainstream sports. The weakness of the system was that only those who were good enough to make the grade on school teams were catered for in the manner which perhaps everybody should have been catered for. A substantial number of second level pupils did not have access to a desirable level of physical education. This will be addressed by vocational education committees more quickly than by other education groups. Eight or nine of them already provide outdoor pursuit centres, as does County Clare VEC in the Burren, where second level pupils in particular and others from various parts of the country can spend a few days getting an introduction to sports activities that they would be unlikely to ever encounter were it not for that opportunity. I am talking about activities like abseiling, rock climbing and canoeing, minority pursuits which should be availed of much more <Col N="40" /> widely than they are currently. That is an aspect of which the vocational education committees will be conscious when preparing their education plan.</P>
    <P>The area of adult and continuing education has expanded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. It ranges from basic literacy to technology education and all the traditional and other pastimes which were provided almost exclusively, up to three or four years ago, by the vocational system, although other second and third level institutions are now providing a certain level of education in this area. Adult and continuing education is hugely important for many people in terms of widening their job opportunities and providing for the day when their current employment is terminated and they have to up-skill. In some cases people are grappling with difficulty but in many others they are enthusiastically entering into the arena of adult and continuing education and are having their lives enriched by the provision being made for them. That provision often arises from the initiatives of the local vocational education committee. There are areas such as Traveller education, which has been dealt with by vocational education committees for a number of years and has been hugely successful in some areas and a little less so in others. That was particularly successful in dealing with young Traveller women but, sadly, considerably less so in the case of the men folk. However, it is an area in which there is an openness to change and a willingness to embrace opportunities that the vocational education committees will find challenging. They will find themselves better equipped to address the challenge in the context that is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A greater number of people are availing of third level education immediately on leaving second level, which has been the traditional route, but substantial numbers of considerably older people are availing of the opportunity of getting third level qualifications at diploma or degree level. That would have been unheard of ten years ago. The vocational education committees have played a considerable role in providing some of those courses.</P>
    <P>Many areas throughout the country believe they should have a particular third level facility, and County Clare is no different in that regard. The VEC in Ennis has been pursuing the various options with the two colleges in Galway and the two colleges in Limerick and, heretofore, whatever degree courses have been provided have generally been validated by outside bodies. I welcome the fact that the traditional third level colleges, which previously did not embrace this movement with any great enthusiasm, are beginning to at least take it seriously and see the role they can play in much the same way that the Galway Regional Technical College became the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, with a campus in Castlebar. There are many more possibilities in this area than have been explored and it is one of the areas the vocational education committees <Col N="41" /> will closely examine in their education plan. Considerations of demographics, distances, populations, etc., will come into play but perhaps we have been a little too conservative in that area. If we were more adventurous, the quality and accessibility of education would be greatly enhanced.</P>
    <P>When I became a member of the VEC many years ago I was greatly impressed by the ordinary members, many of whom were county councillors and farmers. They would frequently say at meetings that they regretted not having the opportunity of getting the formal second level education that their children and those served by the VEC had, but I was always impressed by their commitment to the good of the community, the schools and the pupils who attended them. The service was well served by chief executive officers also. That was certainly the case in County Clare where Jim Lyons was the chief executive officer during the time of my involvement. He was a great man to keep abreast of changes and developments in education and he wanted to be the chief executive officer of a VEC that was at the forefront of whatever developments were taking place. That brought enormous benefits to people in the area of responsibility of the VEC.</P>
    <P>An area on which we worked hard was improving co-operation with other second level institutions in the voluntary secondary sector, community and comprehensive schools and the primary schools. There was a time when the remit was delineated clearly and there was relatively little crossover but one of the strengths of the VEC system was that it provided a structure and a membership which was open to a crossover and dialogue with others in second level and primary education.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges enabled the vocational education committees to have an input into management at third level, which brought a new vision to the VEC sector. It opened to the members, principals and teachers in the schools the vista of continuing education for people who had been through the vocational system but who wanted to go on to third level. The original regional technical colleges, a narrow definition which appeared to direct people in a particular way, are now called institutes of technology which sounds a little grander but which more accurately reflects the role we see for those colleges in a modern society. I particularly welcome the Minister's provision for a five year education plan. Anybody in this House, or in life generally, who takes the trouble to plan carefully sees the benefits four-fold or 40-fold. The harder we work and the better we plan, the luckier we get. That provision in the Bill will enhance the professionalism of their approach and greatly benefit the students at whatever level, from first year to the most elderly participant in adult and continuing education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the service plan which provides for accountability and I particularly welcome the end of year review, the formal review, which will be a <Col N="42" /> little more interesting for the first year or two but which will become less adventurous in subsequent years. Nevertheless, that will set down a marker of what has been achieved and how the plan needs to be changed for the future. That will greatly help vocational education committees in examining the kind of work they do in reviewing, planning and co-ordinating for the future.</P>
    <P>The original Bill provided for community involvement and a responsiveness to local needs that other structures and elements in education simply did not provide. It is now formally provided for in this Bill that teachers, parents, voluntary bodies and others will be formally represented. I believe that is the case on all vocational education committees but it is only right that it be provided for in the legislation. There is also provision for pupils to have their representative. Politicians and media people tend to believe that young people have no interest in community politics and development, and political parties for that matter. We are wrong to think that. Young people are rather open to the possibility of involving themselves in the development of their communities. I welcome that provision, which also relates to voluntary bodies, business associations, etc.</P>
    <P>VECs have always had to be responsive to demographic changes, patterns of employment, economic circumstances and so on and have been very successful in this regard in the past. However, in the formal context being set down under the Bill, it will be possible for them to respond more quickly to the changes which may occur. Everyone hopes that whatever changes occur in economic circumstances will be positive in nature. History teachers us that these matters are somewhat cyclical and that those in education, in business or any other facet of life who are innovative are always out in front &ndash; they are the leaders and they benefit more quickly and to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>We have consistently under estimated the role education has played in developing our economy. Vocational education has played a particularly strong role in that regard. The manner in which we have moved towards embracing advances in technology and emerging opportunities is to our credit, has been beneficial to the country and has given us an edge over others. That edge must be maintained and it will be somewhat more difficult to maintain in the future. There are other economies in which labour is a great deal cheaper. In that context, the advantage we have is that we have a better educated and more flexible work force. The vocational education committees have traditionally played a positive role in this area and will continue to do so in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the reserved executive model for vocational education committees which is somewhat similar to the local government model, which many Members have faulted more than they have praised in the past. It is important, however, that the roles of the chief executive officer and the committee be set out and that a <Col N="43" /> separation of powers be delineated. The Minister has done well to address that matter in the Bill, but it may need to be kept under review. I would not like a situation to develop where the role of the committee might be inhibited or restricted in a way that ultimately would have a negative effect. The way the Minister has set matters out, it seems the committee will be charged with the responsibility for setting policy &ndash; that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>There are areas that need to be addressed which require a local input &ndash; I refer here to school catchment areas, etc. &ndash; and I would like vocational education committees to become involved in addressing them. That will also be possible under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill. The purpose of this legislation is to provide new structures and procedures in order that each vocational education committee can meet the needs of the area for which it is responsible in as effective and efficient a manner as possible. I welcome the involvement, on a formal basis, of the parents of VEC students and the staff, including teachers. It is important that these people will have their rights formally recognised, as a result of the willingness of politicians to effect change.</P>
      <P>A further aim of the Bill is to classify the functions exercised by the vocational education committees into reserved and executive functions. I welcome that development because there are issues which must be dealt with independent of political procedures. The Bill also provides additional functions for vocational education committees and sets out revised reporting, accounting and financial procedures.</P>
      <P>Section 9 sets down the additional functions, which comprise the planning and co-ordination of the provision of education and ancillary services in educational institutions established by a VEC; reviewing the provision of education and vocational education and training in the VEC area; advising the Minister on such provision; and making plans that are economic, efficient and effective for the needs of an area, using every opportunity to consult with all relevant bodies &ndash; including parents, students, staff and other people &ndash; likely to be affected as a result of the performance by the board of its functions.</P>
      <P>Section 10 permits the Minister to confer additional functions on a VEC, subject to such conditions as he or she thinks fit. This is one of the areas in respect of which I would be slightly critical. The Minister will demand that the VEC and others will provide functions, but power without finance is not the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country has not ever been in a more financially sound position in terms of its ability to provide funds for things that are necessary and important. An example of where such provision has not been made is in the Monaghan VEC area <Col N="44" /> where the Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre has been seeking recognition for many years. It has not received such recognition and, therefore, has been unable to obtain funding. This centre provides excellent services to all the schools and the various groups in the area. As a previous speaker stated, young people are being encouraged to become involved in outdoor and healthy pursuits. The Tanagh centre, which is situated in County Monaghan but is near Cootehill, County Cavan, is an example of an initiative to which funding has not been provided by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Monaghan VEC also runs MIFET, the only institution offering third level courses in the county. The opportunities available at MIFET are limited. Last year, the Minister promised to establish an outreach centre and other centres in Monaghan. Again, however, the funding for these has not been forthcoming and yet another year has gone by without progress being made.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that St. Patrick's agricultural college was closed down almost two years ago and the site is now up for sale. There is an excellent opportunity here for the State to ensure that third level or outreach courses are provided to the people of County Monaghan. There are some modern buildings on the site and a number of older structures which could easily be converted into lecture halls. The former college is brilliantly situated, approximately one half to three quarters of a mile outside the town, in a lovely, quiet, rural setting. Is there any possibility that a public private partnership might be entered into to purchase the site and establish an institution there? It is vital that the Minister does not miss this opportunity to provide a necessary service to the people of the region.</P>
    <P>It is well known that County Monaghan has one of the lowest levels of participation in third level education. That there are no local education facilities is part of the problem. Many people in the county are employed in the furniture or food industries and do not have massive incomes. However, they often find that, when means tested, they earn just a few pounds more than the cut-off point for qualification for third level grants and, therefore, their children often lose out. In the past, those children could travel north to further their education but such opportunities are no longer as freely available as heretofore.</P>
    <P>There is a lack education facilities for those involved in the major industries located in the county. Those seeking to be educated or trained in a craft must travel either to the west or the deep south. If this was provided in a college in Monaghan, there would be a long-term guarantee that the furniture industry will be retained in the county because employees skills would be constantly upgraded and they would be able to produce higher class products &ndash; if that is possible &ndash; than those they already produce.</P>
    <P>The lack of facilities is also a major barrier to high tech industries considering Monaghan as a possible base. Industries tend to locate their oper<Col N="45" /> ations adjacent to third level colleges, such as those in Dundalk, Galway, etc., where they can avail of the opportunity to discuss with the college authorities courses which could be beneficial in terms of training students to become future employees, thus aiding their own methods of production. The provision of such a college in Monaghan on the site of St. Patrick's College would help to get good quality high technology jobs into the county. The Minister promised that third level outreach centres would be set up. The premises are available and we need them now.</P>
    <P>As regards third level courses which could be supported by the VEC and by the Government, a community learning, social and cultural centre at Truagh parish near Emyvale village in north Monaghan has got planning permission and some funding, but it needs more. It intends to have child care, hospitality and energy conservation facilities. I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will join me in congratulating the Errigal Truagh parish group which received an energy conservation award today from the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, in Buswell's Hotel. It intends to use energy conservation when it builds a new school and the community learning, social and cultural centre. I urge the Minister to immediately provide the additional funds needed to make that possible.</P>
    <P>Section 18 clearly states that two or more vocational education committees can work together. I am glad about that. The vocational education committees in Cavan and Monaghan, for example, could become involved in the Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre, which is on the Cavan-Monaghan border. This would ensure they got more funds to service the area properly. I hope those two vocational education committees will use the opportunity afforded by this Bill to work together to ensure that the best possible provisions are available for both that area and a wider area, including all the Border counties or all Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is also important. It provides for a five year plan or longer if the vocational education committees decide. This is necessary. The only way things can be done properly and in order is if people know where they are going for at least the next few years. We did that for the roads at regional and county level. While many people do not like their county far down the list, at least they have an indication of the potential. This is more important in education so people know what classes or subjects will be available. I already mentioned that facilities are not available in County Monaghan for those in the furniture or engineering industries to get third level education. It is important that students and those in apprenticeships are able to avail of courses at home. That will be clearly indicated by the VEC in a five year plan. I am also pleased the Bill insists that plan should be drawn up in consultation with the VEC teachers, who often feel left out. New measures are often introduced without proper consultation with the students, their par<Col N="46" /> ents and others who will be affected, such as the service and catering industries and the employers. They can discuss what is needed and what would help young people to get third level education at home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the VEC's efforts in adult education. People lose their jobs from time to time and it is extremely important they have an opportunity to update their education, whether in computers or another area, so they can be re-employed. Many wives and mothers want or have to go back to work. It is important they have an opportunity to upgrade their skills and to learn new ones. People who worked in offices or other jobs ten or 15 years ago before they started their families see a major change in their work.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with how vocational education committees control their finances and how they can be dealt with by the Minister if they do not perform their duties properly. It is important to have such controls, which will be debated at committee and other levels, and I welcome them. I hope the Minister does not have to use those powers, particularly in relation to the vocational education committees in the Cavan-Monaghan region which is dear to me and to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. There is nothing as good as having strict rules to ensure that people do not step out of line. Many members of vocational education committees are also members of political parties. They can have differences, but they usually work closely together, whether the committee or the administrators. They are not above any group. It is important for the Minister to have the right, if necessary, to take whatever steps are required to ensure that things do not go wrong. We have known this to happen in other areas of the country and that is sad. I support the Minister in ensuring the regulations are in place. I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill. As someone who has been privileged to serve on the City of Dublin VEC since 1985 and who was its chairman for a number of years, I have some understanding of how the vocational education committees operate and how they have delivered their functions and programmes effectively since the VEC sector was established in 1930. The Vocational Education Act, 1930, is probably one of the most enabling Acts passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I wish this generation could pass legislation similar to that which allowed the VEC sector to do what it has been doing over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said both inside and outside the House that the VEC sector is political and is a politically driven system of education. It is composed of people who are elected by the public and who serve, without political or financial gain, for the benefit of the people in their area. Allegations have been made from time to time that appointments are made out of political motivation. That has happened on only a few occasions and it rarely happens now. The Bill tries to draw <Col N="47" /> together much current practice and to formalise it in statutory form. For example, the City of Dublin VEC has for many years had student representation on its committee. This was when the VEC in Dublin was responsible not just for the 22 or 23 second level schools, but also for the six or seven third level colleges of what is now the Dublin Institute of Technology. The Dublin Institute of Technology colleges always had student representation. This was a very positive step and I commend those like Mr. Paddy Donegan, who was chairman of the VEC for many years before myself, for their foresight in allowing and enabling membership by students. Students brought a breadth of vision and freshness to debate which there would not otherwise have been. I recall acrimonious debates with student representatives over inadequate services, the high level of fees and the high level of capitation being charged, but these debates were important nonetheless.</P>
    <P>Since 1991, parents have been represented on the VEC. Long before the buzz word of &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; in education, parents' representatives were making a significant input to the VEC. The sector has been able to include parents and students through the setting up of sub-committees for second level schools. This allows members of local communities and the employment sector to debate issues which are then formalised at committee level. This has come a long way. There has also been staff representation on the VEC. I pay tribute to the teacher representatives, and in particular to the members of the TUI, for the strength they brought to the VEC. They are now also members of other committees.</P>
    <P>All who are in touch with education know of the contribution made by the vocational education committees. I first got to know of their work many years ago when I saw their Outreach services. The VEC in Kerry was providing farm advisory classes, home economics classes and budgeting classes in the early 1960s. I commend them for their flexibility. Civil servants in Marlborough Street were often angered by the pushing out of boundaries by vocational education committees which allowed for innovation, but that has been the strength of the sector. It has been able to respond to the needs of local communities, whether rural or urban, and to develop appropriate programmes. It has also been good at evaluating those programmes.</P>
    <P>The VEC sector, in co-operation with the Department of Education, promoted the Regional Technical College sector single-handed. Without the regional technical colleges, regional development would not be half as sturdy as it is. The Regional Technical Colleges brought to the regions opportunities for people to participate in third level education outside the university sector at a time when few people could avail of universities. It was a natural development of Mr. Donagh O'Malley's initiative for free second level education. The Regional Technical Colleges <Col N="48" /> have now become institutes of technology, driving regional development. In Dublin, we see the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology becoming an institute.</P>
    <P>One concern is that the institutes of technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology are drifting academically upwards and are in danger of leaving behind the important one and two year courses. They are also leaving behind the idea of apprenticeship which is equally important. Those colleges have served the area of apprenticeship extremely well. At a time when there are labour shortages, those colleges should be supporting this area of apprenticeship training and innovation in a more proactive way.</P>
    <P>The higher level courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology became the National Institute of Education, which in turn has become Dublin City University, and is a thriving hub of learning, research and academic excellence in my constituency. I compliment Mr. Danny O'Hare, the founding president of that university on the work he has done, and welcome his successor Professor Ferdinand von Prondzynski. Mr. von Prondzynski will bring renewed strengths to the development of the university. However, the university should not forget that its roots are in the VEC sector. It is rooted in the community and I believe the university understands that.</P>
    <P>Long before it was profitable or popular, and before free post-primary education, the vocational education committees were taking in those who were good with their hands. There was a tendency to shepherd those not academically gifted into the local &ldquo;tech&rdquo;, and these students studied for the group certificate. However, as the numbers striving for second level education expanded, so too did the capacity of the vocational sector to respond to those developing needs. They did not have streaming and entrance examinations. They took in anybody who arrived on their doorstep, irrespective of means, ability, or intelligence. I compliment them on that.</P>
    <P>To an extent, they have not been rewarded for this. They inevitably ended up with many weaker students and that continues to be the case in many instances with which I am familiar. A Member mentioned in this debate that many students with serious literacy and numeracy deficiencies are now transferring to the vocational sector. Because of that, the Department of Education and Science and the Minister need to vigorously address the needs of vocational schools by way of additional resources. In many cases, while classes are small by comparable standards, a smaller class of weak, often behaviourally difficult students, needs additional teaching resources. This requires additional hardware and software, and additional curriculum programmes. The Minister should be enabling and resourcing these schools to respond to the needs of students, and this can be tackled in sections 9 and 26 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Ireland is as near to full employment as it is likely to get and large numbers of students are working part-time from their early teens. They <Col N="49" /> work in places such as corner shops, and in some instances they are even working in the IT industry. I have seen the serious effects on the progress of these students of an over-involvement in part-time work. It is an area of concern. Initiatives such as the eight to 15 year programme initiated by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, some years ago, should be continued and expanded. These initiatives need to be localised. The Minister and his officials will be aware that in partnership and drug task force areas there is a tendency for specialist staff to be recruited to work with these people.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see these allocations being made directly to the schools as I am not convinced that agencies such as partnerships and task forces have as good an understanding of students' needs.</P>
    <P>The transfer of students from vocational schools to third level must be addressed. It is unsatisfactory that in constituencies such as mine third level participation rates are as low as 3% or 4% in spite of the introduction of the free fees initiative. This initiative, with which I fundamentally disagreed, has had no impact whatsoever. It has done very little for students from my own area and third level education generally.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and previous Ministers on facilitating the development of vocational schools in the post-leaving certificate area. PLCs were devised at a time when we had high levels of unemployment and needed to benefit from the European Social Fund in order to keep students in education for as long as possible. I recall numbers falling in the junior cycle in some of our schools and the attempt to devise programmes which would benefit students in the senior and post-senior cycles. The Department was extremely well disposed towards addressing this problem. I compliment the Minister for Education and Science who, when Minister for Social Welfare, made post-leaving certificate courses, such as VTOS, eligible for social welfare allowances. He did this in the absence of the imposition of any great administrative restrictions.</P>
    <P>The fact that post-leaving certificate courses are now validated by the NCVA is an important development. The curriculum development unit, a partnership between Trinity College and City of Dublin VEC, has piloted and structured new courses appropriate to the needs of students who might not otherwise have had the opportunity to participate in mainstream third level education.</P>
    <P>The issue from which I have derived most personal satisfaction is the manner in which the vocational education committees developed the vocational training opportunities scheme. At a time of high unemployment, there was a need to initially address the provision of literacy and numeracy skills, but, laterally, the focus moved towards providing opportunities for early school leavers. I recall teaching in an all boys' primary school in the Finglas area and seeing students leaving school at 14 years of age to work as van helpers with the local bakery and dairy and as <Col N="50" /> apprentices in companies such as Unidare, Whessoe and Gateaux, which was a very big employer in the area. When Gateaux closed down, Unidare downsized and Premier Dairies was taken over by a larger co-op, these young people ended up on the dole. VTOS was established primarily to address their needs.</P>
    <P>It is to the eternal credit of some very visionary people &ndash; chief executive officers, members of the Irish Vocational Education Association, the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCVA and NCEA &ndash; that they ensured VTOS courses were properly underpinned and thought out. It is a source of great satisfaction to me and others that some of the participants in the early scheme are now working as permanent teachers in vocational schools. I recently met a VTOS participant who qualified as a barrister and is working in the Law Library. I know of someone else who lectures in history in Maynooth. It is a great testimony to the flexibility of the VEC sector that people have been able to proceed so far.</P>
    <P>The Youthreach programme has also addressed the problem of early school leaving very effectively. Some criticisms have been made to the effect that the programme operates on a parallel system to the community training workshops sponsored by FÁS. I disagree with this argument as I have seen young people, who have not fitted into the mainstream school system, blossom under the Youthreach programme. Many have proceeded to sit junior and leaving certificate examinations, albeit in a restricted curriculum. Those students take great pride in their achievements.</P>
    <P>VECs have also been a pioneering force in the area of adult education. I welcome the fact that, under section 26, vocational education committees will be obliged to draw up a five year plan. If I have any criticism of the VEC system, about which I am passionate in terms of its ability to respond to local needs, it is that issues have often been addressed in an <i>ad hoc </i>manner and rationalised retrospectively. In regard to adult education, dynamic people, primarily volunteers, have tutored people with learning difficulties in their local communities on a one to one basis. The fact that the Government has published a White Paper on the subject further legitimises adult education and will finally put it in its proper place.</P>
    <P>The area of youth work has also been legitimised or will be in the near future. This is a further aspect of VEC provision which is not often publicised. Together with this Bill, the Children Bill and the youth work legislation will copperfasten this area and ensure the effective delivery of services to young people and adults alike.</P>
    <P>I compliment Omega, a young enterprise company from Finglas, which won an award yesterday. I expect it will represent Ireland in Moscow in October, following in the footsteps of previous companies in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. Like Deputy <Col N="51" /> Carey, the VEC is close to my heart as I have served on Leitrim VEC for some time. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to be the chairperson because Fine Gael did not have sufficient members on the committee. We will fight that battle another day.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals in the Bill as the democratisation of education is a laudable objective. My fundamental difficulty with the Bill is that those nominated for VEC membership &ndash; student representatives and representatives of voluntary and business organisations &ndash; must be approved by the local authority before being entitled to take up membership. This provision is unnecessary and the Minister should reconsider it prior to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>My criticism of the VEC system is that it is sometimes perceived as being abused by whatever political party has a majority on a committee. The Minister should not introduce legislation which gives local authority members a veto on the membership of VEC boards. A preferable option would be to allow student bodies, voluntary organisations and the business community to nominate representatives to boards. Nominees should not have to receive the blessing of politicians on local authorities who would not wish to have such powers or to have to make such decisions. If local authority members are asked to make such decisions, matters will become political and we are trying to avoid that problem.</P>
      <P>I was a member of County Leitrim VEC for some time but stood down after the last local elections. I am happy with the role played by vocational education committees in recent years. However, I question the process involving boards of selection. The general view of vocational education committees was that it did not matter how good a teacher was but which political party he or she followed. That was an undesirable situation. In the case of County Leitrim VEC, the majority political party incorrectly made appointments based on the fact that people were aligned to it. I am not just blaming Fianna Fáil as I have no doubt that other political parties could be accused of a similar practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will use the opportunity presented by the Bill to deal with the composition of selection boards. I have no difficulty with people from local vocational education committees being members of such boards. However, I experienced a situation in which a five member board, comprising four members of the VEC and an inspector, carried out interviews for a senior teaching position. Of the four VEC members, only two had a third level education. I am not suggesting that a third level education is necessary, but the other board members made decisions which many regarded as unfair. The board should comprise one member of the local VEC, one member of an outside VEC, the regional inspector and the chief executive officer or the principal of the school involved. This <Col N="52" /> would remove concerns about political bias in the VEC sector which still exist within the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>People running vocational schools regret that the Bill will result in a continuation of the domination of the membership of committees by political appointees. Staff representation is seen as inadequate. The Bill provides that two members of the VEC will be elected by staff. The staff of the VEC will consist of a number of categories including teachers, staff involved in administration, maintenance and youth services, adult education organisers, educational psychologists and principals and deputy principals. The two persons elected will represent the teaching staff, leaving all other categories unrepresented. I am concerned that some principals and deputy principals will not be represented, despite the fact that, together with the chief executive officers of vocational education committees, they have a legal responsibility for the performance of their duties. Many staff within the system may not be represented on these boards. I am not suggesting the membership of boards should be large and unmanageable, but this issue should be reconsidered before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 9(<i>e</i>) refers to the consultation process. vocational education committees will consult a number of groups. However, principals and deputy principals, who are responsible for running schools, are excluded from this process. They may be consulted but it would be preferable if the Bill provided that they must be consulted. Principals and deputy principals take an overall view on how schools and the school system should be run, and it would be wrong if the legislation does not provide that they have to be consulted. The Minister should consider this issue before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 16 allows the chief executive officer to delegate any functions performed by him or her to a member of staff. This is a broad provision and I would question whether this could mean that a chief executive officer could ask someone on the administrative staff to run a school for a day if the principal or deputy principal was unavailable. The wording of this section needs to be tightened to prescribe which categories of staff are regarded as appropriate to be delegated such tasks.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes new methods of reporting service plans, annual reports, education plans and other issues. However, resources have not been provided to facilitate this important work. We are wonderful at introducing well-meaning legislation without provided the necessary finance to carry out the work. The Minister must tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the funding of vocational education committees, but not of individual schools. There is much disquiet in the VEC sector that the level of funding for schools is not the same as for State schools in the community schools sector. There is no accountability in this matter. If I tabled a parliamentary question in this regard, the answer would probably be that it <Col N="53" /> is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant VEC, that he or she has to act within the constraints of funding made available and that schools are not allocated specific amounts of funding. Community schools are given a budget within which they have to operate. The Minister could consider this, although a number of chief executive officers would not be in favour of such a process because they would consider it a diminution of their position. However, administration might be easier if each school had its own budget and had to live within it. The chief executive officer could then deal with the many other aspects of vocational education in which the VEC is involved. I ask the Minister to respond to this suggestion in his reply.</P>
    <P>As many of my colleagues said, vocational education committees throughout the country have done excellent work in areas such as adult education, the education of the Traveller community and post leaving certificate courses. The visionary and voluntary work of the VEC sector with regard to adult education should be complimented, encouraged and congratulated. There are still problems in relation to literacy and the adult education system has played an important role in educating people in that regard over the years. This should be encouraged and I hope it will continue. I agree with my colleagues that adult education has been effective. Most vocational education committees run post leaving certificate courses and they are most welcome. It is a progressive idea and the courses give young people who may have had a difficulty with their leaving certificates an opportunity to continue in education. Such courses should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>A number of schools in County Leitrim are awaiting progress reports from the Minister for Education and Science. There are two schools in Mohill, County Leitrim &ndash; the Marian College and Mohill VEC. Due to the inadequate and dangerous buildings at the Marian College, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, announced that a new school would be built on the site. I understand the main reasons for this were that the structure of a number of the classrooms was inadequate and there were health and safety issues. The decision to demolish the classrooms was announced approximately 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>The decision to amalgamate the two secondary schools in one town was a departure from education policy. However, the matter has been the subject of ongoing discussion in Mohill and agreement has been reached between the two schools that a new school should be built on a site beside the Marian College provided by the Sisters of Mercy. However, the Minister must decide whether it will be a VEC run community school or a community college. Will the Minister make up his mind as a matter of urgency given that the buildings that were considered a health hazard two years ago are still in existence in the Marian College and children and teachers use the <Col N="54" /> classrooms every day? A decision by the Minister is awaited and I hope he will make it quickly.</P>
    <P>In my home town of Ballinamore, successful co-operation in second level education has evolved over the past 27 years. The local VEC school and the local secondary school for girls and boys have co-operated effectively and the only difficulty is that one school is located at the northern end of the town while the other is located at the southern end. This means students must walk the half mile, sometimes in inclement weather, from one classroom to another. Teachers and parents have requested the Department of Education and Science to consider building a new school in the town on a new site. The local community has provided a state of the art community hall and sports complex and I suggest the new school building should be located close to the new hall. This would ensure all the facilities are together. A decision by the Minister on that is awaited. He said he has no difficulty in principle with the building of a new school and we are awaiting a decision on whether it will be a community school or a community college. I ask the Minister to make an announcement on that matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the context of the education sector in general, it is a good idea to have students, voluntary organisations and the business community represented on VEC boards. The VEC system as it stands is the most democratic in the education sector. Why are the same measures not proposed for the primary and secondary sectors? It is imperative that students, parents, voluntary organisations and businesses are given a say in the running of the primary and secondary education sectors. The Bill is an ideal place to address this issue but, unfortunately, the Minister does not have the courage of his convictions. He is tinkering with the edges because the vocational education committees are easy to address. The changes should be general policy and I hope when the Bill is enacted the Minister will seriously consider implementing them in the primary and secondary sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to the management of schools throughout the country. The Minister's proposals relate to VEC education and schools, but there will be a fundamental change in school ownership and management in the next few years. On that basis, it is imperative that the Minister and his Department closely examine how the educational system operates, how it is managed and its ownership. In the past 20 years, there has been a significant reduction in the number of religious people available to teach in voluntary secondary schools. A number of schools run by either nuns or brothers have closed and in many cases the VEC was able to respond positively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five years ago in the town of Buttevant in my constituency, the numbers attending the local convent secondary school fell dramatically over a ten year period and it was forced to close. The <Col N="55" /> loss of a secondary school in a town of that size could have torn the heart out of the community and I was glad that the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, created an opportunity for County Cork VEC to take over the school. It was agreed on the basis of being an experiment for a two or three year period. Fortunately, as a result of the intervention of the excellently managed County Cork VEC and the support of the local community, the school has been a spectacular success to such an extent that a new school is proposed for Buttevant by the VEC. It is a an example of what can be done when the vocational education committees work closely in conjunction with local communities, parents and students. I hope there are other examples throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is a positive development because it shows how things have changed regarding the way the VEC system is viewed by parents and the wider community. Fifteen or 20 years ago VEC schools had a status problem in a number of towns, especially where there was a voluntary sector school in the area. It may have been due to the fact that the VEC sector concentrated more on technical and practical subjects rather than academic ones. There has been a fundamental change in perception as the subjects taught by the vocational education committees in the 1960s and 1970s have become necessary core subjects in the second level curriculum. The excellence, good management and vision shown by vocational education committees has placed their schools at the top of the education league. As a result the inferiority complex which many in the sector felt obliged to accept has disappeared. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>It is more than 70 years since the Cumann na nGaedheal Government led by William T. Cosgrave laid the foundation for the VEC system. That Government and Dáil, which formed the State and created the Garda Síochána and the Army, developed industry and started the process of modernisation and change, did a fine job in establishing the vocational education system. It was a very far seeing development in the late 1920s and early 1930s and it has stood the test of time. Many of the towns and students who had no prospect of access to a voluntary secondary school were facilitated by the development of second level VEC schools. It generated huge economic and social change and progress and educated tens of thousands of young people.</P>
    <P>However, the system needs to be modernised and changed. While the Bill does not provide all the necessary changes it is a positive and welcome initiative. I especially welcome the decision to give a greater role at VEC management level to parents and students. I agree with the views expressed by my party's spokesperson on Education, Deputy Creed, on the apparent veto which the vocational education committees may impose on the selection of parents and students. <Col N="56" /> Nevertheless, I support the concept of strong parental and student representation.</P>
    <P>Student representation is considered the norm at third level where student unions looking after the interests of third level students is taken for granted. Unfortunately, it was only during the recent industrial action in secondary schools, which affected leaving certificate students, that the possibility of student representation at second level emerged. This must be welcomed because the education system is designed to provide not for the parents or teachers but the students. It is, therefore, opportune and appropriate that students would be represented at VEC level in a fair and equal manner.</P>
    <P>I was a member of County Cork VEC from 1991 to 1999 when I was perhaps not much older than most of the students whose careers I was supposed to look after. I often considered it a weakness at VEC meetings that issues affecting students in a fundamentally important way were discussed with only second hand information on their views on any of the changes we proposed to introduce. I hope there will be a clear opportunity for students to have their voices heard at the policy making forum, which will take place at county VEC level.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Creed, has pointed out the danger of having a political veto over certain appointments at both parental and student level. That cannot be condoned. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the occasions when the local authority or VEC would not accept nominations by parents or students. If we want parents or students to nominate representatives to the VEC it should not be within the powers of the VEC or local authority to reject a nomination unless there are exceptionally good grounds for doing so. There is no indication in the legislation that such grounds are to be provided for. Perhaps the Minister will clarify this aspect.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the situation regarding interview boards. In County Cork I served on interview boards on more than a few occasions. I found the process very fair and transparent. Perhaps members of other vocational education committees have had different experiences. There is a need to address even the slightest doubts that may arise regarding the fairness of the interview system or favouritism, be it on political or other grounds. We need to put in place a system that is clearly seen to be fair and open.</P>
    <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act candidates, including unsuccessful ones, are entitled to access interview notes. That is to be welcomed. However, I understand this provision is causing difficulty for interview panels. Some of those involved in panels have advised me they no longer like to write notes on candidates because they do not want them read afterwards. There is a need to look at the make-up of interview boards. If there is a problem, even in only one county, it is one too many. We need to ensure <Col N="57" /> the system is seen to be fair, open, honest and transparent.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for co-operation between two or more vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>This is welcome. A county as large as Cork can, perhaps, carry out its business effectively, but other VEC boards would do well to reflect on the possibility of co-operating with adjoining vocational education committees. This would be particularly appropriate with regard to providing access to third level education and third level courses. We are moving away from the simplistic notion that third level education can only be provided in a university, regional college or institute of technology. We must aspire, in forthcoming years, to putting a system in place &ndash; the VEC system is the ideal vehicle for doing so &ndash; to ensure at least some amount of third level education is available in every large provincial town. There are many wasted classrooms and buildings within the VEC system. It should be possible to provide third level courses across a wide range of subjects in those facilities. There are great opportunities for a number of vocational education committees to come together and work to that end.</P>
    <P>Counties in the more peripheral areas of the country should work together to ensure VEC schools in their larger towns can provide a certain number of third level courses. Access to education must apply, not just regardless of financial means, but also of geographical location. I hope the vocational education committees, under the co-operation powers conferred by section 18, will make progress in that regard. The VEC system helped to transform Irish education since the 1930s and ensure that people throughout the country can access second level education of the highest standard. It now has a role to play in ensuring some amount of third level education is also available to students throughout the country from all backgrounds, regardless of parental income or geographical location. I hope section 18 will be seen in that light by the vocational education committees. It might not apply to large vocational education committees such as that in County Cork, but smaller vocational education committees could use the section to make progress.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look again at the number of vocational education committees. The sector has worked well, but the fact that 70 years after their establishment there has been no examination of amalgamation for some vocational education committees does not mean it should not happen. Our interest should be to ensure the best level of service for pupils. Some of the smaller vocational education committees might not have the facilities to operate as successfully as they could or should. This issue should be considered by the Department. The Minister does not claim to address all problems in the VEC system with this <Col N="58" /> Bill, but the fact that he ignores the issue of amalgamating some of the smaller vocational education committees means he is failing to address an important issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome. It marks a further step in the advancement of the VEC system, a system which has served the country well. I am particularly glad that parents and students will have better representation at decision making levels in an area which has such a huge effect on them. I hope the Minister will reflect on Deputy Creed's contribution and ensure there will be no political vetting or veto applied to the selection of students' and parents' representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Many speakers have referred to the legislation which established vocational education committees and vocational schools. The Vocational Education Act, 1930, was introduced by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. That Government was in office for a number of turbulent years during a difficult time. During its term of office it put together a tremendous range of services and, in effect, took the gun out of Irish politics. It put in place a number of institutions which have lasted extremely well. It also put in place legislation to provide that Secretaries of Departments were made accountable for what happened in their Departments.</P>
      <P>The Vocational Education Act was one of its legislative measures which has withstood the passage of time. However, the Minister who introduced the Act, former Deputy O'Sullivan, was, perhaps, a little naive about how some of the provisions might operate. He put in a place an elaborate procedure for the appointment of members to the VEC, but it was subsequently used and manipulated by certain vocational education committees in ways which were not to the benefit of the VEC, how it did its work and how it selected personnel.</P>
      <P>The county council in my constituency is dominated by the political party of which the Minister is a member. In the aftermath of the last three council elections, the party used the system provided for in the Vocational Education Act to maximise the number of people it could appoint to the VEC. There was no question of coming together with other groups and deciding who were the best people for the job. The party monopolised the places and filled them with people who had not been elected and so forth. That was a shame. It also reluctantly agreed to include teachers' and parents' representatives. The party was so mean about it that only one of each was elected in order that the party could maximise the number of its political representatives on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was sad, particularly when one considers what happened in 1985 and subsequently. The VEC appointed in Westmeath at that time <Col N="59" /> brought about one of the greatest scandals to occur within the vocational education system. It subsequently came to light that, for example, it bought property in France without ministerial approval. That was outside its jurisdiction. It also bought property in Delvin, County Westmeath. Subsequently, a petrol tank was discovered under the building. It was, therefore, unsafe to use for any purpose. The VEC had a petty cash account which was overdrawn by £900,000.</P>
    <P>A parents' group in Athlone ran bun sales, dances, walks and so forth to raise £25,000 to purchase a bus in order that the school could transport pupils to swimming and other activities. What did the enlightened chief executive officer of the day do? He mortgaged the bus to the bank and raised a loan of approximately £35,000. The money was used to improve kitchens and other facilities in the school, but there was no recourse to the tendering process and other procedures.</P>
    <P>All this came about because in 1985 the Fianna Fáil group on the VEC had its own chairperson in place. A decision was taken at the time that no further chief executive officers would be appointed to vocational education committees. However, it decided to appoint an acting or temporary chief executive officer. While there are very strict regulations on the appointment of a chief executive officer of a VEC, no such regulations govern the appointment of an acting chief executive officer. The committee had an eminent chairperson and she subsequently went on to do great things in this House and occupies a Front Bench position in this Dáil. She was chairperson of the VEC at the time and it decided on who should be chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>The nine Fianna Fáil members arranged to have a meeting at which eight turned up. There were two nominees for the position, both of whom happened to be Fianna Fáil councillors. The vote was split at four all. On the casting vote of the chairperson, the acting chief executive officer was appointed and from that came the difficulties which emerged within the VEC. While the legislation worked well in most areas, it was manipulated in some which led to some vocational education committees being given a bad name. That said, the corruption which existed within the organisation at the time fortunately did not spread to schools within its remit. They operated extremely well and the dedicated teachers in them did a tremendous job. Those schools are a credit to those teachers and their principals.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Vocational Education Act, 1930, we must mention the advance made in further education in the late 1970s in the form of regional technical colleges, subsequently renamed institutes of technology. They came under the jurisdiction of vocational education committees. It is interesting that the legislation designed in the 1930s was able to accommodate <Col N="60" /> the establishment of those colleges, albeit with some amendments. The institutes of technology have since removed themselves from the VEC system. Perhaps the institutes were not happy dealing with the vocational education committees, but the committees did serve them well for a long time and that worked well.</P>
    <P>There are a number of thorny issues in the VEC system, the greatest of which is, perhaps, the rationalisation of schools. Some small towns have two or three schools and the population is not sufficient to sustain that. If a school is to provide a full range of services and subjects, it needs to have about 500 pupils. That is the break even number for offering a variety of subjects, careers advice and so on. While rationalisation has fallen into place quite easily in some places and great progress has been made, there are major difficulties in some areas. The Department needs to give a tremendous lead in this area. It needs to put in some of its best people to resolve those difficulties. It is not fair on pupils and wrong that they will lose out while discussions on rationalisation are ongoing. Some cases take years to resolve. Will the Minister of State examine the trouble spots and identify three or four roving diplomats, so to speak, who will be in a position to draw groups together and make recommendations on rationalisation to bring it to fruition?</P>
    <P>There is nothing as bad for an area as uncertainty about a school. If there is uncertainty about which school will close, the result will be pupils being bussed out of the area to another school. They will often be the good students and it will create an atmosphere that one must go out of town to get a better education. That is not right and the Minister of State should take note of it.</P>
    <P>Funding is another issue which must be examined. There is a great deal of debate, difficulty and ill-feeling about the level of funding in different second level schools. Voluntary secondary schools feel hard done by and believe VEC schools get a much better deal and have permanent caretakers and secretaries. Voluntary secondary schools receive block grants to cover those and cannot afford the same cover because of the level of funding. They feel hard done by and believe it is unfair. It is unjust if one assumes all children of the nation must be treated equally. Equal funding should be given to the different types of schools for their operations. The Minister of State might say vocational education committees cater for further and adult education. They do a great job in the cases with which I am familiar.</P>
    <P>An example is, Coláiste Cionn Torc, the local vocational school in Castlepollard, County Westmeath, in which 150 students are enrolled and 180 adults are registered for further education in various courses. There is a great air of success about the fact that adult education is seen to be important in the area and that many adults <Col N="61" /> will further their education. Many of the additional studies are in the information technology sector.</P>
    <P>While that is welcome, the sad aspect to it is that an extension and possible new building for the school was approved in 1987, 14 years ago and before I was elected to the House. It was given priority status in 1996 by the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, but a site has only now been bought for a new school. Little else has happened and it is very sad that Fianna Fáil dominated Governments since 1987 have not progressed this.</P>
    <P>An eminent Senator lives in the town a stone's throw from the school. It is interesting to hear him speak of his commitment to the area but he has failed to progress the project. There will be a great deal of huffing and puffing on his part in the run up to the general election with him declaring what he has done for the school, but the record speaks for itself. It was approved in 1987 and a site has only been bought now with planning permission obtained. The project needs money to be progressed. Perhaps the Minister of State can bring that project forward and give it priority so that the children in the area will get the opportunity they deserve.</P>
    <P>Another item which deserves mention is the processing of higher education grants. It has always fallen on deaf ears, even when my party was in Government, when I have said that the processing of such grants needs to be streamlined. There was a proposal to centralise them at one stage. I do not agree with that. They should be centralised locally. There should be one body processing higher education grants in a county, be it the county council or the vocational education committee. I am sure the Chair has the same problems in his busy constituency as I have. A person will tell me queries have been raised about his son's grant application and will ask if there is anything I can do about it. I contact the county council to be told the application was not made to it and was possibly made to the VEC.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of confusion and people do not know where to apply to. That is why grant application processing should be centralised locally. It would ensure a standardised approach to the processing of applications. There are 74 processing bodies for higher education grants. That is ridiculous for the size of the population. Perhaps the Minister of State will bear that in mind. Perhaps she might also bear in mind that the processing of higher education grants within the VEC system is paid for by the Department whereas the processing within county councils is not paid for at all. That is not fair. Why should that be? Why should it not be the same approach across the board?</P>
    <P>The Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill introduces many worthwhile improvements. Five year plans must be made within vocational education committees. This is welcome and worth<Col N="62" /> while. Annual reports are also welcome. I hope these reports do not become mere prospectuses for vocational education committees, full of glossy photographs of high profile local people. They should promote education and set out what is happening within it.</P>
    <P>Section 19 controls expenditure and is particularly welcome in the light of the Westmeath experience. It says vocational education committees must operate within the expenditure limits set down by the Minister. Over the years a number of vocational education committees spent money they did not have and had to be rescued by the Minister. Millions of pounds were paid to vocational education committees which had overspent. Approximately 15 vocational education committees erred in this regard and County Westmeath VEC was one of these. One might wonder why the Department should come to the rescue of these vocational education committees. Is it fair that a VEC should be rescued when it overspends? That is a large debate for another occasion. Section 19 deals with this area and obliges vocational education committees to operate within their budgets. If they do not, their budgets for the following year will be reduced accordingly. I welcome this new regulation.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of parents and teachers on vocational education committees is worthwhile. It is time this representation was placed on a statutory footing. However, I am concerned about the representation of students. The Bill does not guarantee the presence of students on the committees. Students will be among the nominating bodies but other members of the vocational education committees will choose the actual representatives. This might exclude important student voices from vocational education committees. We heard extremely articulate second level students being interviewed during the recent teachers' dispute. Such students would have an important role to play within the VEC system. We should strengthen the legislation so that specific places are reserved for students on vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that regulations can be made by the Minister and laid before the House and that those regulations will become law unless they are annulled by the House. In recent times attempts have been made to change that negative system. The Minister should be obliged to get the agreement of the House for the regulations to come into force rather than wait for someone to put down a motion of annulment. It would be more appropriate for regulations to be laid before the House for its approval. This would be a more positive approach.</P>

      <P>I join colleagues in welcoming the Bill and I am glad to make a contribution to it. Deputy McGrath has referred to the involvement of students in the newly composed vocational <Col N="63" /> education committees, as set out in the legislation. The legislation does not make it clear whether students will now be part of the newly composed bodies. Section 7 places the responsibility for bringing forward students who may or may not become members of the VEC on the local authority. This is a retrograde step. The biggest interest in the vocational education committees is that of the pupils. The controversy of the recent student protests highlighted this issue. A huge constituency of well motivated, articulate young people had much to say about education. Much of what they said was positive and did not merely consist of ranting and raving. The voice of this constituency was expressed during the recent student demonstrations which followed the Government's handling of the teachers' dispute. This legislation does not recognise this constituency.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the rights of teachers, parents and the local authority to be represented on vocational education committees have been set out in law but this right is not being extended to pupils. They will be considered. Section 7 says they will be considered &ldquo;from among persons nominated by such bodies as, in the opinion of the council concerned, are representative of students&rdquo;. This must be changed on Committee Stage. The Bill does not give students recognition on the new vocational education committees as of right.</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with the new functions to be ascribed to vocational education committees. This section sets out in law the right of vocational education committees to assess themselves and state that one of the functions of a VEC will be to assess whether &ldquo;the manner in which it performs its functions is economical, efficient and effective&rdquo;. This is a bad move. We cannot repeat what happened in County Westmeath. There must be an independent monitoring system, either by one VEC of another or by the private sector. We are loath to introduce independent assessment of the performance of schools, vocational education committees and other educational institutions. We need to build upon this area. If we are to provide economical, efficient and effective performance by vocational education committees this performance cannot be assessed by the people whose performance is being assessed. It must be done by an independent body. I encourage the Minister to respond to this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome section 21 which deals with the service plan. The Minister is proposing that a service plan &ldquo;shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Minister may determine&rdquo;. We need to put this in law and the Minister needs to spell out exactly what he wants in a service plan. From my brief knowledge of the House in the few years I have been a Member, I am aware that we <Col N="64" /> regularly pass legislation which does not describe exactly what we want in the final product. We give considerable powers to Ministers to make up their minds as they may determine. It is a matter for the House which should have the final say as to what ends up in the service plans. The issue should be debated on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many colleagues have rightly paid tribute to the work of the vocational education committees since they were first established in 1930. Most regard them as flexible institutions in dealing with educational needs within a local area and in providing a community focus. The community colleges which have been established directly under the vocational education committees have shown the way to involve the wider community in education. There is a much more approachable, democratic structure within community colleges, for instance, than in other secondary schools. We should continue to focus on this and replicate it in other sectors. Many sectors of education can learn a great deal from the vocational education committees. Unfortunately, however, we have this kind of pitched warfare from time to time that takes place between various sections of education, with no one learning from the other. This must change.</P>
    <P>One of the most radical departures for the VEC structure in recent years was the establishment and expansion of post-leaving certificate, or PLC, courses. In the Dublin area they have made a huge difference to the quality of third level courses now being provided for students, which are directly linked to the needs of industry and lead to jobs at the end of the process. I urge the Government to give students who undertake arduous examinations and are part of the PLC structure the resources to remain in college. Currently, a flexible labour market provides incentives that encourage people not to take up PLC courses on offer. The Government has not been judicious about this matter and has not provided financial support for students who need to stay in college. That is the case throughout the education system, whether it involves PLCs, institutes of technology or universities. Students are, therefore, finding it difficult to make ends meet. The lure of industry means that big money can be earned by 18, 19 or 20 year olds and, consequently, people do not want to pursue these courses. When the economy goes the other way, however, and the cycle is on the downside, these are the very same jobs that will be lost. It is essential, therefore, to support the work of vocational education committees by providing adequate financial support for students who wish to remain in third level education of one form or another.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of vocational education committees has been the extension of Youthreach programmes throughout the country. I congratulate all the teachers and administrators working within these programmes. Recently, I had an <Col N="65" /> opportunity to visit a Youthreach programme in Killinarden in Tallaght in my own constituency. They are picking up children who have fallen through the system. It is to the VEC's credit that Youthreach has been such a fantastic success.</P>
    <P>Many children dropping out of secondary education have nowhere to turn. On 2 May, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science in which I asked him if he could tell me the number of children who had been expelled or suspended from all secondary schools for each of the past five years, but he could not. We are supposed to be putting in place laws and regulations to deal with this area, yet we do not have the relevant information for the past five years. The Youthreach programme provided by County Dublin VEC and in other parts of the country provides the exact care, tuition and help required by children who fall through the system. The Department of Education and Science, however, cannot tell us how many children have been expelled or suspended from secondary schools in the past five years. In his reply on 2 May, the Minister said, &ldquo;As expulsion from school is a matter for each school authority, my Department has no information on the number of pupils who may have been expelled over the past five years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a growing problem of school expulsions, although we all understand the reason schools have to expel students. There is no institution or person, however, intervening with the families of those children in order to help them. Unless politicians provide direct help, there is nothing else there, apart from Youthreach which does a fantastic job. A child can be expelled from school and may be sitting at home or doing some work at 14, 15 or 16 years of age, yet no one from the Department of Education and Science is following up the matter. The scant resources available are not being provided for direct intervention in such cases.</P>
    <P>Youthreach is a model programme and I support its work which has had a huge impact on the lives of children who have gone astray. We need to introduce all such children to the work of Youthreach, but this is not happening. The Education Welfare Bill is providing some initiatives in this area, but it is not good enough. One of the big problems in education that we are failing to deal with concerns the number of children not just dropping out of school, but being expelled from the system. We have not put in place a structure to monitor the number of children involved, or any kind of formal links between their educational and training needs and wider family problems in such cases.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with an issue that came to my attention this week in my constituency involving the number of qualified teachers in our schools. It relates directly to vocational education committees as much as any other aspect of education <Col N="66" /> and, specifically, those schools in disadvantaged areas. It is becoming increasingly difficult for local national and secondary schools of all descriptions in disadvantaged communities to retain teachers. I will cite one example from a letter I received from a school principal earlier this week, although I will not name the establishment concerned. The total allocation of teachers in the school is 32. Of this number, 25 are qualified, five have no qualifications whatsoever, yet they are teaching, and there are two unfilled posts. We must deal with this problem. It is becoming increasingly difficult to attract teachers to disadvantaged communities to work either at primary or secondary level and keep them in those schools because of the difficult circumstances they face. The Government should urgently bring forward a package of measures to help retain teachers in disadvantaged schools and attract new teachers. Such a package is necessary. From my conversations with a particular school principal in my constituency, I am aware of the frustrations which exist at board of management level, in the staff room and among parents due to the fact that it is impossible to keep qualified teachers in the schools.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline a number of proposals to address the above problem. Teachers who work in disadvantaged communities should receive a top-up on their basic pay because the problems they face, if not unique, are quite different to those experienced in schools in other communities. Teachers who remain in a school in a disadvantaged area for five years should be entitled to six months' or a year's paid leave to recompense them for the time and effort expended in dealing with a variety of problems in that school.</P>
    <P>It is essential that a greater degree of flexibility is introduced to ensure teacher numbers are maintained at high levels in disadvantaged communities. The school to which I refer, whose name I will not mention, takes in children from a primary school in which the Breaking the Cycle scheme operates and in which the pupil/teacher ratio is 15:1. When those children enter second level, they encounter a pupil/teacher ratio of 30:1. We are aware from St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and the excellent work carried out under the Breaking Cycle Scheme that children's numeracy and literacy skills are enhanced by a small and focused classroom environment. It is very difficult to encourage students in disadvantaged communities to proceed to third level and to provide them with life chances similar to those afforded to students in other parts of society. It is imperative, therefore, that we maintain teacher numbers to ensure the optimum pupil/teacher ratio in these schools and introduce a package of measures which will attract the best teachers into them.</P>
    <P>On the social services side, there are 13 fewer social workers in the area in which the above <Col N="67" /> school is located than in similar areas. It is increasingly difficult to attract qualified, highly motivated teachers into disadvantaged communities because it is virtually impossible to provide them with the type of flexibility they require to avoid burn-out.</P>
    <P>I concur with the point made by Deputy McGrath in regard to the establishment of a local processing body for higher education grants which would bring together the grants and supports offered by the VEC and those provided by the local authority. People are completely confused about how and where they should apply for these grants and I urge the Minister to address this confusion.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. My comments on student representation, the service plan and its accountability to this House should be embodied in Government amendments on Committee Stage. I would certainly support any such amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this progressive legislation. The VEC sector has served Ireland extraordinarily well. I represent a county in which the VEC is the biggest provider of second level education of a quite superior standard. The VEC seems to be particularly capable of dealing with current challenges such as VTOS and other local initiatives. County Wicklow VEC has a remarkable range of services in its remit, an example of which is the arts support it provides.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to revise the composition of the vocational educational committees to include mandatory parent and staff representation. That is eminently sensible. I also concur with the view that student representation should be provided for. There are certain ambiguities in regard to the issue of representation, not just in vocational education committees but also on boards of management. The Department does not seem capable of offering any clarity on these matters. There is currently a controversial case in my constituency in which a group of people who are not members of the parents' group are attempting to remove parent representatives, as a result of which an excellent school will suffer. Institutional arrangements must be put in place in a new environment to deal with the challenges which arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VEC system requires modernisation and innovation. I welcome the progressive provisions in regard to the preparation of an education plan. That should be stipulated in legislation. I am, however, concerned that we will again split a VEC's functions into reserved and executive functions. That has happened since the 1920s. The idea that policy and its implementation are divisible is mythical. Policy and its implementation is a continuum, not a dichotomy. I hope the splitting of functions will not result in similar destructive forces entering the VEC system as have entered the local authority system in recent <Col N="68" /> years whereby elected representatives deeply resent the oppressive role played by management from time to time.</P>
    <P>By and large, chief executive officers have operated very well in the VEC system but I would not like to see a greater proportion of power being vested in them than in VEC members who represent a great deal of common sense. There is an adage to the effect that if one gives people too much power, it will go to their heads and have a destructive force. A balance must be struck in this area and I do not believe sufficient time or effort has been devoted to considering the potentially damaging impact of a lack of balance in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions relating to reporting, accounting and financial procedures are well recognised and are needed. Deputy McGrath made reference to the adventures in Westmeath, for example, and there were one or two other cases in which it was suggested that some accounting and financial procedures were not dealt with properly, so these legislative steps are welcome in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to make a final point. I am sure it was not intentional but there has been some disservice to the vocational education committees in the debate because the old myth which is regularly trotted out about the VEC system of appointing teachers being subject to abuse was again trotted out on a number of occasions. As on the previous occasion a number of years ago when we had a similar debate in this House, there was a remarkable lack of evidence produced to support that particular thesis. Indeed, one or two speakers today made the point that they believed the system was potentially open to abuse but went on to make it absolutely clear that they had involved themselves in committees of selection at VEC level and that, in their particular vocational education committees, all was as pure as the driven snow.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a requirement to bring this particular arid debate to an end. It is a debate which is ultimately destructive. I have been a member of a VEC for approximately 15 years. I was a member of an Regional Technical College board before that and as a public representative, I have always refused to serve on those boards because I believe there is something wrong about that selection process. If there was to be an addition to the Bill I would like to see a more professional selection process introduced, not because there has been any systematic or systemic abuse but because there have been individual instances from time to time which were exaggerated out of all proportion. They do some disservice to the vocational education committees, to the people who serve on the VEC selection boards and to teachers. That is something we should address on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> Overall, this is good legislation. It tries to modernise and it will bring about some incremental changes in the VEC system which has served us well. We do not serve the VEC system well if we exaggerate. The VEC system is flexible and, as Deputy Hayes said, it could be adopted to other schools. The Deputy made the point that the Minister could not say how many students had been expelled from schools &ndash; we are not supposed to use the word &ldquo;expelled&rdquo; any more &ndash; or subject to disciplinary action. It is bizarre when the Department of Education and Science cannot provide those details but those details could not have been provided five, ten or even 15 years ago by the Department because of the system that existed. The VEC system offers a democratic model which has served us well and which could and will be improved by this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister I would like to thank all Deputies for their observations on the provisions of the Bill. The level of interest and attention to detail shown by Deputies in their consideration of the Bill is indicative of the pivotal role played by vocational education committees in education provision to date and I anticipate further constructive debate on Committee Stage. At this stage, however, I would like to respond on behalf of the Minister to a number of key issues raised.</P>
      <P>The Minister has noted the point raised by Deputies Creed and Shortall in relation to the Title of the Bill and the use of the term &ldquo;vocational education&rdquo;. In a changing world it is right that our institutions, behaviours and even our titles should change, reflecting new emphases and new ways of doing traditional tasks. However, no process of change should be entered into lightly. In the case of the vocational education sector, it is well to remember what a change would mean.</P>
      <P>Vocational education committees are a fundamental part of our education system. As the Minister said at the beginning of the debate, they were established at a time when the State was in its infancy. They began the provision of second level education at a time when it was the preserve of the few. Through successive decades they have continued to offer this education but also have been at the forefront of change in our system. The VEC sector led the way in the development of local colleges of education, which developed into regional institutes, which are today the institutes of technology, a crucial and progressive element of our third level sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In second level education today, VEC schools have been to the fore in embracing the new ideas of transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programmes offering new opportunities for second level students to learn in a manner and structure that <Col N="70" /> suits their needs. Based on such innovation, the title &ldquo;VEC&rdquo; is today associated with a commitment to provide for a modern education and a desire to continually meet the changing needs of students. I would be wary lest such an image might be lost amidst the inevitable confusion which might accompany any change of name.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any demand from the partners for a change to be made in the title of the sector. I know that for the partners too, the existing name has become very much part of their own operation, for example, in the titles of Irish Vocational Education Association or the Parents Association for Vocational Schools. However, the Minister accepts the principle that change can often be good, perhaps to reflect existing change or to lay a signal of an organisation's own commitment to change. One solution that offers itself at this time might be the introduction of an amendment to allow for a name change to be made by regulation by the Minister following consultation with all the interested parties. I understand the Minister will consider that matter further.</P>
    <P>Deputies Creed and Shortall both referred to the desirability of extending the principle of partnership to all schools. This Government has made such a principle one of our central objectives in all education legislation. One crucial instance is the Education Act, 1998, which expressly provides, in section 14, that schools should be managed in a spirit of partnership. Further sections of the Act make provision for the involvement of students and parents in the affairs of the school. Another important instance is the national education welfare board, to be set up under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. This board, which will be established shortly, also provides that all the partners in education &ndash; teachers, parents and managers &ndash; will have a seat on the board to ensure their full involvement in the tackling of a key component of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the views of the Deputies on the reintroduction of the regional education boards proposed by the previous Government. This Government was not prepared to see the diversion of millions of pounds of educational investment diverted into bureaucratic structures with so many other needs in education. What this Government has sustained are huge increases in investment to a total of £3.7 billion this year in all sectors of education since taking office, increases which are channelled directly into the classroom.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the recent examination of the operation of the Department by Mr. Séan Cromien, an examination undertaken at the Minister's invitation. Mr. Cromien's report has highlighted a number of areas in the Department where action might be taken to improve and streamline services, and the Minister is currently considering the implications of such recommendations. I understand the Minister is committed to <Col N="71" /> the ongoing reform of the Department and will report back further to this House when such changes are agreed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has noted Deputies Creed's and Shortall's comments on the membership of vocational education committees as proposed by the Bill. The intention in the Bill is to maintain the traditional model of partnership between vocational education committees and the local community and to allow for further dedicated representation for the parents of students attending VEC schools and for the staff of the VEC. The Bill also allowed for a further and wider category of representation on the VEC to include persons drawn from voluntary groups, the business community and students. On balance, I am happy that the provisions of the Bill, as they stand, allow for meaningful representation on the committees, giving full expression to the principle of partnership that has underpinned the success of this sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall suggested extending the principle of partnership to the sub-committees of vocational education committees. Sub-committees, however, tend to have a particular and limited task. Their membership tends to be drawn with a view to meeting some technical problem or particular challenge. As such, it is an area where decisions should be left to individual vocational education committees in respect of the individual issues they will face.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shortall and Creed also raised the issues of rationalisation of the VEC sector. The rationalisation model has been discussed at great length, both in this House and in other places. Indeed, much rationalisation has taken place.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will be anxious to deal with other matters Deputies have raised on Committee Stage, and he looks forward to that.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received confirmation from Eircom that it has opted out of the £37 million programme in the national development plan to upgrade telecommunications and digital infrastructure in the Border, midlands and western region; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13302/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): I have received confirmation from Eircom that the company has decided not to proceed with this project. Under national development plan co-funding, Eircom was offered funding of up to 12.4 million for an overall investment plan of 36.7 million. The project's objective was to extend Eircom's national infrastructure by providing fibre optics and digital subscriber line technologies to the Border, midlands and western region and the south and east region. Eircom was offered this contract under the first round of funding announced in January of this year.</P>
    <P>Under such a contract, Eircom would have received up to 12.4 million in national development plan support, with a total project cost of 36.7 million. Through the contract, Eircom would have been supported, by the Exchequer and the European Regional Development Fund in providing DSL technology. This technology would have enhanced Internet access in many parts of regional Ireland. In particular this technology would have allowed for high-speed Internet access at a small business and residential level. However, Eircom has decided not to proceed with the contract. Apparently, this is the result of a review of capital infrastructure within the company.</P>
    <P>I will continue to support a broad range of communications infrastructure projects under the national development plan. A total of 55 million was allocated under the national development plan to nine different broadband roll-out projects in January of this year. My Department, in association with Forfás, is currently evaluating regional disparities in telecommunications service provision and pricing. The results of this evaluation will feed into proposals I will bring forward in the near future in respect of the moneys which have not been taken up by Eircom.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister realise how devastating a blow this has been for the Border, midlands and western region? This infrastructural project was viewed as crucial from the point of view of bridging the digital divide between Dublin and the remainder of the coun<Col N="74" /> try. In fairness, the Government agreed to make available 12 million of the 37 million required. However, Eircom has suddenly decided to pull out. Has the Minister met representatives of Eircom to see if the company's decision can be reversed? What rationale is Eircom applying in this instance, apart from the fact that it appears to want to tighten its belt? Is it simply preparing for a further take-over by the bidders who are abroad in the marketplace? What plan has the Government to make up the deficit or to put in place an alternative plan? We cannot allow the situation to continue where one part of the country has the most modern ASD services and fibre optic cable, while the other part has literally nothing.</P>

      <P>I was appalled when Eircom announced its decision. Funding for the project was allocated by the group which considered the applications and it appeared that Eircom's application was very good. I did not meet representatives of Eircom but my officials have been in discussions with them. Apparently, the financial director requested people's ideas about Internet access and called in media firms, etc., and the result was what appeared in the company's application.</P>
      <P>There remain a huge number of other projects which, thankfully, have not dropped out of the race. When we advertised and received applications, there were many projects which did not obtain funding. Ironically, those responsible for the projects in question have proceeded with their work and want to expand it. We intend to approach the next applicant company on the list and offer it the funding that has been returned. There are projects already in train and awaiting funding; it is merely a matter of proceeding with allocation. Some of the projects which are apparently doing well or which, at least, want to extend their operations are situated in the midlands region, Longford, Kerry and other areas. It is not my place to offer an opinion on what will be the result of cheese-paring, but that is the type of activity in which Eircom has engaged.</P>

While the other plans and schemes to which the Minister referred are fine in that they make some reference to the west, the <Col N="75" /> programme in question was specific to the Border, midlands and western region. Will the Government, as a matter of urgency, enter discussions with Eircom on this matter? If that means making up the balance in terms of funding, so be it. We will simply not be at the races in terms of job creation unless the required telecommunications infrastructure is put in place. If that means increasing the funding from 12 million to 37 million, let us do so. The gap is wide enough at present. We will fall hopelessly behind unless we put in place the proper telecommunications infrastructure. I plead with the Minister to take action on this matter.</P>

      <P>I agree that we cannot allow a digital divide to develop. However, Eircom has taken a decision at board level and regardless of the number of discussions we have with its representatives, it will not reverse that decision. Many of the companies on the list of those awaiting funding are situated in the Border, midlands and western region and are proceeding with their operations. Eircom has taken a firm decision. I am aware that my officials spoke with its representatives because this decision was a source of major disappointment. This is despite the fact that money was returned to us and can now be reallocated within the relevant subhead. At present, the officials are considering how best to reallocate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt in detail with the approval process for the ESB-Statoil plant at Ringsend in the reply which I gave to two parliamentary questions in February of last year. In that reply I indicated that, in light of the significant competition issues arising which were con<Col N="76" /> veyed to me from Europe, I exercised my statutory functions in relation to the ESB-Statoil proposal, at all times, on the basis of legal advice.</P>
      <P>The ESB gave notice in 1998 of its intention to build a large gas fired generating station at Ringsend. The necessary approval process was initiated immediately, leading to approval in November 1998 for capital expenditure on the preparatory work up to completion of the planning process. On 1 December 1999, on the basis of legal advice from the AG, I published a letter which set out the conditions under which the next stage of approval for further capital expenditure by the ESB would be furnished. Approval for a further tranche of capital expenditure followed on 23 December 1999 and approval for the final tranche issued on 26 May 2000. The ESB applications for each tranche of capital expenditure were processed expeditiously by the Department.</P>
      <P>The ESB's decision to lease a number of stand-by generators for use last winter was an operational decision designed to give the company flexibility in meeting peak demand. The cost involved for the leasing of five units from General Electric was £10.5 million and the necessary works involving civil construction, mechanical and electrical installations, etc., cost £8.5 million.</P>

      <P>There is a sum of £41 million because the money the Minister spent last year and the money she will spend next year on mobile generators is £41 million, according to the figures she gave us. Does the Minister agree there is a huge gap between the requirement of this country <Col N="77" /> for electricity and the generating capacity? Two-thirds of the land mass of the Republic, particularly the midlands, the Border regions and the west, cannot accept any new large users of electricity, such as a large factory. Does she agree that not only do we not have generating capacity but that if we had, we would not have a transmission system to transmit the electricity from the generating stations to the users? We are using a 40 to 50 year old creaking transmission system which is not capable of transmitting electricity. Given that all the privateers who were supposed to arrive at our door when the market was opened have disappeared &ndash; the only one which stayed is sorry it did &ndash; what plans does the Minister have to supply sufficient electricity generating capacity and a transmission system to take the electricity to the midlands, the Border regions and the west where it is needed? </P>

      <P>My Department has received the final report on Dublin Airport commissioned from the consultants. This final report has been produced following consultation on its conclusions with the users of Dublin Airport. The report states that my decision to designate Dublin Airport as co-ordinated and to appoint Airports Co-ordinated Limited as co-ordinator at Dublin Airport was fully justified. It also states that Dublin Airport does not need to be fully co-ordinated at present. However, the report points out that the success of the airport's current voluntary co-ordination arrangements depends on the airlines at Dublin Airport co-operating with the co-ordinator. The report recommends that the situation at Dublin Airport should be kept under review. This report has been conveyed to the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which now has responsibility for airport slots, and is available on the commission's website.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister accept that the situation at Dublin Airport is still chaotic and sometimes a mess? Is she aware, for example, that on Tuesday morning at 8.30, when I was leaving one of my kith and kin back at Dublin Airport, there was a queue three deep which stretched for almost 100 yards? There were between 200 and 300 people in it. What type of welcome is it in the Ireland of 2001 to ask business people who have flown across the world from Japan and other places in the Far East or from the United States to queue for a taxi for an hour or an hour and a half? I checked the waiting time. Does she accept we must be the only capital city in the world with an airport of such a size which does not have a second terminal? I do not hold a brief for Ryanair or anyone else in terms of a second terminal. Is it time to look at our land usage and the possibility of a second terminal, perhaps opening on to the M50? We must do something to decongest Dublin Airport which caters for 13 to 14 million passengers at present and it is predicted that figure will rise to 20 million in the next four or five years. We need a root and branch re-examination of our attitude to terminal space and the use of available land.</P>

As regards the taxis, I do not know how many were in a taxi queue.

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bio-fuel and bio-energy derived from crops has the attraction of being a renewable form of energy, and of having relatively benign emissions, low toxicity and biodegradability. However, while investigation of the use of bio-fuel and bio-energy technologies has been ongoing over many years, it is widely acknowledged that further research and development is required before the technologies are commercially exploitable in this country. In the case of such fuels for transport, for example, the principal barrier is economic, arising from the costs of growing, harvesting and processing the fuel.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on sustainable energy, which was published by me in September, 1999, calls for the investigation and testing of alternative fuels, new technologies and innovative systems. More recently, the national climate change strategy, published in October, 2000 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has restated the call for measures to limit the rate of increase in overall fuel consumption and the need to encourage a switch to alternative, cleaner and more carbon efficient fuels.</P>
      <P>I have secured funding of £146 million under the national development plan for energy related expenditure including more than £40 million for a programme of energy research and development. The funding, to be administered by the Irish Energy Centre, will be used to support activities in this area using a mixture of approaches including, a public good fully funded research programme in co-operation with universities and research institutions, a shared cost research and development programme to be carried out with industry to exploit commercial opportunities, and international collaborative research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development of alternative forms of energy such as bio-fuels and bio-energy will feature under one or more of these approaches. The Irish <Col N="81" /> Energy Centre, which is co-funded by my Department, is currently preparing a three-year research and development work programme covering a number of sectors, with the objective of contributing towards the achievement of the most effective solutions to Irish needs at least cost. The programme will be funded as part of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme.</P>
    <P>The successful development of these energy sources will require a degree of co-ordination between growers, processors and the fuel industry. They remain promising technologies in an Irish and wider context. However, until the high production cost of these alternative forms of energy are reduced they will continue to have a limited impact on the overall energy market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that last winter there was a severe shortage of refined petroleum across Europe? In this context, it is important that Ireland develops alternative sources of energy. Does the Minister of State agree that from an environmental perspective it is desirable that we speed up the development of such alternative sources of petroleum and bio-fuel? Will he agree that a programme of three to five years is far too long and that we need to accelerate this? What plans has the Minister of State to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy as to the urgency of developing renewable energy. The Government is working on that but is using tried, tested and proven technologies such as wind energy to produce electricity. The Deputy will know that we have trebled the target for renewable energy and we will have a further 500 megawatts of renewable, mostly wind, energy by 2005. Renewable sources will then produce more than 12% of our energy. Other renewable sources are being looked at and need to be looked at. The technologies have some way to go. Research and development must be carried out. The plans and the funding are in place for that research and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in countries such as Brazil this is already being done? The technology exists, but what is lacking is the political will. Is it not true that a sugar company recently investigated the manufacture of a bio-fuel, ethanol, but there was no encouragement from the Government to co-ordinate the plan properly? Last winter there was a danger that Ireland might run out of refined petroleum. The government's rush to sell the Whitegate refinery should be looked at very carefully given the lack of a bio-fuel alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The main barrier is economic. There is also confusion about the environmental benefits of the fuels mentioned by Deputy Stanton. Although information is available about the <Col N="82" /> use of the fuels and their performance compared to fossil fuels, there is little emphasis globally on the benefits of producing fuels from renewable sources. While engine manufacturers have acted as assessors of bio-diesel, there is still debate over the fuels' performance under certain conditions. Therefore, a common European standard is necessary to ensure public confidence and to ensure the thrust for what will hopefully be an effective source of renewable energy.</P>

A number of new witnesses had come forward and the investigators had received significant co-operation. They met Deputy O'Shea and other Members, but that was only one element of the investigation. They met many others and are receiving co-operation from all quarters when they make queries, visits and take their findings. The investigation is proceeding. We expected the final report in April, but when the investigators sought more time to complete the it, we acceded to the request because the report will be all the better for it.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am satisfied that the investigators seem to be arriving at conclusions which are somewhat different from the original assumptions. All we had up to now was guesswork and assumptions. With regard to the procedures for the presentation of the report, we accept that the Minister and her officials should have first sight of it followed by the relatives of those who tragically died off Tuskar Rock in the <i>St. Phelim</i>, as a matter of courtesy. When that has happened will the Minister place the report before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport to be followed by an oral presentation by the investigators in order that we can have a detailed dialogue regarding the contents of the report and tease it out further?</P>

      <P>That would be a good idea. When the Deputy asked me about the report, I said that it challenged some of the assumptions which had been made in the earlier review. I do not know what those are because I have not received the final report. I will bring the report to Cabinet, as I did the earlier review, and will meet the relatives to give it to them and then make it public. It would be a good idea to present it to a committee and ask the investigators if they, in turn, could attend and give a précis of their report and answer queries.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is interesting and timely. I am pleased to inform him that at a meeting in my Department last week agreement was reached with the family of the late pilot captain and their legal advisers on the format, timescale, etc., of a structured review of the case. The review is expected to commence early next month.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed that it was necessary to consult the proposed senior counsel who would carry out the review as to the format, timescale, etc., before those matters would be finalised. Broadly speaking, however, the review will address two principal questions:</P>
      <P>(a) Was it reasonable for the original court of inquiry in 1953 on the evidence before it to conclude as a matter of probability that fuel mismanagement had been the cause of the crash?</P>
      <P>(b) Is there any evidence now available that was not available to the court of inquiry which might have led it to reach a different conclusion?</P>
      <P>It is expected that the review will be completed within three months. Officials from the Department and the Attorney General's office met last Friday with the daughters of the late Captain Hanley, Nuala Hanley-Pearse, Patricia Hanley and Aoife Hanley, and their legal advisers.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for taking this initiative and establishing a further inquiry to investigate the full facts. We all must admire the tenacity of Captain T. J. Hanley's two daughters who, through thick and thin, dogmatically asserted that their father's side of the story was not fully comprehended by the original inquiry and that a grave injustice was done by virtue of his reputation being ruined. He was barred from flying for the rest of his life and spent 20 years in exile in Honolulu as a flight dispatcher. Unfortunately, he died before it was agreed that this further investigation, which will I hope clear his name, would be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, is it proposed to call many of the key witnesses not called to the original inquiry, for example, the landowner, who, strangely, was not called to give evidence or even to make a statement and others who testified to newspapers, not in court or at the inquiry, that they saw a considerable amount of fuel spewing from the starboard side of the aircraft? Will everybody who <Col N="85" /> knows anything about this accident be called? Will the inquiry be that comprehensive?</P>

      <P>It was agreed at the meeting with the Hanley sisters that senior counsel would examine the format, timescale and the contents before those matters were finalised. There was broad agreement between the officials of the Department and the Attorney General's office and the Hanley sisters on two main questions, which I outlined. I admire the tenacity of the Hanley sisters who have written to Ministers of all persuasions regarding this inquiry and the Tuskar Rock investigation. We do not know if injustices were committed, but we will never receive the correct answers because as time passes it is difficult to reconstruct events which one is examining them in present conditions as distinct from the conditions that prevailed at the time, which often alters their perception. I admire the tenacity of the sisters because they have suffered a great deal through their appreciation of what happened to their late father.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the hope for a considerable time that a flying training facility for commercial pilots would be established in Ireland given our reliance on commercial aviation. My Department, together with the Department of Defence and the Irish Aviation Authority, investigated the possibility of encouraging private sector interests to establish a school for training commercial pilots at Gormanston.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> In 1999, a media advertisement invited proposals from parties interested in promoting and operating a flying training centre at Gormanston military aerodrome on a commercial basis. A number of expressions of interest were received from the private sector and these were examined. The general conclusion was that there would be considerable financial risk attached to the operation of a training centre for commercial pilots as a stand-alone activity without support from a wider range of flying activities.</P>
    <P>My Department was recently in contact with the parties which had expressed interest in response to the 1999 advertisement and it is clear that nothing has happened in the intervening period to alter the earlier conclusion. The underlying economic circumstances have changed very markedly with the Minister for Defence's recent announcement that the Air Corps has concluded that Gormanston aerodrome is no longer required for military flying. It will be offered for sale and the proceeds will make a major contribution towards financing the Defence Forces investment programme.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I would be pleased to see private interests bidding for the Gormanston facilities with a view to continuing flying activities there. My understanding, however, is that as the Gormanston land is likely to be worth considerably more for non-aviation purposes, this may not be a realistic prospect. Clearly, the situation now needs to be reassessed very carefully in the light of the sale of Gormanston and I will be consulting further with the Minister for Defence on the matter.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State accept that it is short sighted to put this property on the market? The site will fetch a lot of money by virtue of its location and potential. However, does the Minister of State accept that this is a national asset? There are 270 acres of prime land on which there is an aerodrome with a runway and, albeit, modest terminal buildings, the site is served by the N1 and has an adjacent railway line. Surely the obvious course of action is to develop the site as a commercial airport and, at the same time, use it as a flying training facility. That was the Minister of State's original intention. We could combine its functions by way of providing a service, the decongestion of Dublin Airport and the long-term market potential of the location. This is an obvious location for an airport which could develop from a regional airport into a substantial international airport.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question would be more productively put to the Minister for Defence. However, on a personal basis, I find it difficult to disagree with the Deputy's sentiments. I have long aspired to seeing this country and the Government proceeding with a flying training <Col N="87" /> school. In July 1999, in conjunction with the Minister for Defence, we placed a notice in the national newspapers exhorting the private sector to become involved. However, things have changed dramatically and we will discuss this issue further with the Department of Defence. I would not like to see the door closed on the prospect of providing such a facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the door will be closed if the site is sold and that there would be no possibility of future development? This issue was examined when I was Minister of State at the Department and we were conscious at that time of the use of Backweston aerodrome which is now full of light and small commercial aircraft. Has the Minister of State considered the need to change legislation if this site is to be sold? We held a long debate about giving the Irish Aviation Authority control over Baldonnel aerodrome.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should not sell the site, at least not yet. However, if the site is for sale, will the Government seek to have the land rezoned for housing before it is sold? This happened with regard to the sale of the barracks in Naas. Will the same procedure be followed in this case so that we will have 270 acres of new housing land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct regarding legislation. Two years ago when we were seriously addressing this matter, as we thought, we envisaged a change in the legislation to accommodate that to which we then aspired. There has been a sea-change in the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence and we will raise this issue again with him to endeavour to re-evaluate the situation.</P>

      <P>The radon remediation grant scheme, approved by the Government in September 2000, is due to commence in the second half of this year and wind up in 2010. A financial allocation has been included in my Department's Vote in respect of the scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>A steering committee, comprising my Department, the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, is currently drawing up the terms and conditions and administrative arrangements for the scheme which will be finalised shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> The purpose of the scheme is to assist householders who have high levels of radon in their houses to undertake the necessary radon remediation works. The scheme will be administered by the RPII and will apply to private and local authority houses and to houses provided by voluntary housing organisations. Grant assistance will represent 50% of the total cost of the remediation work, subject to a maximum grant of £800 per household. I am hopeful that the scheme will encourage householders with high radon concentration levels in their homes to undertake the appropriate remediation works.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State accept that we can be forgiven for being sceptical regarding the intention to introduce this grant scheme? It is almost two years since a newspaper article entitled Grants Considered for Radon Gas Protection was published on 27 July 1999. This is 10 May 2001 and we are still being promised grants.</P>
      <P>What was the delay in introducing these grants? It has been established that any house with over 200 cubic becquerels of radon is a danger to the health of the occupants. Is the Minister of State not aware that 150 people die each year from lung cancer caused by radon gas? Is he not aware that a model for such a scheme exists in other countries which is guaranteed in terms of ensuring the welfare, safety and health of occupants? Can we have a definite date for the introduction of these grants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for the Deputy to be sceptical any longer as the scheme is going ahead. The money is in place for the first time ever. I acknowledged previously in the House that we built on the good work of the last Government, particularly Deputy Stagg's work in formulating this scheme. However, Deputy Stagg presumably experienced the same difficulty as others in convincing the Department of Finance that money should be provided. The Department has now been convinced of this need.</P>
      <P>I have long stated that I was determined to introduce this scheme. I am grateful to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, for her support in putting the scheme in place. We are gratified that the scheme is <i>in situ</i> and that it will proceed along with other measures regarding radon. In addition to this scheme, in the second half of the year we plan to run an important and necessary public awareness exercise so people will be aware of the possible deleterious effects of radon and so that more people will avail of this excellent scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be put on the record that the Minister of State said he would obtain funding for this scheme and he has done so by hook or by crook. The RPII has identified the high risk areas which should be targeted first in the promotion of the grant scheme. A scheme should be <Col N="89" /> immediately put in place for testing individual houses. The RPII carries out such work but this should be promoted now so individual houses can be tested so that if they are above the limit, they can apply for the grant when introduced.</P>

It has also placed an order for a further 20 additional diesel rail cars for delivery in 2003. Iarnród Éireann will have a total of 144 diesel rail cars in operation by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has a variety of further rolling stock which is used on mainline and suburban services. Some 44 carriages used on suburban services date from the 1960s. I understand that Iarnród Éireann plans to take these carriages out of service on the introduction of the new diesel rail cars. Some 71 carriages used on mainline and suburban services date from the 1970s. Of the remaining carriages used by Iarnród Éireann, 151 date from the 1980s and the 14 carriages used on the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service date from the introduction of the service in 1997. The national development plan provides for 20 new mainline rail carriages and I understand that Iarnród Éireann has commenced the tendering process with regard to them.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has advised me that it operates five types of locomotive. They were purchased in 1961, 1963, 1966, 1973 and 1994, respectively. The purchase of rolling stock is part of the £1 billion investment under the national development plan.</P>

There is a need for a more efficient, speedier and reliable rail service than at present. The old locomotives are clapped out and should be scrapped.

      <P>The question was multi-faceted and my reply was not only about locomotives. I understand they were purchased between 1961 and 1994 and there are no further locomotives on order at present. I do not know if that is correct but I will check it and contact the Deputy. As I have said on many occasions, there was a criminal neglect of the track network throughout the country. A total of £500 million has been spent on it and a rail safety audit will be carried out in two weeks. This will be the second or third audit of work done on the track. There was also criminal neglect in relation to carriages and CIE as a whole. However, £1 billion will be spent in this area.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's point. I travelled to Sligo recently on a Sunday and I returned on the train that left at 6 p.m. While the journey was safe, there were many things I would have changed in relation to the infrastructure. However, work on the track to Sligo is almost complete. This work was most important because the track must be safe. The needs of CIE were neglected by all parties. Fortunately, resources are being provided now but, unfortunately, change takes time and is difficult. However, I share the Deputy's concerns and I will contact him about the locomotives.</P>

    <P>Mr. Higgins<i> (Mayo)</i><b>:</b> From replies to questions I had put to the Minister and to the Taoiseach on the Order of Business I formed the impression the flotation was not only stalled but abandoned. It is now clear it is back on track. In view of this will the Minister indicate the time frame involved? Given the advice she has received from the long list of consultants what price consideration is involved? What consultation is ongoing with the trade union movement on the privatisation? Given that the Bill has been passed by the Seanad, when will it be introduced to this House so that Second Stage may be debated and parties may state their positions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Taoiseach nor I said the issue was dead. Deputy Stagg will be aware of that. We have repeatedly said the Government has taken a decision but the industrial relations difficulties at the airline would have to be resolved before we proceed. The Government and I are very keen to proceed. We are strongly of the view that Aer Lingus would greatly benefit by taking a strategic route and by becoming involved in an IPO or some other method of sale. The precise timing will be influenced by the conclusion of discussions with Aer Lingus employees, which had commenced and were progressing well before the industrial relations difficulties abounded. The discussions were then put to one side but when we are informed by the company that these difficulties have steadied we will proceed with our plans.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been passed by the Seanad. We will also consider market conditions as it would only be possible to sell if these were favourable. These factors, plus the IPO and the future of Aer Lingus are of concern to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister continues to say she wants to flog Aer Lingus. Does she not agree that it would be madness to proceed with this Thatcherite decision to sell a strategic asset and lose control over the use of it? The refusal by Eircom to carry out Government policy on the issue of broadband, which we discussed earlier, is an example of what may arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined a number of outstanding factors requiring resolution before proceeding with the Government's decision. Will she include again, as she did before, the outstanding issue of the pensions paid to other retired aviation staff? She gave a commitment to the House that this matter would be addressed before proceeding with privatisation. Is the Minister whistling past the graveyard on this issue, pretending that something will happen and creating uncertainty for the airline that makes it impossible for it to develop in the interim period?</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister not accept that to try to sell Aer Lingus at present, apart from the national strategic considerations, will be extremely difficult? There are 6,000 staff so there will be a lot of grief if it is privatised. Aer Lingus requires 6,000 staff to fly six million passengers each year while Ryanair, for which I hold no brief, flies seven million passengers each year with 1,400 staff. There is much grief ahead.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that much damage has been done to the credibility of State flotations by the Eircom debacle? Third, does she not accept that, from the point of view of a saleable commodity, an airline is extremely difficult to sell to investors? This is the most volatile&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by Aer Rianta that, in conjunction with representatives of the aviation industry at Dublin Airport, it recently developed a comprehensive noise management strategy for Dublin Airport. The strategy incorporates a policy statement, a set of general objectives and an action plan. This action plan is being implemented by the Dublin Airport operations planning group which is fully representative of all the aviation interests at Dublin Airport including Aer Rianta, the Irish Aviation Authority and airlines. The noise management strategy is part of the broader process of consultation by Aer Rianta. It is envisaged that this consultation will, in due course, also involve local residents.</P>
      <P>As part of this strategy, Aer Rianta is in the process of procuring and installing a noise and flight track monitoring system. This will be an integrated system whereby aircraft flight tracks and aircraft noise will be monitored at six fixed reference points around Dublin Airport. The locations for these reference points have been selected in accordance with the criteria set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The system will be implemented on a par with best practice at other airports in Europe and will comply with all relevant standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" />
      <i>Additional information</i>No legislation will be required from my Department to allow for the implementation of this system. However, planning permission is required from Fingal County Council and an application will be lodged shortly by Aer Rianta. The Irish Aviation Authority will support the aircraft tracks and noise monitoring system by making available radar data. The authority has also assisted in alleviating the impact of aircraft noise by the introduction of departures procedures at Dublin Airport which minimize the impact of aircraft on major residential areas.</P>
    <P>The regulations which apply in Ireland to aircraft noise levels are those which have been promulgated at European Union level. As a result of these regulations, the older and nosier generation of aircraft will be banned from European Union airports from 1 April 2002.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce night time curfews at Dublin Airport. While I am alive to the concerns of residents, I must also bear in mind the needs of other sectors, such as manufacturing industry, international cargo operators, charter operators and their passengers. These sectors rely very heavily on open access at Dublin Airport, particularly in view of modern &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; distribution methods which are essential to the functioning of modern international companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been contacted by parents and staff of Our Lady of Mercy primary school in Sligo regarding the proposed suppression of one teaching post with effect from 31 August 2001. The school is situated in an area of huge economic and social disadvantage, the worst in the north-west. Over 70% of the catchment area of the school is in this disadvantaged region. It is one of the main disadvantaged regions in the north-west and it is preposterous that the Department of Education and Science is proposing to remove a teacher under the urban cycle for disadvantage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the largest primary school in Sligo town. The Minister saw at first hand last February the excellent work being done by all the partners in the school community. Removal of this post will <Col N="100" /> cause problems which the school thought it had sorted out previously. The school authority simply cannot implement the Department's maximum class size guidelines if this decision proceeds. At junior level it would mean class sizes of 24 to 26 when the minimum is 20, while at senior level it would mean class sizes of 31 to 35 when the maximum is 29.</P>
    <P>Our Lady of Mercy school has a strong policy of integration as laid down in the Department's guidelines. Given the school's open door policy and its strong ethos of concern for the poor and socially disadvantaged, the loss of a post in the next school year would seriously compromise the school in that area. The school has not even had the benefit of the second post during this school year. The post had to be advertised and the second successful applicant had to work three months' notice. This person is not due to start in the school until 28 May, almost at the end of the school year. The school spent over £400 advertising for a temporary teacher and got no reply. Natural justice and a sense of fair play should be applied to the school. There are over 540 students and 31 teachers and they demand that this post not be suppressed.</P>
    <P>I will quote from a letter forwarded to the Department of Education and Science by the home/school liaison co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>As the H.S.C.L. co-ordinator in this school I simply cannot accept what you set out in recent correspondence to Chairperson, Board of Management.</P>
    <P>I know only too well from first hand experience on the ground how much we need to keep this second post.</P>
    <P>The maximum class guidelines will not be adhered to and already hard pressed teachers will be unable to cope with the extra numbers. All the good work of recent years will be undone by this poorly thought out decision.</P>
    <P>I urge in the strongest of terms that the decision be reversed and that we be allowed to keep this second post for another school year even in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not willing to give priority to disadvantaged status in urban areas, the Government is losing its way in education policy. I urge the Minister of State to, at least, allow the second post to be left in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to clarify to the House the staffing position of Our Lady of Mercy primary school. The Minister for Education and Science regrets that he cannot be present to answer the matter. I will also outline to the House how the school is benefiting from the new disadvantage programme for pri<Col N="101" /> mary schools which the Minister announced in January.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a specific year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule formulated for a specific year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO. The staffing of the school in question is a principal and 19 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 564 pupils at 30 September 1999. The school has also been allocated a disadvantaged concessionary teaching post.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new programme to tackle educational disadvantage, Giving Children An Even Break, launched by the Minister for Education and Science in January this year. All primary schools were invited to participate in a comprehensive survey conducted by the Educational Research Centre in April and May of 2000 on behalf of the Department of Education and Science. The purpose of the survey was to identify objectively the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to areas of greatest need. The findings were used to allocate resources under the new programme to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. The programme involves expenditure of £26 million over a three year period, including the immediate allocation of more than 200 new teacher posts and supplementary funding to primary schools with concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension. Under the urban dimension, the Minister is committed to supporting schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes over the three year period of 20:1 in junior classes, which comprise infants through second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, which comprise third through sixth class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural areas, selected schools will have the services of a teacher/co-ordinator which will work in clusters of four or five schools. Prioritised schools which could not be clustered with other similar schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to teacher/co-ordinator support. In addition, all participating schools will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils concerned. Based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the school as reflected in its return to the Educational Research Centre, Our Lady of Mercy primary school was one of a number of selected schools <Col N="102" /> considered for additional teaching staff under the urban dimension.</P>
    <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the new programme in respect of the current school year are also determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 1999. To enable Our Lady of Mercy primary school to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes under the new programme, the school has benefited from the appointment of two additional teaching posts in the current school year.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of Our Lady of Mercy primary school at 30 September 2000 determines the staffing for the 2001-02 school year. Under the terms of the staffing schedule, this enrolment warrants the retention of the staffing of a principal and 19 mainstream class teachers in addition to the disadvantaged concessionary teaching post. The enrolment at the school at 30 September 2000 was 543 pupils compared with 564 pupils at 30 September 1999. Examination of the pupil numbers in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2000 shows a significant reduction compared to the 30 September 1999 enrolment. One additional teaching post is warranted under the new programme to implement the maximum class size guidelines. On this basis, one of the two teaching posts allocated to Our Lady of Mercy primary school in respect of the current school year will be withdrawn with effect from 31 August 2001.</P>
    <P>Our Lady of Mercy primary school is included in the urban dimension of the new programme and also eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £5,171 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned in respect of the current school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter. I hope the Minister of State will deal with the issues as quickly as possible. I understand from the national farming media that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has asked the expert group whether it will allow the sale of cattle from farm to farm. As I also understand the Minister has been involved in a press conference in the past hour or so, perhaps the Minister of State will have more information and advise the House what has happened in the past hour. It is important that, while using all advice available, the Minister makes the decision himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Monaghan County Council unanimously passed a resolution calling on the Minister and the expert group on foot and mouth disease to immediately allow for the sale of livestock and, if possible, to consider the reopening of all cattle marts to allow farmers sell cattle which, in many <Col N="103" /> cases, cause serious overstocking and financial problems. This original proposal was made by councillors Pádraig McNally and Patsy Treanor, both members of the main Government party. The extent of the crisis can be appreciated when these councillors felt it necessary to bring this resolution before the county council for discussion.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister has agreed a protocol allowing the importation of horses from the United Kingdom with effect from 4 May. How many people were told about this on or before 4 May? When did it become available through the Department's press office and when did the expert group sanction it? I understand it is not yet on the Department's website. I only received word of it at 4.30 p.m. when I was handed a press release stating that the Minister had agreed a protocol with effect from 4 May. This means people had not been informed by 4.30 p.m. today.</P>
    <P>Another crisis has occurred for farmers who wish to move cattle in that staff in the district veterinary offices refuse to handle movement permits for closed herds and pure bred bulls, sheep and pigs. This relates to forms FMD 5 and 7. The dispute has occurred because of a breakdown of communications between the Minister, his Department and staff in district veterinary offices. The staff, especially those in the Border area, have worked all hours, and a little courtesy would have avoided this problem. Instead, a crisis has been caused for many hard-pressed farmers.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the farmers affected are those who were bought out because of BSE. They cannot obtain permits to restock, although they have been allowed publicly to buy cattle. Stock bulls needed for suckler herds and others cannot be bought, although the Minister has allowed them to be bought. Farmers with herds closed because of TB or brucellosis are not allowed to move cattle to out-farms or leased or rented land.</P>
    <P>I had a phone call on Tuesday from a dairy farmer who had sold cattle to a BSE herd owner. He was a few hours too late in having his herd tests returned, the clampdown had happened. Another farmer, who has 105 cattle on his farm instead of the normal 65 as a result of TB, has rented land and is now grazing his silage land because he is not allowed to get permits.</P>
    <P>We have a major crisis. Fine Gael has given the Government all the support it possibly could. The time has come to have this staff crisis &ndash; which should be fairly minor matter &ndash; sorted out. It will allow sales to begin as quickly as possible and avoid further damage to the national herd.</P>
    <P>We are now in mid-May. That there are extra cattle on farms is causing a serious crisis not just in respect of this year's winter feedstuff but next year's too. It is also causing financial problems. I do not have the figures to hand but the early <Col N="104" /> indications suggest a very disappointing level of help given to hard pressed families in the form of social welfare payments. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development agreed in this House to assistance but it does not seem to have reached the people who provide the service at grass roots level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I begin by providing some background in relation to foot and mouth disease in this State. The news to date is positive. There has been no case of the disease in the South since the first and only case was confirmed on 22 March. My Department's tracing exercise is continuing, albeit that the number of holdings currently under restriction on a precautionary basis has been reduced to about 60. A sample from a single calf in County Tipperary is at present in Pirbright for analysis, but the veterinary advice that I have is that there is no need to be overly concerned about this particular case.</P>
      <P>In addition, results received from Pirbright this morning indicate that samples from sheep found in north Leitrim are negative for foot and mouth disease. The outlook for Ireland is positive, and the manner in which restrictions have been lifted in a phased and controlled way in recent times is a reflection of that.</P>
      <P>However, Deputies need hardly be reminded that the situation in the United Kingdom remains a serious risk overhang for this country. New cases are still being confirmed each day in Britain. In addition the news from the North of Ireland yesterday about new suspect cases in counties Derry and Antrim is a timely reminder that the virus may still be circulating on this island.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the pressures on farmers and I am appreciative of the efforts they have made since 21 February to keep the disease at bay. I am also conscious of the fact that if we relax controls in an indiscriminate manner and if it results in a new foot and mouth disease outbreak in the State, this will result in the renewal of all of the restrictions which have been lifted in recent days.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I recognise the need to balance the continued need for caution with the real needs of farmers on the ground. In this context the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development announced this evening that the expert group had considered the question of farm to farm movements earlier today, that they had made a number of recommendations in this regard and that he had accepted those recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, farm to farm movements of bovine animals will be allowed, subject to permit, from Monday next, 14 May 2001. The expert group has not recommended lifting the restrictions on sheep <Col N="105" /> movements and it is not anticipated that any progress will be made on this issue for some time yet.</P>
    <P>The permitting arrangements will involve an extension of the current farm movement notification system and will include arrangements for the notification of herd numbers, tag numbers, residency requirements and other aspects of the animals to be moved. Permits will be valid for seven days and application forms will be obtainable from district veterinary offices, Teagasc offices and SWS in Bandon. The new arrangements will subsume the pre-existing permitting arrangements for stock bulls, for movements from feedlots and for movements between fragments of the same holding. Veterinary examination immediately prior to movement will no longer be required.</P>
    <P>This is the most significant single adjustment to date in the controls in place and I am confident that it will relieve the pressure now building up on farms throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the question of the refusal by members of the Civil and Public Services Union, CPSU, in district veterinary offices to deal with queries relating to permits for movement to between fragments of the same holding &ndash; foot and mouth disease five &ndash; and for movement of stock bulls &ndash; foot and mouth disease seven &ndash;  both of which are issued by Teagasc offices. While this may well result in additional difficulty for those wishing to obtain information about the permitting arrangements, it is still possible to obtain such permits from Teagasc offices. In addition, as I have already indicated, this entire system is being subsumed into the new permitting arrangement for inter farm movement which will operate from next Monday.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I deeply regret that the CPSU, whose members have performed such trojan work in helping us get through this crisis, have found it necessary to take this action. I believe that the stance of the union may be based on certain misconceptions, which I feel can be dispelled. I am anxious to do this without delay and a meeting has been arranged with the union involved to try to resolve the issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do everything in a balanced way. <i>Festina lente</i>, hasten slowly, is the best policy. We would regret if an over-relaxation of controls led to another outbreak in this country.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit teacht isteach chun an cheist seo a fhreagairt.</P>
      <P>The decision by the Government to increase the pay for some child care workers is a very welcome and long overdue development. I understand the increases to range between 19% and 27%, and up to 44.8%, for those who were most badly paid in the past. It is the largest percentage increase yet negotiated under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This should help attract new people into the area of child care. It will go some way in redressing what has been a very poor rate of pay. According to the <i>Irish Journal of Applied Social Studies,</i> residential child care workers may work up to 64 hours in a week and be paid only £2 per hour for 16 of those hours. Many of us, especially those familiar with places such as Oberstown, Trinity House and the many health board premises in Dublin, are well aware of the difficult and stressful conditions that many of the child care workers have to operate in. Better all-round employment conditions will hopefully help to recruit and retain residential child care staff.</P>
      <P>Last March, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly &ndash; who has played a tremendous role in highlighting the child care crisis in our health services &ndash; said he was profoundly disturbed to discover 50 children had been placed in accommodation run by a private security company because of the lack of health board personnel. A particular concern has been raised about how all encompassing these new changes will be. Will the new changes be extended to residential child care staff working with those with intellectual disabilities? I understand a letter from the IMPACT trade union was sent to the Minister for Health and Children early in April, seeking clarification on this point among others, and a response has not been received other than a standard acknowledgment.</P>
      <P>Heretofore there were similar grades in these two main areas with the same qualifications and particulars of office. The new arrangements will abolish the house parent and assistant house parent grades, replacing them with two new grades of child care worker and child care leader. It would appear to be completely untenable to have two different regimes in the two services with different rates of pay. The result of this would be to drain workers away from the area of dealing with those with intellectual disabilities to the higher paying sections of residential child care. This would effectively be robbing Peter to care for Paul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister state precisely what the new arrangements will be for the workers in the entire residential child care area and clarify whether there will be a similar regime for all workers, or a divided system with one set of grades and pay <Col N="107" /> for some child care workers and another set for those who work with the intellectually disabled? In considering these concerns of care workers I ask that a practice of paying increments to child care workers promptly be established. A tendency to delay payments of increments has developed. For example, an increase in the sleep-over allowance was granted more than a year ago but some child care workers are still waiting those increments. Others have been overpaid and are now obliged to repay their health board this difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also carry out an assessment of the resources available to the salary sections of each health board. If extra staff are needed for payment offices let them be appointed so that when this inconsistency in relation to different rates of pay is resolved all staff will be paid a proper and equitable wage, and paid promptly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this issue and I am glad of the opportunity to clarify the situation for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I wish to give the Deputy the background to the situation which led to the recent pay increase for child care workers. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997 an expert group was established to deal with a range of issues affecting a number of health and social care professions.</P>
      <P>The expert group published a report in April 2000 which recommended that a joint committee representing employers and trade unions be established to deal with child care workers. The following are the recommended terms of reference for that committee: the setting up of a proper career structure for both the residential and community child care workers; the changes required in general management of child and family services and in case management arising as a consequence; the management of changes arising from the ending of recruitment of unqualified child care workers; a complete review of the training available to child care workers, with a view to the introduction of a nationally recognised professional qualification and the provision of regular in-service training; the arrangements for training of unqualified staff to an acceptable standard. The committee has begun its work on the implementation of these recommendations which will do much to improve the attractiveness of a career in child care services.</P>
      <P>Employers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting and retaining workers in the child care area. Low pay in the area has been stated by many to be contributing to these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of unqualified staff working in the child care area has been highlighted in many arenas and acknowledged by all to be unsatisfactory. Those dealing with the most vulnerable <Col N="108" /> must be trained to a recognised professional standard.</P>
    <P>All of these issues are being addressed by this joint committee. The first step in resolving the difficulties was the establishment of a new career structure for those working within child care. This new structure has resulted in the ceasing of the recruitment of unqualified staff, with the exception of those at trainee level. Arrangements will also be put in place to facilitate all those working without a formal qualification to up-skill themselves. Coupled with these developments was the introduction of a revised pay scale for those working in the child care area.</P>
    <P>I am confident these developments are the first of a series that will deal with the difficulties being experienced by those employed in the child care area.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the trade union IMPACT that it wishes to have the revised pay arrangements paid to house parents and assistant house parents working with other care groups.

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's headline in <i>The Irish Times </i>says &ldquo;Government fails to act over virulent racism&rdquo;. The Government and particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stands condemned for its failure to launch a long promised anti-racism public awareness campaign.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that in February 2000 the Government announced its intention to undertake a public awareness programme to address racism in Ireland. It asked the national consultative commission on racism and inter-culturalism to undertake an evaluation plan of how to implement such a public awareness campaign. That was completed almost a year ago, following extensive consultation.</P>
      <P>Why has this issue gone off the Government's agenda while racially motivated attacks continue, particularly in the Dublin area but also throughout the country? What is happening? When will this public awareness campaign be launched? It is May and the programme has not been launched although the Government promised to launch it more than 15 months ago. What has been happening and what is the reason for the delay? When I raised this matter last October the House was told that £4.5 million had been set aside for this campaign which was to begin before Christmas. Why has nothing happened since then?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> Amnesty International said today that many NGOs are openly questioning the Government commitment to tackling racism because of the delay in implementing this important programme. Government leadership and a strong campaign are critical elements in tackling this issue.</P>
    <P>Such a campaign was never more needed, given the rising number of racist incidents on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere. There are disturbing reports in today's papers of racially motivated attacks, racial insults to adults and children and racist graffiti. Racism is an attack on human rights and a campaign is crucial to deal with that.</P>
    <P>A public awareness campaign on its own is not enough. We need strong law behind it. Equally important is the need to review the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act because we have seen that this is ineffective. Lawyers have said the burden of proof needed under this Act is so high that prosecutions are not likely to be taken under it.</P>
    <P>We do not officially record the number of racist incidents and we should. We have a legal obligation to do this under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to look at this aspect of crime reporting to see whether action should be taken so that the scale of the problem can be properly understood, recorded and monitored and effective action taken.</P>
    <P>I call for immediate action and strong leadership by the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to tackle this problem. We have strong equal status legislation. This is a help but more is needed. Launching an effective public awareness programme, reviewing the incitement to hatred legislation and resourcing community groups working on racism will send out a strong signal at home, and to the international community, that Ireland is prepared to tackle racism and promote a more inclusive and multi-cultural society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for having raised this issue on the Adjournment. Last October the Government agreed to a proposal from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to implement a national anti-racism public awareness programme with the overall aim of contributing to creating the conditions for building a more inclusive and intercultural society where racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued. The Government allocated a core budget of £1.5 million per annum to the programme over a three year period beginning on 1 January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February, the Minister announced the establishment of a high level steering group to implement the programme in partnership with the equality division of his Department. The equality division will have overall responsibility <Col N="110" /> for co-ordinating the programme and its budget. The steering group has an independent chairperson and 19 members. Its membership is broad based and includes representatives of ethnic minority communities, the four social partners, national bodies such as the Equality Authority, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, and relevant Departments. The group is chaired by Mr. Joe McDonagh of Galway, a former president of the GAA. The secretariat for the group is provided by the equality division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of the awareness programme are to act as a catalyst to stimulate public awareness of racism and to contribute to a commitment to addressing racism in Ireland; to affirm cultural diversity as a value in our society and to encourage practical ways of taking it into account; to help create the conditions that make it more difficult for racism to exist and to contribute to a range of policies that promote an inclusive approach to minority ethnic groups including refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>The awareness programme will be based on an outline framework that was developed by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. Initiatives will be taken in the areas of community and local development, media and communications, the role of statutory authorities and public education, and will aim to produce long-term sustainable outcomes.</P>
    <P>The steering group had its first meeting on 2 April. I should mention that an earlier meeting had to be cancelled due to the foot and mouth disease crisis. At its first meeting, the steering group discussed and agreed its terms of reference and procedural issues. It also reached consensus on the aim and objectives of the awareness programme.</P>
    <P>The first task the steering group undertook was to arrange for a baseline survey of attitudes and opinions on minority ethnic groups, racism and interculturalism among the general public and key audiences. The survey, which will be nationwide, will be a crucial cornerstone of the programme. The results of the survey will help to determine the focus and direction of the campaign and will serve as a benchmark for the programme. Further surveys will be arranged during and at the end of the programme to assist in monitoring changes in attitudes and opinions.</P>
    <P>The steering group is aware of the need to support community based initiatives. It intends to involve community groups, area based partnerships and organisations of minority ethnic groups in the awareness programme. With this in mind, plans are under way to launch a small grants fund to support and facilitate such groups and organisations. This is an aspect of the programme that the group can proceed with in the short-term in advance of a formal launch of the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Preparations are in train for a formal launch of the programme. The launch and media campaign, if they are to be a success, must be well planned and properly co-ordinated. The NCCRI report, which is being used as an outline framework for the programme, recommended a three month pre-launch phase.</P>
    <P>There are a number of procedures to be followed in planning a launch in conjunction with an advertising campaign. Rules regarding tendering have to be followed. This may include the placing of an advertisement in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> and the need to allow for the official response period of 56 days.</P>
    <P>There are also key tasks to be carried out as part of the planning and development of the launch, including conducting a survey of attitudes <Col N="112" /> and opinions, and analysing its results; developing links with key organisations working in the area of racism; integrating existing initiatives into the programme; developing a distinct identity and image for the programme; the preparation of media and information packs and seeking the support of key media organisations.</P>
    <P>Part of the task of the steering group will be to monitor all elements of the programme and to measure its impact and success. The group will provide an annual progress report to Government and will also publish an annual report. We all appreciate the need for an anti-racism awareness programme. However, the temptation to rush into short-term actions has to be resisted.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 May 2001.</P>

      <P>My main concern in relation to whatever strategy is decided on for Aer Rianta is that it is the correct strategy, not just for the company itself and its employees but also for the users of the State airports. The advice of my advisers Warburg Dillon Read in this matter, having considered all the options, was that an IPO was the preferred route. They stated that, on balance, the IPO option best provides commercial flexibility and necessary access to new funds to ward off financial pressures and develop the company.</P>
      <P>I concur with the view that private sector participation in Aer Rianta would be in the best interests of the company, in terms of addressing its funding needs in the long-term. I am, however, conscious that private sector involvement in Aer Rianta, whether through a minority IPO or otherwise, raises policy aspects which I and other Ministers need to reflect carefully upon.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the report by a consultancy group (details supplied) in relation to strategies to control crowding on commuter trains at peak times; if she will bring recommendations to Government arising from the report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The control of crowding on trains is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann. The report referred to by the Deputy, produced by Halcrow Group Limited, was commissioned by Iarnród Éireann to review its strategy for controlling crowds on commuter trains in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The consultants identified various options open to Iarnród Éireann to control crowding and divided their findings into three categories, that is, &ldquo;recommended to continue&rdquo;, &ldquo;recommended for further detailed evaluation by Iarnród Éireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;not recommended&rdquo;. I understand that Iarnród Éireann is considering these options at present. However, I note that one of the options which the consultants have recommended for further evaluation by Iarnród Éireann, relates to the use of ticket pricing to control demand. I am opposed to such an option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> It is the policy of this Government to encourage maximum use of public transport, including the railways. To this end, the Government has financed the purchase of new rolling stock by Iarnród Éireann to increase the passenger carrying capacity of the railway. On the DART line, ten new rail cars entered service in November last and a further 16 rail cars are going into service at present. A further 12 DART rail cars are due for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2001 and should enter service early in 2002.</P>
    <P>Twenty diesel rail cars were purchased for use on the Maynooth line and are ready for use, pending resolution of the industrial dispute. A further 58 diesel rail cars have been ordered for delivery in 2002 and 2003. These 58 rail cars are suitable for use on longer distance routes and outer suburban routes in the Dublin area. Finally, I understand that CIE have ordered a further 22 rail cars for delivery in 2002 and 2003. This on-going delivery of new rail cars will increase the capacity available to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties.</P>

      <P>Last year, I authorised An Post to examine options regarding a possible strategic alliance with one of the major European operators. The necessity to do this arises from competitive pressures, both from the liberalisation of the market and the consolidation which is taking place in the European postal industry, driven by the four main players, the post offices of Germany, Holland, Britain and France. While I am kept informed of developments, the investigation by An Post into the alliance possibilities is an ongoing process. I understand that there are indications of interest but it is too early yet to judge the eventual outcome. I expect An Post to report to me on this matter later this year.</P>
      <P>Last week, I published the Postal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2001, which provides a legal framework to allow An Post to enter into an equity based alliance with another postal company.</P>

      <P>We do not make payments directly to Euratom. Ireland is party to the EU treaties, and we are obliged to meet our commitments under these treaties. These include payment of our contribution to the EU budget. Euratom activities form part of this budget and the expenses of Euratom are financed directly out of the general EU budget.</P>
      <P>The Euratom Treaty remains the main framework for dealing with nuclear matters within the European Union. Because of our particular stance on nuclear issues, and given that we are part of the main committees under the Euratom structure, our objectives and priorities have been to influence the direction of these committees. Ireland's priority has been to steer the Euratom programme of activities towards a high emphasis on nuclear safety and radiological protection, rather than towards the expansion of the nuclear energy sector.</P>
      <P>We will continue to argue our case and seek to influence others at every available opportunity under the Euratom structure. In short, the Euratom structure can be used by Ireland to emphasise the nuclear safety imperative and to seek to influence a shift away from efforts towards support or expansion of the nuclear energy sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 73 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>I have said on many occasions that questions about the future ownership of commercial State companies fall to be determined on a case by case basis, in the context of developments in their main business areas. The following is the position in relation to the commercial State companies, under my aegis.</P>
      <P>I have already answered separate questions on the privatisation of Aer Lingus today and I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 11, 36, 37, 39 and 65 in the matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the CIE group of companies, the consultation paper entitled A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, was published by the Government in September 2000. It sets out a number of proposals on the restructuring of the CIE companies including the possible privatisation of the bus companies. These proposals are currently the subject of consultation with the public transport partnership forum which was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>No Government decision has been taken in respect of the recommendation of the board of Aer Rianta that there be an IPO of a minority shareholding in that company.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to privatize the IAA, which was incorporated as a commercial State company in 1994 and is the safety regulator and provider of air navigation services in Irish controlled airspace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Government's decision of 23 February 1999, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation initiated an extensive search process to identify business development opportunities to underpin the operation of the Whitegate refinery. Four definite proposals were submitted to the INPC, whose board recommended the submission received from the Tosco Corporation to acquire the refinery and the Whiddy Oil terminal. The proposal involves a commitment to operate the facilities in question for a minimum of 15 years. The consultants who are advising me on <Col N="118" /> the proposed deal subsequently endorsed that recommendation.</P>
    <P>As I announced on 31 July 2000, I authorised INPC to enter into a period of exclusive negotiations with the Tosco Corporation for the sale of the refinery, the oil terminal and the INPC business. The National Oil Reserves Agency is not included in the terms of the sales. This announcement followed an extensive search for potential partners, submission of expressions of interest and receipt of firm proposals, which were rigorously reviewed before shortlisting and final selection. INPC and Tosco have had detailed negotiations since then. I have just received a recommendation from the INPC board in favour of concluding a transaction, which I am considering. My Department and the Department of Finance, with the aid of legal and economic consultants, have been directly involved in the negotiations in respect of shareholder issues. Assuming that I decide to put this matter forward for Government approval, the transaction could not be completed without primary legislation, which in turn will influence the timeframe. There are other issues also to be resolved, not least in relation to the employees.</P>
    <P>There are currently no plans with regard to the flotation-privatisation of the ESB. I wrote to the chairman of the ESB and invited the board to let me have its views on the future direction of the ESB, including such issues as alliances, strategic partnerships, structure and ownership. I also encouraged the board and the ESB group of unions to discuss this matter together. The board concluded in January 2001, having taken full account of the submissions from the ESB management and unions, that the essential conditions for a successful change of ownership do not prevail at this time. Therefore, the board decided that it would be inappropriate to proceed with a change of ownership recommendation at this stage. The board also decided to urgently pursue with the ESB group of unions, in a spirit of partnership, the development of a comprehensive strategy for the future development and growth of the ESB. I welcome the efforts taken to date by the board, the management and unions in relation to this important issue. I respect the conclusion arrived at by the board. I am confident that all parties will work together in a spirit of openness and partnership to develop this partnership strategy.</P>

    <P>There is no current timetable to privatise Bord Gáis Éireann. Prudent policy dictates that we proceed on a step-by-step basis, the first step being completion of draft legislation to establish BGE as a public limited company, which is currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>Last year I authorised An Post to examine options regarding a possible strategic alliance with one of the major European operators. The necessity to do this arises from competitive pressures both from the liberalisation of the market <Col N="119" /> and the consolidation which is taking place in the European postal industry, driven by four main players, the post offices of Germany, Holland, Britain and France. While I am kept informed of developments, the investigation by An Post into the alliance possibilities is an ongoing process. I understand there are indications of interest but it is too early yet to judge the eventual outcome. I expect An Post to report to me on this matter later this year. However, privatisation is not currently envisaged or planned for An Post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently asked the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta for their comments on a revised proposal by the Retired Aviation Staff Association for enhanced pension benefits for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners. The revised proposal from RASA involves the making of additional annual payments by Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta into the pension fund, for the purpose of increasing pensioners' payments to the same level as would apply to serving staff on the basis of current pay levels.</P>
      <P>The chairmen have advised me that neither Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta are in a position to provide additional annual payments into the pension fund as would be required under the revised claim from the retirees association. I have been advised that both companies have been meeting all of their liabilities towards the pension fund in accordance with the rules of the scheme and that the scheme is delivering the benefits for which it was established. As regards pension enhancements to benefit both serving staff and existing pensioners, the companies' position is that these will emerge from negotiations with representatives of staff which are associated with strategic change initiatives in respect of both companies. In the case of Aer Lingus, this means the privatisation of the airline as decided by the Government.</P>
      <P>As I previously indicated, the terms of the proposed new pension schemes are essentially a matter for the companies concerned to negotiate with staff interests, taking account of a number of factors, not least affordability and industrial relations priorities for the companies concerned. Existing Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners who transfer to the new Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pension schemes will receive the improved benefits when the new schemes are introduced.</P>

      <P>Capital investment in mainline rail services prior to 1999 was provided from EU sources and CIE's own resources. There was no Exchequer investment. In 1999 Exchequer funding of £76 million was made available for mainline rail investment and almost £100 million in 2000. The national development plan provides for the investment of £500 million in the mainline network to upgrade the infrastructure, rolling stock and facilities over the lifetime of the plan.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann informs me that passenger journey numbers have grown on all its services since 1990. The figures are as follows: 1990 &ndash; 7,787 million; 1991 &ndash; 7,742 million; 1992 &ndash; 7,630 million; 1993 &ndash; 7,903 million; 1994 &ndash; 7,850 million; 1995 &ndash; 8,312 million; 1996 &ndash; 8,393 million; 1997 &ndash; 8,906 million; 1998 &ndash; 9,831 million; 1999 &ndash; 10,219 million; 2000 &ndash; 9,695 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>In May 1998, I set an indicative timetable for the construction and completion of the light rail lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. Based on progress to date, I am confident that the target date of 2003 for commencement of passenger services on the light rail line from Tallaght to Connolly Station will be achieved. The Light Rail Advisory and Action Group, which I established to oversee the timetable for the project, reported to me in February, 2001, and assured me that the target date of 2003 remains feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land acquisition programme is well advanced on both lines and negotiations are currently under way regarding the remaining lands to be acquired. While the completion of the acquisition process is not a prerequisite to the commencement of works, the light rail project office expects negotiations on the bulk of the <Col N="122" /> remaining lands to be finalised by the end of the year. Preparatory works on the Tallaght to Connolly Station line commenced in August 1999, and are now substantially complete in some areas. Utility diversion works on the line commenced in December 1999, and some of these contracts have also been completed.</P>
    <P>The contractor for the main construction elements of the project was selected in March 2001, and this work, involving mainly track laying and cabling for all lines, will commence on both lines during summer 2001. Work on the Red Cow depot started in August, 2000, and is on schedule for completion in July 2001. The first tram is scheduled for delivery to Dublin in October 2001, and two trams per month will be delivered after January 2002. The competition to select an operator for the system is well underway and it is expected that the franchise will be awarded in October 2001.</P>

      <P>I have received the report referred to. The objective in commissioning this report was to quantify and assess the impact of investment in co-location, complex web hosting, web farming, advanced data processing, and similar e-commerce related facilities on the energy demand and supply situation in Ireland. The report was to also to advise on the appropriate investment, regulatory and legislative measures needed to ensure that Ireland remained competitive in attracting and retaining this type of investment.</P>
      <P>My Department, Forfás and the Taoiseach's Department recruited the consultants in September 2000, following a competitive tender process to commission a report regarding the impact of energy security issues on the delivery of the information society in Ireland. This bid was the most economically advantageous and cost £54,877. It was finalised at the end of January and its recommendations studied. The report recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, a full deregulation of the CHP market. I have implemented this recommendation through section 9(f2&gt;a)(ii) of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>The report has been circulated to all the relevant Departments and the Commission for Electricity Regulation and has been published on my Department's website, www.dpe.ie.

      <P>The Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 requires the Commission for Electricity Regulation, in carrying out its duties, to have regard for the need to promote the continuity, security and supply of electricity. The Act also lays a duty on the Commission to prepare, at regular intervals, forecast statements in respect of power supply, including generating capacity, the demand for electricity and flows and loading on the transmission system.</P>

      <P>At the current stage of development of the wind industry within the European Union there is no single mechanism which provides the optimum means of supporting wind energy technologies on or off shore. At the national level, there is up to £43 million provided in the national development plan to support renewable energy technologies generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the contribution the offshore wind resource can make to increasing the production of electricity from renewable energy sources. In October last year I, in conjunction with my colleague, Sir Reg Empey, MLA, the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, published a report entitled &ldquo;Assessment of the Offshore Wind Energy Resources in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland&rdquo;. This document acknowledges the <Col N="127" /> resource and provides a broad overview to developers of the potential resource offshore. There are currently four companies with licenses to investigate the suitability of seven offshore sites for the construction of wind parks to generate electricity.</P>
    <P>Any support measure specific to offshore development will require prior clearance by the European Commission, under State aid rules. A standard condition of State aid applications is the submission of data on eligible costs and levels of aid intensity. This data can be estimated only under reasonable assumptions after the current exploratory works are concluded. I will discuss appropriate support measures with the industry, with a view to submitting a proportionate support mechanism to the European Commission for clearance under State aid rules, as soon as objective data from the exploratory works now under way are available.</P>

      <P>I understand that the ESB has no firm plans to stand down any of its generating plant in Dublin at present. However, as the Deputy is aware, the ESB is committed under the Tripartite Agreement to reduce its share of the generation market. This represents a significant challenge for the ESB in the context of tight overall generation margins and some uncertainty as to the exact timing of the entry of new independent generation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the commission for electricity regulation &ndash; CER &ndash; has responsibility for regulating terms for connection to and use of the transmission and distribution systems and related charges. Towards the end of last year, the CER advised me of a problem in the Dublin region in allowing new power plants firm access to the network in advance of completion of reinforcements to the transmission system.</P>
      <P>In the interests of security of supply and the promotion of competition, I responded by requesting the CER to examine and implement as a matter of urgency, in conjunction with the national grid, the measures that need to be taken to resolve this matter quickly. The CER has been engaged in a comprehensive consultation process on this issue, which I understand is nearing conclusion.</P>

      <Quest> if there is an early warning system within her Department in respect of redundancies or business closures; if so, if businesses must participate within this system; if the system extends to the retail trade; and if she will make a statement on the matter with reference to the recent closure of three electrical shops in Dublin which closed without any notice to staff. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is no formal early warning system of redundancies within my Department, there is legislative provision under section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, requiring written notification to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of collective redundan<Col N="129" /> cies at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes place. This requirement extends to the retail trade.</P>
      <P>Under Section 9 (1) of that Act, employers who propose to create what are known as collective redundancies must consult the employees' representatives at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes place. Section 6(1) of that Act defines collective redundancy as dismissals for one or more reasons not related to the individual concerned e.g. cessation of trading, rationalisation etc. Section 6(1) also stipulates the minimum number of employees that must be affected in order to qualify as a collective redundancy viz. (a) at least five in an establishment normally employing more than 20 and fewer than 50 employees, (b) at least ten in an establishment normally employing at least 50 but fewer than 100 employees, (c) at least 10% of the number of employees in an establishment normally employing at least 100 but fewer than 300 employees, and (d) at least 30 in an establishment normally employing 300 or more employees.</P>
      <P>Where an employer carries on business at more than one location, or establishment as the Act refers to it, as appears to be the case here, section 6(3)(f2&gt;b) of the Act states that such an &lsquo;establishment', including wholesale or retail shops, shall be taken to be a separate location, with account being taken under section 6(3)(f2&gt;c) of employees based at a particular establishment but who also perform some of their duties elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In a situation where a place of employment closes without any notice to staff, redress can be obtained through the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991, which is administered by my Department. In the first instance, employees concerned should contact the employment rights information section which will give them the relevant information. The address is Davitt House, Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, and the telephone No. is (01) 6313131. These Acts lay down minimum periods of notice which must be given by employers to employees normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and who have at least 13 weeks continuous service with the same employer. The period varies according to length of service, ranging from one weeks minimum notice for employment between 13 weeks and two years, with two weeks minimum notice for employment between two and four years, to a total of eight weeks minimum notice for employment of more than 15 years. Where notice is not given, the Acts do not preclude agreement between employer and employee for payment of wages in lieu of notice.</P>
      <P>Disputes about such matters may be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal which comes under the remit of my Department. The tribunal may award compensation to an employee whose employer has not given the employee the appropriate statutory notice.</P>

      <P>Motor insurance is compulsory in accordance with road traffic legislation, for which our colleague, the Minster for the Environment and Local Government, has responsibility. The Department supervises insurance companies, from the overall financial solvency perspective in accordance with EU directives. Since the abolition of price controls in 1986, there is no longer a domestic statutory requirement on the industry, to seek prior approval of, nor are insurers required to justify, price increases to our Department. Furthermore, prior approval or systematic notification of scales of premiums is also prohibited by domestic insurance legislation &ndash; S.I. No. 359 of 1994 &ndash; which gives effect to the Third Non-Life Insurance Framework Directive. That directive was adopted by the EU, as part of the completion of the Internal Market, some years ago. Our Department has therefore no function in relation, to either prior approval, or prior notification, of price changes; nor can our department intervene, in particular underwriting decisions, by insurance companies, in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance price movements are normally based on underwriting experience, as well as trends in the level, frequency and cost, past and potential, of claims, and are a matter for judgment by individual private insurance companies. Decisions on the risks, that the companies are prepared to <Col N="132" /> underwrite, are also a matter for the companies themselves. The primary focus of initiatives, aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated costs of settling the consequent claims. The decision of this Government to establish a personal injuries assessment board, by next year, is being pursued by an implementation group. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board will be reporting towards the end of this year. I will take whatever further action is appropriate towards the reduction of the cost of motor insurance, after we have received and subsequently examined the report.</P>

These programmes included the Operational Programme on Transport, 1994 to 1999, the Cohesion Fund, the Ireland &ndash; Wales Maritime INTERREG Community Initiative, 1994 to 1999. This series of investment programmes has transformed the port sector. In addition to infrastructural developments, the structure of the ports industry has been subject to major changes as the Government has focused on improving the commerciality of ports since and through the introduction of new ports legislation, the Harbours Act, 1996, and the Harbours (Amendment) Act, 2000. Over the period 1994-2000 the operational programme for transport provided aid of £30.83 million supporting a total investment of £74.65 million.

    <P>The Ireland-Wales INTERREG Programme, 1994-1999 helped enhance the impact of Structural Funds investment in Ireland over the past few years. It supported significant, additional infrastructure investment in Irish ports, improving the linkages between the two coastal zones, and also developing the access routes on which Ireland places greatest reliance for its trade with the rest of the EU. EU aid of £20.502 million under this measure supported total investment of £55.47 million to a range projects along the east coast. Projects which received grant aid assistance include:</P>

      <Col N="134" /> Official statistics published by the Central Statistics Office indicate that throughput through Irish ports increased by some 38% over the period 1994-1999. In 1999, the latest year for which official throughput figures are published by the Central Statistics Office in the annual Statistical Release &ndash; Statistics of Port Traffic, 42.938 million tonnes of goods were handled by Irish ports. It is estimated by my Department that the total throughput &ndash; approximately 45.5 million tonnes &ndash; of port traffic for 2000 was some 6% greater than in 1999. Actual throughput figures for 2000 and for the first quarter of 2001 are not yet available. Investment in ports improved capacity and quality of port facilities. The growth in Ireland's international trade and in port activity means that continued investment is required. This will be provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy is the statutory performance audit of the eight port companies which were corporatised on 3 March 1997 in accordance with the Harbours Act, 1996, and the companies' memorandum and articles of association. I am advised that the independent consultant undertaking the task is nearing completion of his work. These audit findings will inform future policy directions for the State ports industry. There is a process involved here. All the port companies involved will be invited to make a formal submission on the results of the audits. Boards will be given a chance to have their say and input on the finalised report.</P>

    <P>I am obliged, in accordance with section 29(2) of the Harbours Act, 1996, to submit the report to Government and in order to ensure balance, particularly in relation to criticism(s), each <Col N="135" /> board's view will also be put on the table. I will be addressing the findings overall in a positive and proactive light and, working with the port companies, will seek to address deficiencies identified and make improvements where possible. Given that the reports will contain commercially sensitive information pertaining to individual port companies, the extent to which results will be published is a matter for further consideration.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, section 15 of the Harbours Act, 1996, makes provisions with respect to sale, leasing and acquisition of land for commercial State port companies. Section 15 of the Act provides that a decision by a company to acquire or to dispose of any of its land shall only be made by the directors of the company; that the consideration for which any land is sold by a company shall, in so far as is practicable, not be less than its open market value; that a company shall have regard to Government guidelines in relation to the acquisition of land by State enterprises; and that any acquisition will be the subject of an independent valuation.</P>
      <P>The decisions to acquire and dispose of the said properties were taken through the board, in accordance with section 15 of the Harbours Act, 1996, having regard to Government guidelines which are extant, on foot of independent valuations and are minuted accordingly. The consent of the Government's contracts committee is not required for the sale or acquisition of property by commercial State port companies and therefore was not sought. Valuations were obtained for both transactions and the amounts involved were in accordance with the valuations. I am taking advice on the propriety of providing the further information sought and I will communicate further with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to inform the Deputy that, under the national development plan, major progress has been made in improving the public transport system in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Bus Átha Cliath took delivery of 125 new buses in 2000 to provide new and additional services. By the end of this year a further 156 new buses will have replaced older buses in the fleet. These new buses, all low floor and wheelchair accessible, have not only improved the quality and reliability of the bus service but have also increased the capacity on routes and increased the frequency during peak hours. The eight Quality Bus Corridors &ndash; QBCs &ndash; now in operation around the city have helped to reduce the bus journey times by up to 40% in some cases. The Nitelink has proved to be an outstanding success and is now available all year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commuters in the greater Dublin area are also benefiting from the enhanced services provided by Bus Éireann on all the main radial routes into Dublin, with buses leaving every 15 minutes dur<Col N="137" /> ing peak hours from towns like Navan and Drogheda.</P>
    <P>Improvements on the rail side include the delivery of ten new DART carriages introduced by Iarnród Éireann late last year, 16 being currently introduced with a further 12 DART carriages on order for delivery later this year. There is also an option on a further 36 DART carriages. The new investment in the DART service will increase capacity on the DART by almost 50% by the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>Some 20 diesel rail cars were delivered last year and a further 60 Arrow rail cars have been ordered under the NDP with delivery commencing in 2002. As well as the improvement in rolling stock, improvements in availability and frequencies of services are also under way.</P>
    <P>Other major elements of the public transport programme to be implemented over the next five years are: the introduction of the Luas light rail system in 2003; the continued enhancement, extension, and development of the Dublin Bus network, including increases in capacity, improvements in the quality of service, accessibility to those who may be mobility impaired and extended timetabling; extension of the quality bus corridor network; development of the proposed new metro system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>I would not disagree that 200mw of renewable energy based electricity equates to more than 650 million units of electricity. This is not to say that AERV will definitely seek 200 MW of capacity. AERV will be conducted in accordance with Directive 93/38/EEC, as last amended, on procurement of electricity. Legal advice available to me is that no publication of the contents of AERV should take place before the date of dispatch of the notice to the Official Journal in compliance with the provisions of Article 21(1)(f2&gt;a) of the directive. As a notice will be dispatched shortly, I am therefore precluded from commenting definitively on the capacity which will be offered in AERV at this time.</P>
      <P>The AER programme is an intervention in the market to support the production of electricity from renewable energy sources. As such it constitutes a state aid which must be cleared by the European Commission under state aids rules. The European Commission's Community Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection &ndash; 2001/C 37/03 &ndash; clearly signals that any payment above an open market price must be cost based, proportionate and justified. In addition section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act provides that the additional costs to the ESB of purchasing green electricity above an open market price will be charged to electricity consumers generally. There is therefore a double imperative to ensure the tariff paid to generators is cost oriented.</P>
      <P>Again, I am precluded from making any definitive statement on the detail of AERV, including prices other than to say, in general terms, that the prices which will be accepted in AERV will be what is necessary to provide a reasonable business case to deliver the capacity announced and to ensure investor confidence.</P>
      <P>In AER III the failure of some projects to achieve planning consent was a significant impediment identified by the renewable energy strategy group in its report Strategy for Intensifying Wind Energy Deployment. I am considering the report's recommendation to address this impediment but again I am precluded from making a definitive statement on a term of AERV at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union provides assistance of a technical and financial nature to eastern European countries aimed at improving the level of nuclear safety in those countries. The objective of the EU's programme of assistance for these countries, which is largely implemented under the Phare and Tacis programmes, is, in the short-term, to upgrade the operational safety of the older nuclear reactors, which do not meet western safety standards and the nuclear regulatory regime. The EU objective is to bring about the closure of those nuclear power plants which cannot be upgraded to or do not meet western safety standards.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the EU programmes of assistance is the responsibility of the EU Commission. The Commission is responsible for ensuring the efficient and cost-effective implementation of the programmes and has systems in place for monitoring the progress and results of the various projects implemented. In turn, the Commission's management of these programmes is audited by the EU Court of Auditors. The EU Court of Auditors has been critical of the Commission's approach in the implementation and monitoring of projects under these programmes and has recommended remedial steps which the Commission should adopt.</P>
      <P>As part of the wider international co-operation in this area, the EU has been instrumental in making available Union funds for the Chernobyl shelter fund and to facilitate the closure of three nuclear power plants in EU accession countries &ndash; Ignalina in Lithuania; Bohunice in Slovakia, and Kozluduy in Bulgaria &ndash; which do not meet and cannot be upgraded to western safety standards. Ireland, in common with other member states, has already provided funds for the Chernobyl Shelter project over and above our share of the EU contribution, and has, earlier this year, pledged to provide further assistance to this project. Ireland, like other member states also, has pledged to provide financial assistance to the decommissioning support funds in respect of the three nuclear power plants mentioned above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chernobyl shelter fund and the decommissioning support funds are managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development &ndash; EBRD &ndash; an independent financial institution which, provides all the services for integrated fund management, including control of contributions, asset management, preparation and implementation of grant agreements, procurement, budget and disbursement control.  The administrative budget and the financial operations of the Chernobyl shelter fund and the decommissioning support funds are subject to an <Col N="140" /> annual external audit, which is presented to the assembly of contributors for review and approval.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it can be stated that there are institutions established to monitor implementation of the assistance programmes mentioned.</P>

      <P>In 1998 the International Committee on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection &ndash; ICNIRP &ndash; published guidelines concerning exposure to Radio Frequency, RF, radiation.</P>
      <P>In recent years various studies have been undertaken into the safety of mobile phones. One of the more recent and comprehensive reports was that of May 2000 in the United Kingdom, by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones, IEGMP. This report is often referred to as the Stewart Report. This report acknowledges public concern about safety of mobile phones and base stations and indicates that following discussions with the mobile manufacturers forum the group understood that all mobile phones marketed in the United Kingdom complied with the ICNIRP guidelines. I have no reason to believe that the position is any different in Ireland. This report indicates that purchasers of mobile phones should have the information to allow them to make informed choices about personal exposure resulting from their use.</P>
      <P>Exposure is assessed by a parameter called specific absorption rate, SAR. It is important that there is an agreed and accepted way for measuring this parameter. The report notes that an international standard testing protocol for the assessment of SAR values should be available soon. It recommends that this international standard should be adopted once it has been demonstrated to be scientifically sound.</P>
      <P>I support the need for a scientifically sound international standard testing protocol for the assessment of exposure from mobile phones and once the position on an agreed standard becomes clearer I will ask my officials to examine how best the information should be made available to consumers.</P>

      <P>My long-term proposals for public <Col N="141" /> transport reflect a new Government commitment to renew and develop our public transport systems as part of a Government strategy to achieve sustainable and balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, there will be a major public transport investment programme comprising investments to ensure improvements in mainline rail, urban public transport and national public transport services. Under the NDP the greater Dublin area would receive public transport investment of £1,585 million and the regions outside the greater Dublin area would be receive funding of the order of £650 million.</P>
      <P>I am also embarking on a process of regulatory and institutional reform to revitalise public transport and to find effective solutions to congestion. These proposals were set out in a Government consultation paper, published in September 2000, entitled A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, which dealt with regulation of the bus market in the greater Dublin area and set out proposals for institutional reform of public transport. I am awaiting the response of the Public Transport Partnership Forum, a sub-committee of which is carrying out a comparative study in this area before submitting its views to Government.</P>
      <P>Public consultation is also taking place on the Government proposals for a new authority to deal with land use and transport in the greater Dublin area. These proposals are set out in a consultation paper entitled New Institutional Arrangements for Land Use and Transport in the greater Dublin area, published in April. It is proposed that the new strategic authority would have responsibility for strategic transport and land use planning and independent regulation of public transport.</P>
      <P>I hope to commence a review of bus market regulation outside the greater Dublin area shortly. My Department is also working on proposals for a rural transport policy. The projected launch of the rural transport initiative in June is a measure of my commitment to this area.</P>
      <P>In summary, my long-term plans and proposals are designed to spearhead a major investment and regulatory reform programme which will renew and upgrade our transport systems and thereby contribute to sustaining economic progress and promoting social cohesion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 to 72, inclusive, and 76 to 78, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for the investment of in excess of IR£1billion in the railway network. The investment will complete the safety programme; provide new and additional rolling stock; provide additional track capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 26 DART cars have been delivered to Iarnród Éireann, ten of which entered service in November 2000 and the remaining 16 are now coming into service. A further 12 DART car<Col N="143" /> riages will be delivered in 2002. These new carriages will have provided nearly a 50% increase in the capacity of the DART system by 2002.</P>
    <P>In the case of outer suburban services, 20 diesel rail cars were delivered last year to Iarnród Éireann for use on the Maynooth line. The company plans to provide an increase of 100% in peak hour capacity and a half-hourly off-peak service using the new diesel railcars purchased for the route.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has also advised me that the rail track between Maynooth and Connolly stations has been doubled and the line onwards to Kilcock has been upgraded to a high quality in recent years. Iarnród Éireann informs me that the operation of enhanced services on the Maynooth to Connolly line is awaiting the resolution of certain industrial relations issues. A full hearing before the Labour Court took place on 14 April 2001 and was adjourned to the end of May.</P>
    <P>A further 60 diesel rail cars have been ordered under the national development plan and will be delivered by end 2002-early 2003. The company has also ordered a further 20 diesel rail cars. I understand that Iarnród Éireann has also commenced the tendering process in relation to new mainline rail carriages as provided for in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The national development plan recommended the provision of two additional tracks on the Dublin-Kildare line between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch to separate long distance and suburban services. Iarnród Éireann has informed me that it has completed preliminary design work, and are now engaged in detailed design work including site investigations. I am assured by the company that adequate safety standards prevail on all rail routes, including the Maynooth-Connolly line.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, the capacity of the DART will have increased by 50% by 2002 and there will be a 100% increase in peak hour capacity on the Maynooth line on the introduction of the new Arrow service. On the delivery of further additional rolling stock in 2002-03 further capacity increases will be provided on suburban rail services. Increases in the capacity of mainline services are planned following the introduction of new mainline rail carriages as provided for in the national development plan.</P>

      <P>The telecommunications market in Ireland was fully liberalised with effect from 1 December, 1998 and competition is developing among operators in the market.</P>
      <P>In July 2000 the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to strengthen competition in the electronic communications markets in the EU for the benefit of consumers and European economy. This package of proposals represents a comprehensive reform of the regulatory framework for telecommunications in Europe and is aimed at providing the best conditions for a dynamic and competitive industry in Europe. Negotiations on the five new draft directives are ongoing between the European Council, the Commission and the member states with a view to reaching a consensus by year-end.</P>
      <P>Operators in Ireland apply technical standards developed by the industry in co-operation with international bodies such as ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Relevant technical standards are also applied at EU level and are harmonised across the Community under existing EU directives. My Department is also close to finalising the transposition of a directive on radio and telecommunications terminal equipment, which provides for a new lighter regime governing the placing on the market within the EU of telecommunications and radio equipment and the assessment of the conformity of the equipment with relevant standards.</P>
      <P>As well as these developments my Department is providing support under the national development plan for further investment in the sector. The level of progress I have outlined should ensure that Ireland is well positioned with regard to the implementation of the latest technical and regulatory standards as and when they become available.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for managing crowding and safety on trains is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann. However, I am very much aware of the discomfort that passengers have experienced due to overcrowding on trains over recent years. This is due to the continuing growth in passenger numbers and has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods on some routes, in particular weekday DART and suburban routes, and on intercity services at weekends.</P>
      <P>I have advised the House previously that there are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officers have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing their attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review. In addition, the chief railway inspecting officer has raised particular aspects of crowding on rail services with Iarnród Éireann and this is being followed up at present.</P>
      <P>In February 2001, an independent review of Iarnród Éireann's strategy for controlling crowding on commuter trains in the Dublin area was completed. The consultants, who were commissioned by Iarnród Éireann, identified various options open to Iarnród Éireann to control crowding. I understand that Iarnród Éireann is considering these options at present.</P>

      <P>I have indicated my views on the issue of an &lsquo;open-skies' agreement between the EU and US on many occasions. At the Transport Council meeting on 21 December 2000, I again reiterated Ireland's opposition to the idea of a transatlantic common aviation area. The current Ireland-US bilateral air service agreement contains specific measures intended to ensure balanced regional development in Ireland. The Irish Government is concerned that a multilateral agreement between the EU and the US could jeopardise these measures.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangements governing access to Dublin and Shannon for services between Ireland and the US were agreed with the United States in 1993 and were designed to ensure that during every 12 month period commencing 1 April, any airline serving the Ireland-US market must, taking all of its flights on all routes together, operate as least as many flights to Shannon as to Dublin. My Department monitors the operations of all airlines operating such services to ensure that this requirement is complied with.</P>

      <P>The military authorities issued their decision on the application on 12 June 1998. They advised him that the records sought did not come within the scope of relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, except in so far as the request related to &lsquo;personal information', as provided for in the Act. In this regard, he was advised that he could have access to all personal information contained in his file for the period in question and could photocopy the documents to which access had been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the individual, through his legal representatives, exercised his right to appeal the decision to the designated FOI internal appeals officer in the Defence Forces. The appeal was considered by the relevant officer, who decided to uphold the initial decision. This decision was issued in writing to the applicant's legal representatives on 20 July 1998. When conveying his decision, the internal appeals officer advised the applicant of his statutory right of further appeal to the information <Col N="148" /> commissioner. The information commissioner functions as an independent officer with statutory powers to review decisions made by public bodies in relation to FOI applications. I understand that in July 1998 such an appeal was lodged in this case with the office of the information commissioner. This appeal is a matter for the office of the information commissioner. However, I understand from inquiries to that office that the case was suspended in July 1998 at the request of the applicant's then legal representatives and was subsequently discontinued by the information commissioner's office in 1999, due to the subsequent non-pursuance of the matter by the individual concerned and his legal representatives at that time.</P>

      <P>Civil servants who travel on official duty more than five miles from home or headquarters for five hours or more are paid a subsistence allowance in accordance with Circular 11/82. The amount paid is dependent on the civil servant's grade and salary. At present, general service grades who earn more than the 8th point of the clerical officer scale are paid £9.02 for absences of five hours or more but less than ten hours. Other officers are paid £8.26 for similar absences.</P>
      <P>Most industrial civil servants come under the State industrial employees subsistence scheme which is not the same as the scheme which applies to the general service grades as detailed in Circular 11/82. At present, they receive £7.61 for absences over the dinner interval and £7.09 for absences after dinner. Many industrial employees also receive an &ldquo;eating on site&rdquo; allowance at £1.13 per day or a meal allowance at £1.88 per day. The two schemes evolved due to the different work practices which exist between general service grades and industrial civil servants.</P>
      <P>General service and industrial subsistence rates are updated annually by my Department. However, my Department is not involved in the day to day administration of subsistence payments in other Departments or offices, but it does expect Departments and offices to make payments as efficiently as possible in accordance with the regulations and rates in force at a particular time. At present, my Department is not aware of any delays in the payment of subsistence allowances to industrial civil servants and this issue has not been raised by the staff unions.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. In 1985, my Department issued guidelines to health boards on the criteria applicable in assessing priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment. The guidelines are based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion which prioritises need for treatment.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on orthodontic services, The Moran Report, recommended that all health boards use the same severity index to determine need and that provision of orthodontic treatment should continue on the basis of priority need. There have been discussions between my Department and representatives of the health board chief executive officers on the report and its implications. Proposals in the report are being progressively implemented. Amendments to the 1985 guidelines are being finalised with the health board chief executive officers and the review group on orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at £26 per night, subject to a maximum of £260 in any 12 month period, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, and neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter. Health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. In this instance, the chief executive officer of the then Eastern Health Board considered this particular <Col N="152" /> case and following a clinical review by a health board consultant cardiologist decided there were no grounds on which to allow the request for payment of the private hospital bill by the health board. The person involved was advised of the outcome of the review on 1 March, 2000.</P>

      <P>The Health Act, 1947, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. The control of infectious diseases is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards. The report of the working party on tuberculosis, established to evaluate policy on the prevention and treatment of the disease and make appropriate recommendations, was published in 1996. The report made recommendations for the disease's prevention and treatment. The recommendations covered a range of issues including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management, and laboratory diagnosis. As recommended in the report, a permanent committee, the National Tuberculosis Committee, was established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis. It is developing such a strategy at present and keeps under review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, established in 1998, has enabled an improved level of surveillance of infectious disease. The centre assists in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases. Tuberculosis is one of the priority communicable diseases under surveillance by the National Disease Surveillance Centre. The detailed surveillance being undertaken by the centre of tuberculosis will enable strategies to combat the disease to be optimised through monitoring and feedback of information about trends in incidence; identification of high risk groups and risk factors; prompt recognition of and investigation of incidents and clusters of cases; monitoring of the effectiveness of tuberculosis treatment nationally; morbidity and transmission of infection to be minimised by early diagnosis and effective treatment; the reduction of avoidable mortality; and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. My Department has requested information from the ERHA on the number of patients admitted to hospitals suffering from tuberculosis in each of the past five years. It has not responded in the time available. The information will be provided to the Deputy as soon as it is received.</P>

      <P>As part of the Eastern Regional Health Authority's service plan for 2001, a commitment was given to review the structure and process of care for adult patients with diabetes mellitus within its area of responsibility. A task force was established to carry out the review which will detail the burden of illness and service provision within the region. The report of the group will form the basis of an effective strategy for managing diabetes mellitus. The objectives of the review group are to review the burden of illness under the headings mortality, morbidity, prevalence and outcomes and to review the services within the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 to 109, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this issue came to light, my Department requested the health boards to conduct a detailed <Col N="158" /> examination of records in order to establish the extent to which the administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date had occurred in the period January 1998 to December 2000. The boards have not yet completed this exercise and I will provide the Deputy with a comprehensive report as soon as all relevant information has been received. The information provided to date suggests that in excess of 11,000 doses were administered out-of-date. Of this quantity approximately 5,000 doses were administered more than one month after their expiry date. It should be noted that in any one year period some 200,000 doses of oral polio vaccine are administered to approximately 100,000 children as part of the primary and booster childhood immunisation programmes.</P>
    <P>I requested expert advice in relation to the safety and efficacy aspects of this issue from the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee has advised that the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should therefore be repeated in such cases. My Department wrote to the chief executive officers of the health boards advising them that parents of any children who received any dose of oral polio vaccine more than one month after its expiry date should be contacted and advised of the need to have the immunisation repeated. The health boards were asked to advise general practitioners and all other relevant health professionals of the situation. Health boards were requested to examine how the administration of out-of-date vaccines occurred and the measures which should be put in place to prevent a recurrence. This matter has also been brought to the attention of the Irish College of General Practitioners which has been asked to review the matter and to consider the development of protocols in respect of vaccine administration.</P>
    <P>In view of the level of administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date my Department requested health boards to examine all childhood immunisation records to determine if children were given out-of-date vaccine. Health boards were asked to examine systems and procedures currently in place, identify shortcomings where these exist and put in place revised systems and procedures as a matter of urgency. They were also been asked to take appropriate measures in respect of vaccines administered from this point forward to ensure the validation of all key information, that is, patient name, batch number and expiry date by cross reference to registration and supply databases. Also, the chief executive officers of the health boards established a national immunisation steering committee, which is addressing a wide range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme. This will consider the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date, <Col N="159" /> and ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means and there are two categories of eligibility. Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of public health services free of charge. Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, have limited eligibility for health services, including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges. Charges for care for nursing homes or hospitals may be made under a number of regulations set out below. The constitutionality of these regulations has not been tested. Charges for long stay care can be made under two sets of regulations. They can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
      <P>Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges. In practice, however, persons in health board long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the board meets the cost of all of the person's health needs and, thus, the person ceases to qualify for a medical card in accordance with the criteria laid down in section 45 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public hospital statutory charges are based on the principle that those who can afford to do so should make a contribution towards the cost of providing hospital services. There are a number of exemptions to the charge, including medical card holders. Where the exemptions do not apply the charge may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. In <Col N="160" /> deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs.</P>
    <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Private patients are liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants fees in addition to the statutory charges. Where one opts to be treated privately, the matter of consultant fees is a private arrangement between the patient and the consultant and I have no function in this matter.</P>
    <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. The placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. I have no function in relation to the setting of private nursing home fees. Nonetheless, the State recognises the contributions paid towards the cost of private nursing home care by allowing these charges to be offset against tax liabilities. The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the commission on health funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant or by obtaining a private bed. All persons, including medical card holders, who opt for private treatment are liable for any expenses they incur.</P>

      <P>As asthma is not a notifiable disease, there are no precise statistics available on the number of people with the condition. Information regarding the number of persons suffering from asthma who were admitted to hospitals in the Eastern <Col N="161" /> Regional Health Authority area for each of the past five years is not routinely collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items is in place for the general medical services and drug payment schemes to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available, additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis. A comprehensive range of medicinal products authorised and recommended in the treatment of asthma, including inhalers, are included on the list. Nebulisers are supplied to both general medical services and non GMS patients via arrangements made by health boards.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place to meet the needs of persons with asthma.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the report of the ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme which identified a number of issues on the operation of the scheme. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, will bring proposals to Government about whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the nursing homes regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from the 1 January 1999. It was decided that monies should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million. A group representing the Department, health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this pro<Col N="163" /> cess is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as you can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible. On the particular case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>My Department contacted the relevant UK authorities and was advised that leachate from the Great Orton mass burial site in Cumbria is collected and treated with lime to destroy any foot and mouth disease virus which might be present. The leachate is then tankered to Workington sewage treatment plant and admixed with domestic sewage which receives primary treatment before discharge to the marine environment via a long sea outfall &ndash; approximately 2 kilometres. The addition of the leachate is not considered to make a significant difference to the environmental impact arising from such a discharge. UK authorities indicate that this disposal route represents the least-risk option and that survey work in the area of the outfall has not detected any significant change in measured parameters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006, together with the community support framework and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, form the strategic policy context for the improvement of the national road <Col N="165" /> infrastructure to 2006. The National Roads Authority &ndash; NRA &ndash; has to promote within this framework the detailed programming of the work required by the plan and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities and the private sector in the context of public private partnerships, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects. The national development plan provides for major improvement works to be carried out on the N5. With the exception of specified major inter-urban routes to be developed to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard, the road improvement works, including type of road, to be undertaken under the NDP will be a matter for the NRA and local authorities concerned, having regard to current and projected traffic volumes.</P>
    <P>The need for the development of new routes to augment those mentioned in the plan, will be evaluated over the period to 2006. Where the need for a new route is established, funding will be provided for the advance planning and design of the route in the plan period, with a view to bringing the project to construction within an appropriate time frame. In accordance with the White Paper on Rural Development, the proposals for the improvement of the national road network contained in the national development plan and the economic and social Infrastructure operational programme had regard to their likely impact on rural communities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Allocations for 2001 in relation to the non-national roads programme, which amount in total to a record £322 million, were fully made to all local authorities. It is a matter for individual local authorities to select particular tertiary and other road lengths for improvement or maintenance under these general allocations. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has benefited considerably from the significantly increased funding available in recent years for non-national roads. The council's 2001 non-national road grant allocation is £12.631 million, an increase of 162% over total payments to it in 2000. I am satisfied <Col N="166" /> that this level of funding, supplemented by the council's own resources, is appropriate to its current and ongoing needs in the non-national roads area.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02, announced last July. Given the council's priority rating to the scheme, the level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme then.</P>

      <P>Access officers have been appointed in each county council and county borough council. Compliance with part M of the building regulations is primarily a matter for the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. Building control authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the regulations. Since my appointment as Minister in 1997, I have urged local authorities to actively enforce all parts of the building regulations, including part M. In particular, my Department's circular letter BC 7/99 of 17 June 1999 specifically called for stricter enforcement of part M. I sanctioned the appointment of building control officers and increased building control fees to fund stricter local enforcement. At present, 85% of authorities are carrying out inspections. About two thirds of authorities have achieved the target level of inspection &ndash; 12%-15% of developments &ndash; and <Col N="167" /> I told the remaining authorities that they must do so by 30 June 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on the annual sales of bituminous products is not available in my Department. Petroleum bitumen is used in two forms. Penetration grade bitumen is used in the manufacture of road pavement materials and bitumen emulsions are used in the surface dressing of new and existing roads. Tar is no longer used in road pavement maintenance. The most commonly used bitumen emulsion product is cationic bitumen emulsion &ndash; 70% binder content &ndash; for which the average January prices per tonne was £145.66 in 1997, £137.35 in 1998, £132.71 in 1999, £172.95 in 2000 and £186.80 in 2001. Costs of bitumen, an oil based product, reflect prevailing international oil prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority advertises for suppliers to tender for the supply of bituminous emulsion products to local authorities twice a year, in December and June. An approved list of suppliers is made available by the NRA to local authorities, and they generally enter into arrangements with supplier(s) for the supply of bituminous products for six months. The quality of bitumen emulsion is monitored on behalf of the NRA. This involves testing samples of products supplied to local authorities. My Department pro<Col N="168" /> vides a contribution to the NRA for the non-national road element of such testing. The NRA monitors the test results and has the power to suspend a supplier from the approved list should they fail to supply bitumen to the standard of the NRA's specification requirements.</P>

      <P>On 25 April 2001 notification of a change of ownership for the vehicle in question was received from the garage disposing of the vehicle by my Department's vehicle registration unit located in Shannon, County Clare. The following day, a vehicle licensing certificate &ndash; VLC &ndash; in the new owner's <Col N="171" /> name was issued by the vehicle registration unit. Taxi licences in respect of the Dublin taximeter area are granted by Dublin Corporation. A conditional offer for the grant of a taxi licence may be made by the corporation upon application. The taxi licence would be granted following presentation of relevant documentation required by the corporation which includes vehicle certification by national car testing service &ndash; NCTS &ndash; or the Garda, evidence that use of the vehicle as a taxi is covered by insurance and payment of the taxi licence fee of £5,000. It would appear that the next step for the person concerned is to make an application to the corporation for the taxi licence.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the <Col N="172" /> security and social support of vulnerable older people.</P>
      <P>Since its commencement, a total of £22 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people can apply. My Department does not direct individuals to make their applications through any particular voluntary or community group and indeed supported 571 organisations under the scheme last year. The scheme has operated in this manner since it was first introduced in 1996. Details of all organisations receiving funding under the scheme have been made available to the Houses of the Oireachtas Library each year since 1996 for the information of members. A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend the scheme.</P>

      <P>The two EU directives cited by the Deputy have been adopted by the EU Council of Ministers pursuant to Article 13 of the treaty establishing the European Union, which allows the Union to take action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The first directive, the &ldquo;Race&rdquo; Directive-2000/43/EC, binds member states to implement the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin; the second directive, the Employment and Occupation Directive-2000/78/EC, establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Under the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, discrimination on the grounds covered by Article 13 is already prohibited.</P>
      <P>Article 16 of the race directive fixes 19 July 2003 as the date by which member states shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative procedures necessary to comply with that directive. In the case of the employment and occupation directive, the date as fixed by Article 18 of that directive for its implementation by member states is 2 December 2003, with an extension possible, to take account of particular conditions, until 2 December 2006 to implement the directive's provisions on age and disability discrimination.</P>
      <P>Both directives are being examined by my Department with a view to transposition. The extent of amendments to current Irish legislation needed to give effect to the directives is under consideration. At this stage, I am not in a position to give details of the precise amendments to be made.</P>

However, in general, asylum seekers do not have the right to work pending a final decision on their applications. However, as an exceptional measure, the Government agreed on 26 July 1999, that those asylum seekers who were in this country for more than 12 months and who were awaiting a final decision on their application for refugee status should be given the right to work. The arrangement applied to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July 1999, as soon as they crossed the 12 month threshold. The arrangement did not apply to persons who applied for asylum after 26 July 1999.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that detailed statistics in relation to the number of fatal and serious injury accidents on Irish roads are provided by the National Roads Authority, St. Martin's House, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4. The most recent report is in respect of 1999. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the provisional figure for fatal accidents for the year 2000 is 362, in which there were 415 fatalities; the 1999 equivalent figure is 374 fatal accidents, with 413 fatalities. I am also informed that figures for the number of serious injury accidents and details of drivers involved in such accidents for the year 2000, who were holders of provisional licences, are not readily available. It would take a considerable amount of Garda time to compile such information.</P>

    <P>I refer the Deputy to the Government's national strategy on road safety in which there is a commitment given by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce a national vehicle driver file. This should <Col N="177" /> facilitate the provision of the type of information sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Dublin 12 local drugs task force, comprising the districts of Crumlin, Drimnagh, Kimmage and Walkinstown, action plan was submitted to the national drugs strategy team in July 2000. It was assessed by the team, which recommended that phase one of the plan be allocated funding of £510,500. This allocation will fund a total of 15 projects in the Dublin 12 area and was approved by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion in January 2001.</P>
      <P>An extensive consultation process was undertaken by the local drugs task force in the drawing up of the action plan. This included the circulation of a questionnaire to all houses on Walkinstown Avenue concerning the views of the residents in October 1998, and a meeting in May 1999 to select a person from the community to represent the area on the task force. In addition, a community forum for all of the residents of the Dublin 12 area was held in November 1999 in order to get the views of the local community in preparation of the plan. In December 1999, the task force also employed the services of a facilitator to work with the Walkinstown community to help it identify the priority services needed in the area.</P>
      <P>The centre referred to by the Deputy is a proposed resource centre for young people of the Walkinstown-Greenhills area which it is hoped will provide support services, advice and information on drug related issues for young people of the area.</P>
      <P>The national drug strategy team did not recommend that the centre be funded at this time, but rather that the proposal will be considered in the context of phase two funding of the task force, which will commence when all the phase one applications from the task forces have been completed.</P>

      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out, as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum, £20 per pupil in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion regarding the appointment of secretarial and caretaking staff and the level and extent of service provided. My Department has no function with regard to the appointment of staff under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The school in question is currently funded under the PESP scheme in respect of secretarial services. A payment of £5,900 will issue shortly to the school in respect of secretarial services for the year 2001. This is based on the school's enrolment of 295 pupils on 30 September 2000. The school currently has the services of a full-time caretaker employed under this Department's 1979 scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on Autism is comprised of people with a wide range of expertise and experience in the education of children with autism. The task force has also had the benefit of presentations from experts in the field of autism from the United States and Northern Ireland. In addition, the task force has received and considered more than 100 submissions from interested parties.</P>
      <P>I understand the task force expects to hold its final meetings during this month and to present its report shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>The remit of the task force was to review the adequacy of the current range of educational responses to children with autism, including responses based on the applied behavioural analysis method, and to make recommendations on the future development of services for the children in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has engaged the UK based National Foundation for Educational Research to carry out an independent evaluation of all current <Col N="181" /> State funded models of response to children with autism. The evaluation will include school based models in special and integrated settings, models using the applied behavioural analysis approach and cases involving home based tuition. The foundation has now commenced its work and will be contacting the facilities involved over the coming weeks. The foundation expects to present its report in October, 2001.</P>
    <P>The CABAS facility was established in 1998 as a five year pilot programme to test the appropriateness and effectiveness of the CABAS approach to the education of children with autism. It is intended that the operation of this facility will be included in the evaluation being carried out by the National Foundation for Educational Research. In the meantime, my Department has agreed to provide additional funding to facilitate a limited expansion of the CABAS project. Efforts to locate suitable accommodation for this expansion are continuing.</P>

      <P>The joint declaration of the European Ministers of Education convened in Bologna in June 1999, which was signed by 29 countries, is a commitment to establish the European area of higher education and to promote the European system of higher education in a global context. The goals of the declaration are to increase the competitiveness of the European system of higher education and to increase mobility and employability within the European area. Recognising the fundamental principles of autonomy and diversity, the establishment of the European area of higher education will be achieved by greater compatibility and comparability of the European systems of higher education.</P>
      <P>The declaration commits the signatories to engage in co-ordinating their policies to achieve the following objectives within the first decade of the third millennium: adoption of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees; adoption of a system based on two main cycles, undergraduate and graduate; establishment of a system of credit accumulation and transfer &ldquo;such as in the ECTS system&rdquo; to promote student mobility; promotion of mobility of students and teachers; co-operation in quality assurance; and promotion of the necessary European dimensions in higher education.</P>

      <P>To be eligible for a maintenance grant under the terms of the student support schemes a candidate must fulfil conditions as to residence, age, means and nationality. To fulfil the residency requirement a candidate's parents, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate her-himself, shall have been resident in the administrative area of the local authority or VEC from 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course. The local authority or VEC has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees criteria tuition fees will be paid in respect of EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to a third-level course subject to certain conditions.

It is open to any individual to forward an application to the CAO. However, the CAO-participant institutions retain the function of making decisions on admissions.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, undergraduate tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible students who have EU nationality or refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course.</P>
      <P>The maintenance grants schemes provide for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>Students entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking, eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality. Under the nationality clause of the schemes, candidates who have EU nationality, refugee status or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State, are eligible to apply for grant assistance subject to the other conditions in the schemes.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, tuition fees have been charged in respect of non-EU nationals who wish to pursue further and higher education options in colleges in this country. Asylum seekers, who are programme or convention refugees or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State, would benefit under the schemes of financial support for third-level students.</P>

Students entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking, eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality. An approved course for the purpose of the schemes is a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.</P>
      <P>The assessment of means under the grants scheme is based on gross income from all sources, with specified social welfare and health board payments being excluded from the calculation. Other than in the case of an independent mature student, the reckonable income, for the purpose of the means testing, is that of the candidate and of the candidate's parents or guardians. In cases where the parents are divorced or separated, only the reckonable income of the parent, with whom the candidate resides, is taken into account.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the candidate, to whom the Deputy refers, has not applied for financial assistance under the higher education grant scheme. He should, therefore, contact the relevant local authority with a view to submitting an application for funding, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am arranging for my Department to forward <Col N="185" /> a copy of the higher education grants scheme, 2000, to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Students must be attending an undergraduate course, or a postgraduate course of not less than one-year duration, in order to be deemed eligible for assistance.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college.</P>

      <P>This year it will again be possible for a student, depending on his or her special need, to have his or her result in a subject based upon all except some element of the examination in that <Col N="186" /> subject. Drawing on best international practice this significant improvement is enabled by having an explanatory note accompany the grade.</P>
      <P>In all such cases the grade awarded is a full and accurate reflection of the candidate's performance in the examination, and the examination certificates issued by my Department state that unequivocally.</P>
      <P>This measure enables a candidate to obtain maximum marks for the subject even though his or her special need precludes him or her from demonstrating attainment in core elements of the standard assessment. In other words, the grade awarded which will subsequently be used to calculate points for third level admission purposes need no longer be based on some element of standard assessment that he/she would have difficulty with. While recognising the autonomy of third level institutions in relation to setting their admission policies, the overall policy thrust is to ensure increased participation by those with special needs at third level and I fully expect this measure to assist in that regard. It is also consistent with the Report of the Commission on the Points System which set out the need to facilitate, in every way possible, those with special needs both in terms of initial access to third level and thereafter in terms of their needs while at third level.</P>
      <P>My Department keeps the arrangements that are made for examination candidates with special needs under constant review and assessment, with a view to making appropriate improvements to those arrangements. This is achieved primarily through meeting groups representing those with particular disabilities and through contact with the National Disability Authority.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the 2000 examinations our review of the operation of these arrangements has resulted in a further improvement for 2001. A candidate who has a specific learning difficulty can now apply for an exemption from the spelling component of a language subject even if that candidate's difficulty is not severe enough to warrant the grant of a scribe or tape-recorder.</P>

      <P>Whole school evaluation, WSE, is designed to fulfil my obligations under the Education Act, 1998 with respect to school and system evaluation and, in tandem with school <Col N="187" /> development planning, the achievement of improved quality in education at school level.</P>
      <P>The consultation process leading to the mainstream introduction of WSE is still in place. The views and advice of all the education partners have contributed to the continuing development of WSE, support for which is evident in the wide-ranging consensus achieved through the design and pilot project phases. It is my intention to introduce WSE at the earliest possible opportunity, taking due cognisance of the perspectives of all of the partners, including the ASTI.</P>
      <P>A central element in the introduction of WSE will be the availability to schools of the criteria to be used in the school evaluation process. However, these criteria have an equally important developmental function as a tool for school self-evaluation. It is intended that schools will be able to use the criteria on a continuous basis in reviewing their own performance as part of their developmental planning process. The criteria are being finalised at present and I expect to be in a position to publish them as an aid to school self-review in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The Drumcondra English Profiles were designed to be used by teachers in profiling the progress of all pupils in their classes. The primary purpose of the Drumcondra English Profiles is to provide summative or overall indices of a pupil's achievement in oral language, reading and writing at or near the end of the school year. It is hoped that this information will be used for record keeping, and for communicating with other teachers and with parents. A secondary purpose is to provide teachers with formative information that can guide planning and teaching throughout the school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profiles were not designed to facilitate the early identification and diagnosis of pupils' reading difficulties. However, specific suggestions are given in the profiles about suitable assessment activities in oral language, reading and writing. These activities are intended to support the implementation of the English profiles. Important early skills in the area of reading, for example, are identified for teachers and suggestions are made in regard to appropriate assess<Col N="188" /> ment activities to detect a pupil's progress in areas such as emergent literacy, phonemic awareness and word identification. Serious delays or lack of progress in these areas in the case of particular pupils are generally good indicators of literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>These early skills are highlighted in the English curriculum and a wide variety of assessment instruments is used in schools by class and learning support teachers to detect and diagnose difficulties in the development of these skills. The profiles are an additional resource to schools in this work, but their use is not mandatory. The availability of the profiles will facilitate teachers in selecting and using appropriate assessment instruments for the early identification and diagnosis of pupils' reading difficulties.</P>

      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes is based on gross income from all sources with specified social welfare and health board payments being excluded from the calculation.

Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the economic benefits which would accrue to the north-west region from the establishment of a university in Athlone, the Government will, under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, appoint the necessary body to advise the Higher Education Authority on the upgrading of Athlone Institute of Technology to university status; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans at present to change the status of the institute of technology in Athlone. I do not propose therefore to appoint a body to advise the Higher Education Authority on the upgrading of the Athlone Institute of Technology to university status.</P>
      <P>In July 1996 the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector, subject to regular review. The steering committee report endorsed the maintenance of a diversified system of higher education to meet the varying needs of students, society and the economy. The report did not recommend any change in status for the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the publication of the steering committee's report arrangements were put in place for a process to enable institutes of technology to apply for delegated authority to make awards within a national qualifications framework.</P>
      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of three new bodies: the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. I established the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland on a statutory basis on 26 February last and it is my intention to establish the new awarding councils in the near future.</P>
      <P>The main objects of the Act are to establish and develop standards of knowledge, skill or competence; promote the quality of further education and training and higher education and training; provide a system for co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards and to promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides for the delegation of authority from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council &ndash; HETAC &ndash; within the framework of qualifications, to institutes of technology who may seek such powers. Under section 29 of the Act, it is open to any institute of technology <Col N="194" /> to request HETAC to delegate to it the authority to make higher education and training awards.</P>
    <P>My policy is to continue to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third-level systems of university and technological education. The diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
    <P>Athlone Institute of Technology will continue to play a major role in Irish higher education.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 413 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 371 pupils on 30 September 2000. An enrolment of 371 pupils is not sufficient to allow the retention of the 14th mainstream class teacher for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>The board of management of the school in question was notified in writing of this position on 6 April 2001.</P>
