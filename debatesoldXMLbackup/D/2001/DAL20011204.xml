    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The plenary meeting of the social partners held on 17 October focused on three key themes &ndash; the current economic outlook, the strategic review of FÁS and the national drugs strategy. The key conclusion on the economic outlook was that, while we undoubtedly face serious challenges arising from the global slowdown and the 11 September attacks, we should face them with confidence, based on our achievements in building up our economy, our record of creating new jobs and our continuing commitment to social partnership as the best way of moving forward.</P>
      <P>There were, of course, different emphases within this broad consensus and social partners raised a number of particular priorities, ranging from the need to maintain competitiveness to the need to ensure the burden of adjustment to current circumstances does not fall disproportionately on the disadvantaged. The social partners have, of course, made these concerns known separately to the Minister for Finance in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>There was a useful discussion of the proposed statement of strategy for FÁS based on a presentation by its director general. The new strategy will be focused on increasing the employability and mobility of job seekers and employees in meeting labour market needs, thereby promoting competitiveness and social inclusion. It will play a key role in responding to the current economic climate and preparing for the recovery which will follow. There was general support for the broad thrust of the strategy and agreement that particular issues and suggestions could be pursued bilaterally with FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a useful discussion of the national drugs strategy, 2001-08. The new strategy, which follows on from a comprehensive review of the overall national drugs strategy, brings together, <Col N="791" /> for the first time, all elements of drugs policy into a single framework, with responsibilities clearly assigned across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, since 1986, has produced a series of reports that have identified interrelated policy issues and put forward strategic approaches to economic and social development in a medium term perspective. These strategy reports have provided the necessary intellectual and policy framework to underpin negotiations between the Government and the social partners, leading to successive social partnership agreements. It is widely agreed, both among the social partners and among commentators at home and abroad, that this type of medium term strategic analysis, undertaken by the social partners working through the NESC, has been an essential ingredient in the success of the Irish social partnership model.</P>
    <P>Before the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness expires, and in anticipation of a further round of negotiations between the Government and the social partners in the autumn of 2002, the NESC has begun the work of preparing a new strategy document. A detailed schedule of work to be undertaken on it has been prepared and was discussed by the council at its November meeting. Further preparatory work has also been undertaken by the council's secretariat. Although the council has an extensive work programme, the strategy process is being treated as a key priority.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of formally launching the new National Centre for Partnership and Performance on 22 October, following the inaugural meeting of its council. As I indicated in my remarks on that important occasion, its role is to provide a strategic focus on the deepening of partnership and the improvement of performance in the workplace, both in the public and private sectors. The centre has been established on foot of a commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and will be located within the new National Economic and Social Development Office, alongside the NESC and NESF.</P>
    <P>Given the scope of its mandate, the centre will work in close co-operation with relevant organisations and agencies that have an interest in industrial relations and workplace development. Its core activities will include deliberation, consensus building, research and analysis, dissemination of best practice and training and facilitation.</P>
    <P>The council has commenced work on developing a strategic plan for the centre and it is envisaged the plan will be formally launched early next year. Total costs accruing to my Department to date, in respect of the new centre, amount to £181,336 or 230,249.</P>
    <P>The centre will bring added momentum to the drive for change at organisational level, leading to improvements in productivity and the delivery of public services, as well as improving the quality of working life and the work-life balance. In pro<Col N="792" /> moting enterprise level partnership, the centre has an important contribution to make in developing increased flexibility and competitiveness within companies and, ultimately, securing the long-term viability of the jobs they provide.</P>
    <P>Copies of my remarks at the launch are available in the Oireachtas Library for further reference.</P>
    <P>I meet representatives of individual social partner organisations on a regular basis. Most recently, I met ICTU and IBEC on 21 November in the context of their pre-budget submissions. I have no plans to meet the social partners collectively in the near future. I met them collectively at the PPF plenary meeting in July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the launch of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We should keep the surplus, but if we have to go back to negative borrowing, we should come back on surplus after a year or so&rdquo;. Can the Taoiseach outline what he means by negative borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean borrowing for purposes that would not be very productive for the economy. We should try as far as possible to keep our borrowing as low as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the establishment of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance and that the strategic management initiative is approximately ten years old, does the Taoiseach now feel the centre is the body that should drive the SMI process, since it is about renewal and change, particularly in the public services, as well as delivering quality public services? Does he, along with many public servants and me, share a sense that the steam behind the strategic management initiative has largely evaporated and the occasion of the establishment of the partnership centre should be used as the basis of a re-launch of what the SMI set out to do which now needs a new impetus, that is improvement in the quality of the delivery of services in the public sector and willing acceptance of change by public servants, both in Departments and in some of our State companies? Although we have FÁS, the Labour Relations Commission, the IDA, Forfás and Enterprise Ireland, that role sits more comfortably with the NCCP than any other body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a review of the SMI process at present. In its various forms there is still an amount of work going on as reported to the House on numerous occasions, through the Secretary General and the committee. As Deputy Quinn mentioned, there is a need to revamp some of the structures and this is the reason for the review by PA Consultants. I do not disagree with that. The consultants are talking to people in Departments and representatives of the staff to see what impetus they can give to the agenda. I have no doubt many issues will come out of that <Col N="793" /> review. Deputy Quinn has been at a number of the conferences, as I have, where the representatives from various working groups in different Departments and agencies have spelt out aspects they would like to see addressed. I look forward to the completion of the review and the recommendations coming from it. The new organisation clearly has a role in co-ordinating the work of NESC and NESF and in working with the public and private sector in driving the agenda for change and co-operation on management.</P>
      <P>The Deputy correctly said that is an agenda in which it can play a major role. The type of people it has attracted and who are on the board can drive that change. Its initial work is to put together a strategy. Its remit, which is broad, is to try to develop what happened in NCPP over the past three years and to bring that forward into a process of change and co-operation at ground level in organisations. Mr. Cassells and others who are involved in it are anxious to bring it to a new level. I am not ruling out the SMI process. It would be good if it also did that in the public service, although I am not sure if it wants that remit. I hope we will have the other side of the report in the next few months so that we can consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the health strategy discussed at his meeting with the social partners and, if so, was the Taoiseach surprised at the remarks made by Mr. McDonagh, SIPTU's national representative of nurses, who described the health strategy as a miserable failure? Does the Taoiseach agree that unless the Government gets the co-operation of key health personnel, such as nurses, it will be impossible to take the radical restructuring steps necessary to deliver a proper health service to the country? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss it. I outlined the issues which were discussed. We need the co-operation of the main players to implement the health strategy. The comments I heard from most of the organisations or their representatives are supportive. The strategy on the implementation of the nurses forum report is continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Taoiseach mentioned in his reply that at the review of the economic situation the events of 11 September, which were a factor, were brought into the equation. Does he agree that a number of employers and major corporations, particularly in the aviation industry, are using the tragedy of 11 September as a convenient excuse to carry out deep cuts in terms of employment and workers' conditions to a degree which is not related to 11 September but related to the desire of these companies to maintain maximum profits to the detriment of workers? Will the Taoiseach condemn that and state that it should not be used by employers as an excuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is time to reconsider the meaning of partnership? It has been one <Col N="794" /> of the main buzzwords in economic discussions and in relations between employers and workers over the past 12 years. Does the Taoiseach agree that partnership seems to be that when the economic situation is positive, employers are enabled to take super profits from the economy while workers' wages are held low in many cases, but when the economic situation changes, there is no restraint on employers, including major corporations, from shedding thousands of jobs if it suits them without giving any consideration to the vast profits they have made during the economic boom? I am referring to the multinational corporations operating in this country which repatriate £8 billion or £9 billion in profits each year. What comeback will there be for workers in the future when a downturn in the economic situation is used as an excuse to sack them? Will they be able to claw back some of the wealth they have created in good times?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me a number of very general questions. Employers have to keep their enterprises competitive, whether times are good or difficult. Times are more difficult now and employers, naturally, are focused on the competitiveness of their businesses to ensure they can sustain them in more straitened circumstances and create enough wealth to stay viable. I have no difficulty with them doing this. The Deputy has asked me to generalise about a company which does not have a competitiveness problem. I would have a difficulty if a company were to use bad times, even though it was not in difficulty, as an excuse to shed workers and eschew certain work practices. I would condemn that, but from reports on companies that I receive, particularly on those in the aviation industry, that is not happening. Companies have lost market share because an enormous amount of corporate travel has stopped and freight transport has been reduced, as have general passenger numbers. I hope this will not continue to be the case for long. Already there are indications of a swing back in some markets, though not in all.</P>
      <P>In general terms the Deputy will agree that companies have had a profitable seven or eight years. There is no doubt about this. It is not true of every firm, but the large companies have had a particularly good period and created jobs. In the last seven years 488,000 jobs have been created and with a workforce of 1.8 million we have the highest number working that we have ever had. While unemployment has marginally increased and projections are that a marginal increase will continue, these are still relatively good circumstances for employees. We must always be careful. The trade union movement uses the partnership process and its negotiating skills in the LRC and the Labour Court to ensure employers' actions are justifiable. I support it in this. I do not see any evidence to support what the Deputy has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Government gave a commitment to low-paid workers that those earning the minimum wage would no longer be required to pay income tax. Did the Taoiseach reconfirm this commitment at his meeting with the social partners? He has failed one test and did a U-turn last week by failing to extend eligibility for medical cards to low-paid persons. Can he assure the House that all those earning less than £5 per hour will be taken out of the tax net tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you really want me to answer that question, a Ceann Comhairle? In discussions during the year the Irish Congress of Trades Unions has indicated to me at all stages its welcome of the Government's introduction of the statutory minimum wage which is greater than that in practically every other European country. The ICTU's policy is to get as much of it out of the tax net as possible. That is still the position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan very much welcomes what we have done in the last four budgets to improve the medical card system, as opposed to what happened in the three previous budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to tidy up there also. On the Taoiseach's reply to the question on the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, will he confirm for the House and those interested that the remit of that new body, which I support, includes, among other things, adaptation to change, increased productivity, deepening partnership in the workplace, assisting in the next phase of modernising the public service, that is, the health service, education sector, local authorities and the Civil Service, and working with those public utilities facing major restructuring? Does the Taoiseach agree that the new body, which will build on what has already been achieved through the strategic management initiative, should have its relationship in terms of driving forward the process of change made abundantly clear? May I take it from the Taoiseach's earlier reply that PA Consultants is reviewing the work the SMI has achieved to date and will make a set of recommendations soon on the next phase? May I further anticipate that the SMI process will be reversed into part of the work programme of the NCPP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The summary the Deputy has given is absolutely correct. On the last part, a decision has not been made. I did not discuss it with the board when I had my meeting with its members nor did they ask about it. They stated they are anxious to drive the change agenda in both the public and private sectors. The public consultation process, that is, public in the context of membership of the public service, is being conducted by PA consultants. It is also addressing customers' needs as well as in terms of agencies and members of the public.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point which, if I understand him correctly, is that the strategic management initiative does not fit into any specific place nor does it have any area on which to focus and that, while it has a committee of the House, it could usefully find its place within the NCPP process. I accept that point and will examine it when the consultants' report is concluded. While it is not one which has been made to me, it is valid.</P>

      <P>On the national drugs strategy to which the Taoiseach referred in his first answer, <Col N="797" /> will he tell me, as chairman of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion which has responsibility for the strategy, whether the committee has received the promised six monthly report from the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, on the progress of the strategy? It is now seven months since it was launched and a six monthly progress report was promised.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that £5.7 million of moneys allocated to the national drugs strategy last year remains unspent? This comprises mainly capital projects which have not begun. Does he have any comment to make on the fact that large amounts of money earmarked for the national drugs strategy are not being spent and that, as far as I am aware, we still do not have the promised six monthly progress report after almost seven months? The strategy has only just been launched and we are getting off to a very bad start.</P>

      <P>A progress report, which we have cleared at the sub-committee, is to be published before Christmas.  Overall, work is going well on the report including a number of important issues, such as methadone centres, regional drug task force areas, and the implementation plan. I do not have the capital funding details but I know about some of these centres, which in many cases are community facilities. The difficulty is that some of the centres in the 13 drug task force areas to which the Minister has allocated money, have not been able to resource the local contribution, or they have had other difficulties. The Minister had that problem last year, as well; he provided additional moneys to support the centres but some of the committees were not able to get on with the task. That is what is creating the difficulty in some of the centres again this year. That is the case with one or two of them in Dublin, and I am sure it is also the case in other cities.</P>

      <P>Has there been any discussion with the social partners about the lack of progress on specific commitments in the PPF on housing? The PPF committed the Government to provide an additional 25,000 council houses in the life time of the agreement, yet only about 7,000 have been provided to date. Based on what we know from the Estimates, only about half the number of houses committed in the PPF will now be provided in the life time of the agreement. Based on those figures, does the Taoiseach accept that the Government is in breach of the PPF as regards housing? What discussions took place with the <Col N="798" /> social partners concerning this matter and what new measures are to be introduced? Will additional moneys be provided to make up the shortfall in house numbers over the remaining two years of the agreement? </P>

      <P>I outlined in my earlier reply the issues I discussed with the social partners. A separate sub-committee of the PPF is dealing with the housing issue and it has published an agenda covering what it is doing. That sub-committee deals primarily with the issue of housing, and local authority housing in particular. I am aware that the number of houses has not reached the target, and not all the houses provided for in the PPF will be constructed. While the targets will not be reached, a considerable number of houses will still be provided. The figures in the Estimates, both for this year and last year, are as much as the local authority system has been able to provide.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the Taoiseach's honesty in accepting that the targets set in the PPF for public housing will not be met. Does the Government intend to provide any additional resources to enable those targets to be met? The number of houses to be provided under the PPF was 25,000 but we have a waiting list of 60,000. The Taoiseach has now told us that even the modest target provided for in the PPF will not be met, so what will the Government do to make up the shortfall?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me return to the Taoiseach's original reply in which he referred to the three items discussed at the meeting on 17 October, one of which was the economic outlook. On his own admission, there will probably be a rise in the level of unemployment and redundancies in the forthcoming year compared to previous years. In accepting this analysis, which I think all of us do, will the Taoiseach agree that now is the time for the Government to improve the security system and, in particular, the redundancy payments system for workers who, through no fault of their own, will face redundancy? Will he agree it is time to improve the statutory redundancy payments which have remained virtually unchanged since their introduction in the late 1960s? Instead of the statutory half a week's pay for each year served up to a certain age the level of compensation should be in line with Labour Court practices, a minimum of two weeks pay per year of service. Given that the social insurance fund is in surplus this would impose no cost on the Exchequer or employers and would provide a level of comfort that would enable workers faced with redundancy to accept redundancy and avail of the opportunity to retrain and develop new skills to enable them re-enter the workforce in a different area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to the Deputy's question. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is in discussions with the Tánaiste and has brought forward proposals in the past two weeks, if I recall correctly. I have not been party to those discussions, but it has brought forward proposals for an enhanced scheme. I have outlined that it has been many years since there has been a change in the statutory position. The statutory payment, even in its earlier years, was looked on as the floor and certainly was never used as a ceiling in any discussions, even 16 or 17 years ago. There is a case for review. As I am not involved in the discussions, I do not know what the exact terms are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second issue, retraining is linked to what I said in my reply because the whole pur<Col N="800" /> pose of the FÁS new framework programme is to take the employability and retaining of individuals on board. Rather than the good work which the organisation has done in the past 13 or 14 years it is now refocusing itself away from the schemes approach, though accepting that schemes are an inevitability for some and very desirable for social reasons for others. As part of the redundancy programme, people should be offered training to enable them enhance their employability. Clearly, that is an issue. As we watch people being made redundant, it is remarkable that those with skills in what is a difficult time are the very ones who are learning new skills. Recent figures in respect of some of the people who lost their jobs in Cork and north County Dublin indicate that an enormous proportion &ndash; up to 90% &ndash; of the skilled people were able to get jobs while the unskilled people had difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any reflection or discussion on why in a time of full and plenty &ndash; which unfortunately is no longer the case &ndash; the Government was not able to achieve its housing targets or on why builders and investors were driven out of the marketplace? Has there been any review of what seems to have been a rather disastrous period of Government policies on housing? Can the Taoiseach give an indication, even at this late stage when the money is all gone, that there will be a change from the Government's disastrous approach to housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government had great difficulty getting local authorities to meet the targets they set. He had to pressurise them month after month to meet those targets when money was available. In many cases in the public sector it often appears that more money will solve the problem.</P>
      <P>There has been a slow-down in the private sector which has been partly due to the success in this area. The house inflation prices in 1997 and 1998 were unsustainable and drove first time buyer out of the market. This morning's newspapers report that most recent figures indicate there are still house price increases, but they are nothing of the order they were previously. Arguments are being made again by the House Builders Association, CIF and others for a boost to those schemes, but there is also an acceptance by them that the profit margin they were taking in many cases at that time was excessive. I hope there is a bit more realism now. I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe will agree that £100,000 a unit, as people got in certain parts of this city and in others, was excessive.</P>

Is it genuine partnership for landlords to be allowed to rackrent at will, to charge astronomical prices for houses and flats at the expense of workers who are not allowed to raise their wages at will, whose wages increases are tied quite tightly in many cases? Is it genuine partnership whereby developers, land owners and house builders were allowed to treble the price of a home in that period of four and a half years while workers' wages were pinned quite tightly?

That was the basis of his work. The percentage of first-time buyers has increased dramatically while the percentage of investors has diminished dramatically. I accept that for a variety of reasons, including that one, investors went out of the market. A proportion of them went to other countries, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, and they will continue to do that because they will make a profit, but that does not take from the fact that builders and developers had moved to a position where on each unit they were making a profit of a few thousand pounds and first-time buyers had no opportunity to get into the market.

      <P>The position is that a total of 37 personal injury claims primarily alleging post-traumatic stress disorder have been received in my Department. The Defence Forces have for some time operated a stress management and PTSD programme, the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and enable the provision of support in order that the consequences of traumatic and stressful situations can be dealt with in an appropriate and timely manner. This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the personnel support service and the chaplaincy service.</P>
      <P>Support and counselling systems are in place for those who are exposed to stress which may result in PTSD. Such counselling is believed to reduce the numbers who develop PTSD after an incident. Also for those who develop PTSD, counselling and psychiatric services are offered, either within the Army or, where this is not practicable, patients are referred to the appropriate civilian treatment centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the existence of PTSD in itself does not imply negligence, either of a medical or organisational nature. It is an integral part of a soldier's job to be exposed sometimes to stressful situations. As outlined above, coping techniques in line with best prac<Col N="805" /> tice internationally are in place and have been for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated there have been 37 claims to date. I would appreciate a breakdown of those claims. Are they from serving or retired personnel? Have they been received in recent times? Has a trend been detected? How many psychologists does the Army have? Do we have a scheme in place by which professionals visit personnel on overseas duty to discuss matters such as the dangers of overseas missions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 37 cases in all. I do not have the figure for claims made by retired and serving members of the Defence Forces. As far as I am aware, four claims have been made during 2001 to date. Post-traumatic stress disorder was first recognised in America in 1980 and not discovered to any great extent in Europe until the mid-1990s. From that time on, the psychological, chaplaincy and counselling services have been very considerably upgraded in order that stressful situations which soldiers encounter from time to time can be dealt with in a way which does not lead to the disorder. Where it does occur, there are very good services available.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to have psychological services everywhere the Army serves, but we do our best to recruit specialists in those fields. I do not have the exact figures, but will get them for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate how many of the 37 claims have been processed and in how many there was a settlement? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One case has been settled in court, one out of court and one withdrawn. There are, I believe, eight other cases where post-traumatic stress disorder was an ancillary injury to the claim, six of which have been settled. The bulk of the cases have still to be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>The number of officers who retired or resigned from the Permanent Defence Force in the past five years is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report. Commissioned officers may leave the Defence Forces by voluntary retirement or resignation of their commissions. As one might reasonably expect, members of the Permanent Defence Force across all ranks take up offers of civilian employment in times of economic prosperity. While this trend would also apply to some extent to certain other categories of public sector employees, there are two quite distinctive factors which specifically impinge upon the general PDF position.</P>
      <P>First, the PDF pension schemes are among the most generous within the public service. In the case of commissioned officers, a pension is payable immediately with a lump sum after the completion of only 12 years military service. For example, an officer such as an Army captain or commandant may retire from the PDF in his or her late thirties and immediately receive a military pension for life with a retirement lump sum. While exact amounts would, of course, vary by rank and service in individual cases, typical cases at commandant level could attract a pension of about £17,000 &ndash; 21,586 &ndash; per annum for life linked to future movements in commandants' pay, and a tax free gratuity of about £27,000 &ndash; 34,283.</P>
      <P>Second, it is widely recognised, not least by private sector employers, that the programmes of personal development and training available in the Defence Forces are second to none and can stand comparison with the best in the private sector. Nowadays, military skills training encompasses a very broad range of well recognised courses of training in highly marketable specialisms such as computer software and information technology. Many military personnel in all ranks are increasingly educated to diploma, degree and postgraduate degree level in such readily marketable specialisms. Obviously such personnel, already pre-trained and well experienced to the highest levels, are a tempting target to the private sector. In addition, the unique leadership and management skills of military officers have made them a very attractive target for managerial recruitment.</P>
      <P>The majority of officer retirements are currently voluntary in so far as they are not compulsorily determined by the reaching of a prescribed maximum retirement age by the incumbent. Relatively few officers stay in the PDF for the maximum period possible, that is, to their prescribed retirement age in rank, nor would this be desirable. The positive features of turnover within officer ranks and the consequential flow of promotions for younger officers must be actively borne in mind.</P>

      <i>Additional information.</i>The prestigious annual cadetship competition continues to draw an applicant pool of well educated and academically talented school leavers as clearly evidenced by the leaving certificate results of applicants for the 2001 competition. There were 732 individual applicants for the 2001 cadetship competition which resulted in a total of 64 successful applicants being awarded cadetships.</P>
    <P>To date in 2001, 13 successful candidates have already been appointed as direct entry officers to the Defence Forces comprising seven engineer officers, three medical officers, two watchkeeping officers and one marine engineer officer. Four aeronautical engineer officers are due to be appointed on 10 December next.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the appointment of engineer officers in the ordnance corps, electrical engineer officers in the Naval Service and medical and dental officers in the medical corps will be advertised shortly. The annual cadetship competition will be advertised early next year. The military authorities, which have responsibility for recruitment, advise that the development of a comprehensive cross-media recruitment advertising campaign to be launched in early 2002 is well advanced. This will strongly contribute to raising public awareness of the range of high quality careers in the Defence Forces, including the full range of officer careers.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the RACO conference in November, there is a need for the Defence Forces to retain highly trained and experienced captains and commandants. However, the attribution of the loss of young officers only to a relative lack of perceived personal challenge and rewards in their military careers presents a very distorted and partial element of a more complex picture.</P>
    <P>There are many other contributory factors. Two aspects that immediately come to mind are the lack of opportunity for rapid career advancement for the most talented and able young officers and, as I have already mentioned, the very attractive lump sum and pension arrange<Col N="808" /> ments available for departing officers. In recent years there have been great opportunities in the burgeoning private sector for such well qualified and highly motivated personnel.</P>
    <P>I stated at last year's RACO annual delegate conference and remain convinced that the Gleeson commission's recommendation that a mechanism be developed under which officers of exceptional ability might expect to reach the rank of lieutenant colonel while still in their 30s would help to reduce the loss to the private sector of at least some of the most experienced officers with skills that are in demand.</P>
    <P>While there have been a total of 137 officer promotions in 2001, a merit-based promotion scheme that will enable the best and brightest young officers to progress swiftly up the ranks is necessary, and it is my sincere hope RACO will work with the official side to devise a scheme that meets this objective. The planned review next year of the 1997 promotion agreement will provide an opportunity to address these issues.</P>
    <P>As set out in the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that an updated integrated Defence Forces personnel management plan was to be prepared by military management as a matter of priority. This plan is to set down policies and goals to ensure personnel policies and practices keep pace with the current best practice to the benefit of the Defence Forces. The proposed integrated personnel management plan will address the issues raised by the Deputy and establish a comprehensive intake policy and active personnel management framework to address the Defence Forces' officer requirements in the coming decade. I am conscious that the shortage of junior officers in the Defence Forces is causing some difficulties. This matter requires a creative, dynamic and innovative response. Among the initiatives which must be examined in this context are graduate recruitment, short service commissions and a much more active programme of commissioning from the ranks. I am sure these will be addressed in the integrated personnel management plan which the Chief of Staff is preparing for my consideration.</P>

    <P>Mr. Wall: I thank the Minister for his very detailed reply. A recent newspaper stated there was a 63% vacancy rate within Naval Service engineers. Does this endanger the services provided by the Navy in respect of fishery protection and smuggling, given the high number of detections of drugs by the Garda? Is the apparent inability to fill these positions in the Naval Ser<Col N="810" /> vice undermining the work of the Garda? Will the Minister examine the possibility of upgrading NCOs to fill these positions? The position in the Naval Service differs from that of the Army or Air Corps, given that the vacancy rate for Army engineers is 17% which seems out of sync with the 63% vacancy rate among Naval Service engineers.</P>

      <P>Regarding the cadet competition, there were 732 highly motivated and qualified applicants and 63 were recruited, which was the number required. In general, the number of people applying for existing posts under ongoing recruitment mechanisms is substantial. We will be in a position to fill the total number of posts we wished to fill this year. However, Deputy Wall is correct that there are difficulties with regard to some specialties. In 2001, some 13 successful candidates were appointed as direct entry officers to the Defence Forces. Seven engineer officers, three medical officers, two watchkeeper officers, one marine engineer officer and four aeronautical engineer officers are due to be appointed in December.</P>
      <P>The flag officer of the Naval Service and the military authorities in general are anxious to consider every option regarding the recruitment of specialty officers, including seeking such officers abroad. However, despite the reduced numbers, the flag officer reported that the Naval Service is managing very well. A major contribution in that regard was the acquisition of two new ships. The technology on those ships means the training and numbers required are lower than on the older fleet. Nevertheless, constant effort is necessary because competition from the private sector is intense with regard to the specialty areas. Some people with very good skills are lost and we would prefer to keep them. Ongoing efforts must be made to maintain the services at the highest level. However, there is no danger that any of the usual activities undertaken by the Naval Service are being jeopardised.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the private sector. Has any research or assessment been carried out on personnel who have taken early retirement or is it accepted that they have moved on to greener pastures in the private sector?</P>

      <P>As in every area, there is not only one factor. I mentioned the attractive pensions and other opportunities in the private sector for computer software engineers and experts in the technology area generally. There have been discussions about the possibility of devising a promotional scheme to ensure earlier promotion for young officers. We are working in consultation with the representative association to devise a programme under which earlier promotion opportunities might encourage some of the better and more skilled officers to stay.</P>

      <P>Yes. As the Deputy is aware, the pilots of the Gulfstream IV are very experienced, dedicated and committed. When they have any doubts, they are right not to fly the aircraft. The Gulfstream IV has undertaken 75 flights from 1 January to date. Although it was out of service while repair work was carried out, it has proved a valuable asset. It has also created considerable savings in terms of alternative flights. It is always available at crucial times and it provides plenty of privacy for discussions between Ministers and their officials on their way to do business in Europe and elsewhere. Despite the letdown in the instance mentioned by the Deputy, it has done an excellent job.</P>

How long has the Minister been aware that there are difficulties with the aircraft? Does he agree that such a failure could have a bad impact on morale? Is he satisfied that this incident will not recur and that the steps he has taken are enough to remedy the problem?</P>

      <P>The Gulfstream IV was in for an overhaul. Traditionally, these overhauls were done every two or three years but they now take place every year. It usually takes only a couple of weeks but there was corrosion on the tail of the aircraft which meant it was out of service longer. It is only half way through its lifespan. Most aircraft of that type fly for 20 years or more. I am satisfied the condition of the aircraft means one can have confidence in it. As I said, it has undertaken 75 trips already this year and more are planned.</P>

      <P>The roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by the Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in February 2000. Among the assigned roles is aiding the civil power, which means in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána which has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required in duties which include cash escorts.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have been requested by the Garda to provide assistance in securing cash in transit as part of the euro changeover. Such assistance has been rendered by the Defence Forces since 30 October and liaison between the Garda and the Defence Forces in this regard is continuing.

That £3 million is divided as follows: £2.25 million to the Defence Forces and £0.75 million to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the Garda activities. That amount does not include all of the costs associated with these transactions and needless to say it may well be time to see to what extent it can be increased.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish a speedy recovery to the member of the Defence Forces who was involved in this unfortunate incident. I have been informed by the Military authorities that he is recovering well from his injuries and I am sure the good wishes of the House go out to him and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the night of Tuesday last, 27 November 2001, a progression course from two to three star private ranking was under way in the Glen of Imaal. A number of personnel were instructed to fire blank ammunition during the course of the exercise. During the exercise a number of live rounds of ammunition were accidentally discharged. The injured private received bullet wounds to his arm and chest. A military ambulance was on site and the injured <Col N="815" /> party was immediately treated by a qualified emergency medical technician. The injured private was then transferred to Tallaght Hospital and subsequently to St. James's Hospital where he has undergone treatment and is in a stable condition.</P>
    <P>Military police were immediately called to the scene and are conducting a full investigation of the incident. I have been informed by the military authorities that a review of current procedures is being conducted urgently to determine what went wrong on this occasion. Pending the outcome, arrangements have been put in place to ensure that a recurrence of the events of 27 November does not take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael and on my behalf, I too extend best wishes to the injured party. While I appreciate that human error can come into play and that it is difficult to put in place a system whereby every eventuality can be covered, I find one aspect of such inquiries unusual. I am sure the Minister will not mind me referring to the last incident which, I think, occurred in Kilworth, where a 60 mm mortar went off. I do not know what were the findings of that inquiry. I know the weapon concerned was withdrawn from service for a period and perhaps it is still withdrawn from service, but it seems to be difficult to get an end result to the inquiry. Can the Minister give us any indication of when we will have a result of this inquiry? If he does not have the information, that is fair enough but perhaps he can update me on the current position in respect of the incident at Kilworth in December 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Timmins that sometimes these investigations, which are necessarily quite exhaustive because they must take everything into account, take a considerable time. I have asked on this occasion that the report of the military police and the subsequent court of inquiry, which will have to be held, be expedited as much as possible. However, I assure the Deputy that the safety procedures for military exercises is a matter of constant review for the military authorities. The Deputy will have some familiarity with it. Every effort is made to ensure that nothing like this takes place.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the incident I had a meeting with the Deputy Chief of Staff to express my concern that live bullets and blanks could be in such close proximity in these exercises, particularly at night. I am quite sure that changes will be made ultimately to ensure that nothing like that will ever take place again. I will give the details regarding the Kilworth matter to the Deputy as soon as I have them available to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 48 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The three questions have in common references to the European rapid reaction force. This term has common but misleading usage, which I regret has come to be misinterpreted as a reference to a prospective European army.</P>
      <P>This is not a European army. It is a means by which the European Union can establish a capability of carrying out humanitarian and peace support missions. National sovereignty is an underlying principle to participation in the European Security and Defence Policy. Ireland will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2), Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. The decisions on participation taken by individual member states will subsequently be confirmed through the framework of the EU Council.</P>
      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House agree that Ireland's reputation in international peacekeeping and conflict resolution has been, and continues to be, one of which the State can be proud. The Defence Forces in particular have represented Ireland for many years through participation in a wide range of United Nations missions throughout the world and have established a reputation well in excess of our proportionate size. In many areas of conflict, our military personnel have acquitted themselves well. Lebanon, the former Yugoslavia and East Timor are just some of the areas where Ireland has successfully brought to bear particular skills and experience in the promotion of peace.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an EU capacity to carry out humanitarian and crisis management missions, in support of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, called Petersberg Tasks, is a pragmatic and worthy progression of Ireland's role and reputation in the international arena of peacekeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> This process is based on provisions of the Treaty on European Union and have been elaborated in the conclusions of successive European Councils since Cologne in June 1999. In this regard, the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as the headline goal, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year.</P>
    <P>An appropriate arrangement for the financing of Petersberg Tasks is currently being discussed between the 15 member states. The prospective arrangements must take account of the voluntary nature of participation by each member state in EU actions and also take into account that an EU mission is likely to include civilian as well as military aspects.</P>
    <P>Based on these criteria, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have taken the view that an arrangement whereby each nation bears the costs of its own participation in any EU led action may provide the best solution. This is the basis on which Ireland has participated in both SFOR and KFOR in former Yugoslavia. However, I stress that these discussions are ongoing and are not likely to be concluded in the near future.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to the headline goal was made at a Capabilities Commitment Conference which was held at Brussels in November 2000. Our contribution consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System. This represents some 10% of our Army &ndash; not an inconsiderable undertaking by any standard. The largest element will consist of a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel. In addition, an Army Ranger Wing platoon of 40 personnel and small numbers of national support, headquarters and observer elements have been offered and will make up the remainder.</P>
    <P>In the 12 month period since the Capabilities Commitment Conference, planning work has been ongoing at EU level on developing the capabilities required to meet the headline goal by the target date of 2003. On 19 November 2001, I attended a Capabilities Improvement Conference &ndash; CIC &ndash; in Brussels, during which member states reviewed progress to date and agreed an action plan with the aim of addressing any identified capability shortfalls.</P>
    <P>At the conference, I reaffirmed Ireland's contribution of 850 personnel and outlined the progress which has been made with regard to the Governments commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are suitably prepared for future challenges which may arise in the context of participation in Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>The declaration issued by the CIC confirmed that the EU should be able to carry out the whole range of Petersberg Tasks by 2003, but it also <Col N="818" /> recognised that efforts must be made if the Union is to be able to carry out the most complex operations as efficiently as possible and to reduce any limitations and restrictions in terms of the breadth of the operation and the period of deployment as well as the level of risk.</P>
    <P>I emphasised that our fully professional Defence Forces can bring a great deal of expertise to bear in peace support operations as a consequence of the wide experience acquired in the humanitarian and crisis management area through participation in UN missions. In this way, we can make a valuable contribution to the headline goal and thus play a constructive role in promoting peace and stability in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed response. Will a contingent of Irish Defence Forces be involved and, if so, have they been identified? I know he has given a breakdown, but do Defence Forces personnel know they are included in the training for the Rapid Reaction Force? Will those involved be determined by voluntary means or by the Army allocating a number of sections, determined by the Minister as being part of Ireland's 850 strong contingent, to be sent on missions should they arise? Hopefully the need will not arise, although given current world affairs that cannot be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>Do the circumstances that arise or the country that needs assistance determine how many troops we send? Has there been any training to date or has it been mainly logistical work to prepare our group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, as the Deputy knows, this is taken on a case by case basis requiring Dáil approval and a UN mandate. Under the re-organisation of the Defence Forces, it is now a three brigade set-up. The ambition is to be able to draw from a particular brigade, moving on to a second and third as and when the opportunity arises if they are agreed. The advantage of that kind of linkage in training is obvious. Training and preparation is ongoing but it has been stepped up considerably, evidenced by fitness programmes, the use and acquisition of new technology and new and better equipment. In joining, the aspects of training, qualification and better equipment form part of what we want to be able to do.</P>
      <P>We already have terrific experience and we want to add to that, in a qualitative way, what we are able to do for the future if required. While the Deputy's question is primarily a military matter and one for those authorities, my understanding is that the traditional picture, which has been to draw from all the brigades to make up a battalion, will change. The aim now is to do that from individual brigades starting with the first and moving to the second and third and to ensure the training and resources for that group will enhance our ability to deliver. The training exercises in safety are also very important.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is reasonable to assume, on the setting up of such a force, that Irish personnel will be required to exercise abroad? I believe that legislation would be necessary for such an eventuality. Will the Minister confirm if that is the case and, if so, does he propose to bring forward legislation to enable Irish military personnel train abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons for joining the Partnership for Peace was to help in the training exercises and programmes that would lead to greater operability between different contingents. Deputy Timmins will know that on UN operations, each battalion operated on its own, to some extent, even though there was an adjoining territory where the Norwegians, British, Finns or French also operated. This is what we are trying to achieve here &ndash; to find out what Ireland can give in terms of top-ranking expertise, ability and equipment to complement contingents from another country so that the combination of what is being done in civilian as well as military areas is effective.</P>
      <P>I am not aware, and it has not been brought to my notice, that training exercises such as those carried out under the PfP would require the passing of legislation. What has been done to date is mainly preliminary work on developing necessary programmes. If legislation is necessary we will introduce it. I do not think that is likely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the reserve steering group. I established the special steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the reserve and the group reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have advised that the process of formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation <Col N="820" /> of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitúil with an army reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall army reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that members of the FCA should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to suitable qualifications, personal availability and appropriate advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions in other countries is common.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>General criteria governing selection for overseas service comes within the scope of representation and any matters relating to overseas service by members of the reserve which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. The question of the security of civilian employment for the members of the reserve who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level in brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces training centre, the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the integrated element of the reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established, it will form part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, the process will take about six years. I will be waiting anxiously to receive the implementation plan long before then. In the interim, I want to see the Styre rifles, the camouflage uniforms and an improvement in the accommodation. As there are too many units, amalgamation must take place. There are also many places where accommodation is grossly inadequate. As soon as I receive the implementation plan, I would like to have some of the interim work on accommodation and equipment started. I intend to move quickly on the 14 day training schedules, recruitment programmes for training camps and arrangements for night-time and weekend training for those unable to take part in 14 day training. I will move on the implementation plan as soon as possible on all the issues that can be decided on quickly. Although the full process will take longer, the FCA will begin to see the necessary work get a solid start which will benefit what is a difficult recruitment drive.</P>

I want it done right with as much consultation as possible. I am looking forward to creating opportunities for the overseas aspect of the new changes. If an opportunity arises within the next 12 months I hope suitably qualified persons who can afford the time and get the training will be given that opportunity. I am not aware of any legislative change that would be required, but we will examine the situation in order that we do not fall down on that aspect. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the progress made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the air accident investigation unit into the crash of an Air Corps helicopter in Tramore, County Waterford in July 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Following publication of the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999, urgent action was taken by my Department in relation to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. In this regard I put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The ninth meeting of a working group charged with overseeing the process took place on Thursday, 1 November 2001 in the Department of Defence, involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces and the flight safety officer of the Air Corps, as well as a representative from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Progress reports from the various bodies involved were presented and reviewed. I am pleased to say that very substantial progress is being made in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The group is scheduled to meet again on Thursday, 24 January 2002 and will continue to meet as necessary until all the safety recommendations set out in the report are implemented. It will be appreciated that safety of flying operations is an ongoing organic process requiring continuous attention.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations was that an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps should be commissioned. This was done and I received the final report of the consultants involved in July 2001. This report was examined by both my Department and the military authorities, following which the Air Corps was tasked to take immediate steps towards implementing the recommendations. In a report, submitted by the Air Corps flight safety officer last month, the Air Corps has outlined progress to date on implementing certain of the recommendations contained in the safety audit and the further action required. To further advance the implementation of the recommendations of the safety audit, a working group was established comprising members of the Defence Forces and an official of my Department, to oversee the consideration and implementation of the safety issues addressed in the safety audit. The working group met most recently last Thursday, 29 November 2001 and, again, I am pleased to announce that significant progress is being made.</P>
      <P>A further key recommendation contained in the air accident investigation unit report was the establishment of an air safety office in the Air Corps and this was acted on straightaway. The air safety office is an intrinsic part of the new Air Corps organisational structure. A full-time flight safety officer of lieutenant colonel rank and an officer of captain rank have been appointed by the GOC Air Corps to the office. The flight safety officer reports directly to the GOC Air Corps. The flight safety officer has availed of a programme of specialist training and courses to equip him for his post. The findings of the independent air operations safety audit are the primary focus of the flight safety office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> As I have previously stated in the House, I take all safety issues very seriously and the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, at home and overseas, is of paramount importance. I have emphasised to the military authorities that safety standards in equipment, facilities and procedures are of the utmost importance. Funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment and procedures where necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the recommendations procedural or has there been physical change in relation to flight safety and the flight safety office? If there has been actual physical change, what was the cost to the Department? Has there been an increase in the number of officials attached to the flight safety office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been changed to colonel and captain rank. We have had a series of meetings involving officials of my Department and the Air Corps and, in certain circumstances, the Department for the Marine and Natural Resources. The changes are primarily procedural, though there have been some physical changes. I am satisfied that a large number of the recommendations have already been implemented. The issue needs constant review. I have no idea of what the overall cost might be, but whatever it is and wherever it is needed, funding will be made available.</P>

      <P>The new Civil Defence Bill has been included in the list of priority legislation to be published during the current Dáil session. Detailed consultations with stakeholders have taken place and drafting is almost completed. I expect that the Bill will be enacted early in the new year. As the Deputy may be aware, following the recent events in the United States and the wider threat from global terrorism and arising from a review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted here, the Government recently established the office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>While it is not envisaged at this stage that the existing response arrangements for Civil Defence will alter considerably as a result of these developments, the organisation will nonetheless remain ready and willing to respond to any requests for assistance that may emerge from the ongoing review of emergency planning. This will involve a continuing review of the training and equipment requirements of the organisation as a support to the front line emergency services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>We regularly see members of Civil Defence involved in traffic control and similar activities, which is not what it was established to do. Is the Minister satisfied with the role that Civil Defence plays? What effort is made to generate interest in it from an educational point of view and among the general public? Do Civil Defence personnel visit schools to engender an interest in it and encourage more people to be <Col N="825" /> involved so that the organisation will not be seen simply as providing stewards at race meetings and public meetings? People should appreciate that it is a vital part of national defence and have more respect for Civil Defence, whose members are committed to what they do but have no chance to develop it.</P>

This is my first opportunity to congratulate Civil Defence on its magnificent work in dealing with the foot and mouth disease crisis this year, where its members were truly in the front line and played a large part in minimising risk. I thank each and every member.</P>
      <P>Civil Defence does a range of unglamorous duties such as search and rescue, stewarding at events, supporting the Garda and flood relief. I agree that we must do more about recruitment which is one reason for introducing the Civil Defence Bill in the next session. A clause in it will require the board to engage in marketing and recruitment and to strengthen the corporate image of Civil Defence, which is what the Deputy seeks.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that Civil Defence was grossly underfunded by successive Governments over many years and did not receive the recognition and assistance it needed? What input did he have to move its headquarters to Roscrea from Dublin? Is it a positive sign that onlyColour RGB 170,0,0 one member of the 30 staff remained after the move? One of the central roles of headquarters is to conduct training weekends. Previously, a young person from Sligo, for instance, could travel by train to Dublin, but how is such a person without a car to get to Roscrea, in north Tipperary?

      <P>In recent weeks there has been ample evidence of the Government searching around for some good news. However, turning the defeat on the Sellafield issue into some kind of victory was a bridge beyond which it had not previously gone. I put it to the Taoiseach that after four and a half years of Government the campaign to shut Sellafield has been an abject failure because it is actually expanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> Is the Taoiseach aware that a month after British Nuclear Fuels invited the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to visit Sellafield to inspect its safety facilities, no such visit has been arranged? Did the Taoiseach raise this with the British Prime Minister when they discussed Sellafield last week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the disappointment of the Labour Party with the tribunal in Hamburg, the Taoiseach can take some comfort, however small, in the fact that for the first time the Irish Government has been accorded the right under international law to information and to a shared responsibility with the British authorities for ensuring the Irish Sea must not be polluted by the Sellafield operation. Will he outline the steps the Government now intends to take to build on the rather narrow but nevertheless positive platform that has come out of the deliberations of this tribunal? What action will he take to ensure we get the full information regarding the safety of the operation of the plant, the environmental impact of the MOX regeneration plant and the overall operation of Sellafield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government appreciates the efforts of the Attorney General and his legal team who have worked so hard on this in recent months. The tribunal may not have done everything we wanted. It is disappointing not to have received a full injunction from the tribunal, but we are still at an early stage of the process. Yesterday, the tribunal accepted Ireland has rights under the UN Law of the Sea Convention and these rights must be protected. That was a very important victory. It rejected both arguments of the high level United Kingdom legal team, which was backed by enormous resources. These were that no provision or measures should be ordered and that Ireland should pay the UK's costs.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's judgment is complicated and our legal advisers are considering their next steps. Under the judgment, we have two weeks to come to an arrangement with the United Kingdom, which would satisfy our rights under the convention and will satisfy the conditions laid down by the tribunal yesterday. If agreement cannot be reached within that time, we will return to the tribunal to take further steps, which we will work out with our legal team.</P>
      <P>I call on the United Kingdom to delay commissioning until the parties have reached agreement on measures to prevent pollution from the MOX plant in accordance with the tribunal's order. I expect the United Kingdom to do that.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, we continue to prosecute our case, both under the Law of the Sea and the OSPAR Convention. We are also prepared to take steps under EU law as appropriate. We will continue with the various measures and instruments available to us.</P>

      <P>Everybody in this house and in the country has watched with mounting horror, the carnage and violence that has visited the Holy Land in recent weeks. There have been suicide bombers in Jerusalem killing innocent young people out enjoying themselves and then retaliation by helicopter gunships shooting, apparently indiscriminately, in different parts of Palestine. Against that background and the realisation that we on this island know violence is not an appropriate means to the pursuit of political solutions &ndash; quite the contrary, it creates obstacles that take years to dismantle &ndash; will the Taoiseach outline what action Ireland has taken at the UN Security Council to date to try to bring a resolution to this conflict? What action does he propose to take with the European Union leaders next week in Laeken? Can he give his assurance that Ireland will bring its full authority to bear on its European partners and on the UN Security Council to ensure the Palestinian Authority, <Col N="831" /> which is the only hope for peace on the Palestinian side is not systematically undermined or destroyed by the outrageous activities of the Prime Minister, Mr. Sharon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is a European Union position on the conflict between Israel and Palestine. What input has the Government had to that policy? Is there a proposal in the Department of Foreign Affairs to alter our position in view of the outrageous events which have occurred in the past 48 hours? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply concerned, as I am sure is everyone in the House and in the country, at the latest developments in the Middle East. The Minister for Foreign Affairs sent a letter to Shimon Peres expressing the Government's horror at the appalling attacks against Israeli civilians at the weekend. He utterly condemned those attacks. He also extended sympathy to all those who suffered in the atrocities.</P>
      <P>The Government associates itself fully with what was communicated in the statement issued by the President of the European Union condemning the attacks and calling on the Palestinian authority to do everything in its power to bring the perpetrators to justice. That was quickly followed yesterday when we learned with equal horror and grave concern about the Israeli retaliatory raids on the Palestinian targets. We have stressed the urgent need for the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to quickly renew security co-operation. We support the EU call on the Israelis and Palestinians to end the cycle of violence and to restart the peace process regardless of how difficult it is. As Deputy Quinn said, we know that progress will not be made if the process stops every time there is an atrocity. It is the wrong thing to do.</P>
      <P>Our delegation in New York has already been in consultation in recent days with a number of leading Arab delegations to ascertain their views about raising this issue at the United Nations Security Council. I checked this morning and the procedure is that the issues relating to Palestine are raised in the Security Council by one of the member states from the non-aligned movement at the behest of the Arab group of countries. Discussions about precisely what will happen are still ongoing. The position is that the Arab countries have not yet met to discuss how they will deal with this as a group. They have not yet been asked to do so by the Palestinian observer. They are waiting for the Palestinian observer to ask them. The Department of Foreign Affairs and our ambassador are ready to play any possible constructive role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the EU resolution have been set out and I am sure the parties have already seen them. We will keep closely in touch. These are terrible atrocities and horrific acts by both sides. They will not help anyone as it is innocent civilians who will suffer and are already suffering. I <Col N="832" /> know evil people have been involved in the terrible organisation of the atrocities in recent days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in rejecting out of hand the assertion made by Prime Minister Sharon that Yasser Arafat was in some way personally responsible for supporting terrorism, that the Palestinian authority was in some way responsible for or giving support to terrorism and that, therefore, Israel or the present national coalition Government in Israel cannot hide behind the declarations condemning terrorism that emanated from the United Nations after the attacks on 11 September? Does he also recognise that the European Union is the major contributor to the meagre financial resources of the Palestinian authority? Will he make provision in Ireland's aid programme for additional funds to repair the damage done by the Israeli defence forces to residential and other community property in the areas occupied by the Israeli forces and in the Palestinian authority areas over which it has a limited degree of control? Will he give an undertaking that in advance of Laaken he will ensure this matter is firmly on the agenda for comprehensive discussion by the European Union leaders on 13 and 14 December and that pressure is brought to bear on the Palestinians and particularly on the Israelis, having regard not just to the internal issues of justice for the peoples on both sides concerned but to the international implications and stability of the Middle East upon which Europe is critically dependent? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the discussions next week, while I have not had any indication about it, I am sure that will be the case. We will strongly support that. I will meet Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt in the next number of days. The EU's position will remain as it is. Its statement today strongly supports maintaining the diplomatic efforts to relaunch the political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, a number of times. I <Col N="833" /> do not believe he is doing anything other than trying to find ways to move forward. He has a difficult situation with which to deal. He does not control Hamas and the other terror groups. Last year when President Clinton had almost reached a successful round of discussions following the Camp David and other initiatives during 1999 and 2000, he analysed he was not in a position to deal with that. That still remains the position. He and his colleagues are not doing anything other than trying to find a way forward.</P>
    <P>I am sure I speak for everyone in the House when I say that, while accepting that extremism and terrorism can destroy the current diplomatic efforts, we must try to ensure the international community continues its efforts to move on the peace process in spite of the difficulties. George Mitchell, whom we all know has made efforts, said in his statement last night that President Arafat is still the best opportunity for reaching the desired situation. Having visited the area, seen the 1949 camps, listened to numerous discussions in recent years and read many statements and reports of meetings, there will not be any hope of making progress in the foreseeable generation if President Arafat is not there.</P>

      <P>The Justice and Home Affairs Council will meet this week. A large number of measures have been passed by Cabinet which are on the agenda for that depending on progress in the Justice and Home Affairs Council. It is not because of us but because of the pace of debate in the Council generally that I have not moved on these items quickly. A large number of items are on the agenda for 7 December, as was originally envisaged. As soon as that meeting is over, we will know what other matters we will have to deal with.</P>

      <P>I have done this before. Until the matters are cleared at the Justice and Home Affairs Council, we perhaps will not proceed with them. The legislation is the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill, which is before the Dáil, the suppression of the financing of terrorism Bill, to allow for the ratification of the UN convention on the suppression of the financing of terrorism, the suppression of terrorist bombings Bill to allow for the ratification of the UN convention on the suppression of terrorist bombings, the convention against the taking of hostages Bill to allow for the ratification of the UN convention against the taking of hostages, and the prevention and punishment of attacks on internationally protected persons Bill to allow for the ratification of the UN convention on the prevention and punishment of attacks on internationally protected persons.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to do so, and I understand that under Standing Orders I have a right to make an explanatory statement. I am moving this motion because Members of this House who have not had a chance to debate the Bill, because it was referred to a committee of the House, should understand the importance of this amendment to the Constitution. It is unique and unprecedented in that what is being proposed by the Government is, in effect, to put legislation in the Constitution. It is being done in a way that is legally and constitutionally suspect, and it is being done with an approach that is impossible to understand. The Taoiseach made it clear that it is unlikely that the referendum will be held prior to February, yet the Government is determined to steam-roll this legislation through the House. I do not know if it is to make sure that the Bill is completed before the bishops meet in the next ten days to two weeks, but something is putting tremendous pressure on the Government to make it insist on guillotining the Bill on Second Stage, even though not all Members of the House had an opportunity to speak on it.</P>
      <P>When Committee Stage was taken by the Committee on Health and Children a guillotine was again imposed by the Government, even though less than half the amendments tabled had been debated. A raft of amendments was not discussed in any shape or form on Committee Stage. Now a further guillotine is being imposed on Report Stage, the only opportunity Members have to debate a very important amendment to the Constitution. The Government has adopted an extraordinary and unnecessary position. There is no good reason for its approach.</P>
      <P>We need to be aware &ndash; A Cheann Comhairle this will interest you &ndash; that there is a real and pressing danger that what we are doing may damage the Constitution. We should also be concerned that the issue the amendment deals with relates to a matter of life or death for Irish women. In effect, what it proposes to do is remove the right to life which Irish women currently enjoy under the Constitution. We are, therefore, addressing a deeply important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach also flies in the face of the recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution which recently produced a report on how referendums should be managed <Col N="857" /> and processed both in terms of this House and of informing the public. We all know the last referendum was, as described in the research attendant to the report, an unhappy experience for Irish people. People were not fully informed and went to the polls in a very confused state. This was shown by all the research related to the Nice treaty referendum.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee on the Constitution recommended there should be a change in Standing Orders. With regard to drawing up legislation to propose an amendment to the Constitution, the report proposes to amend the Standing Orders of each House to embody a presumption that every TD and Senator will have sufficient opportunity to make whatever contribution he or she wishes to make. The consensus of the committee, which met under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Brian Lenihan, was that this process is particularly important when a constitutional amendment is being dealt with and that a referendum is something exceptional.</P>
    <P>A referendum is not ordinary legislation because it deals with matters of life and death. It is most extraordinary that the Government is trying to incorporate the amendment into the Constitution to ensure that, no matter how flawed it might be, it can only be changed by a vote of the people. We will lose our right as legislators to exercise influence or deal with these flaws.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister who is objecting to a recommital of the Bill which would ensure all amendments are dealt with and all Members of the House can speak. I was impressed that so many members of the Opposition spoke forcefully and eloquently about the deficiencies of this Bill on Committee Stage, even though the meeting took place in the bowels of this building. The same cannot be said of the Government. The silence of the vast majority of Fianna Fáil Deputies and all the Progressive Democrats' Deputies was notable.</P>
    <P>We have to ensure that a Bill of this type is fully scrutinised in this House so that when it is put to the people no one can argue that due process was not carried through. We clearly have a problem. Rather than allowing due parliamentary process, the Government is mindlessly and ruthlessly driving this through the House as if the devils in hell were pursuing it. What is the urgency? Surely amendments to change the Constitution should be subject to full scrutiny to ensure it is good, sound legislation.</P>
    <P>If we can no longer feel secure that we can do the work for which we are paid, there is a serious threat to the way in which the Constitution is protected, the way this House deals with legislation <Col N="858" /> and, most particularly, the way in which the lives of women are protected. This is the reason I tabled the motion, not to delay, but to take the correct approach to ensure we have prepared the ground, in line with recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution, for whatever referendum proposal emerges at the end of the process.</P>

    <P>I apologise for not being here when I was called. It was not taken in this order the last day.

It is set out on page 7 of the Bill and deals with a section beginning with the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo;. Different emphases have been put on these words by different people and the Minister has given the House to understand that they do not have any great importance. It seems that they have greater importance than he suggests because this will be inserted as Article 40.3.4º and preceding it will be the statement that the right to life of the unborn is to be vindicated and defended &ndash; not just protected.</P>
    <P>This general statement followed by the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; implies that Article 40.3.4º will be subject to Article 40.3.3º. However, an alternative reading could be that this is not the case at all. Looking at the words, &ldquo;In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002&rdquo;, it can be seen that it is much weaker than what is contained in Article 40.3.3º which states that the right to life of the unborn in the womb, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, shall be defended and vindicated. It states, &ldquo;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment seems to be, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, a reduction in the protection for the unborn. As Article 40.3.3º is drafted, there seems to be a fine balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn, but whereas much emphasis has been put on the implications of the X case for the mother, we have not put enough emphasis during the debate on the implications of the amendment for the unborn. We need to draw this out and be specific and clear about it. Anybody reading or listening to this debate should know the implications before they cast their vote if the Bill is passed and the question is put to the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes said on Committee Stage that he thought all this could be done with legislation. I disagreed, thinking that this section could contravene Article 40.3.3º and ought to be dealt with by a constitutional amendment in order that any legislation could not be judged to be in contravention of Article 40.3.3º. Since then, however, I have spoken to senior counsel and it seems that Deputy Dukes may have been correct. A case could be made for doing this with ordinary legislation, although I do not know whether it would stand up to a challenge.</P>
    <P>The Minister could not do what he wanted to do in the Second Schedule, that is, to define abortion as a crime &ndash; after implantation in the womb of the mother &ndash; without this reduction in protection for the unborn. I wonder why he did not use the same words as are used in Article 40.3.3º. <Col N="862" /> Why, in this case, is it a question of the unborn in the womb only being protected, as against being vindicated and defended, as far as practicable, by law? If this was introduced simply as a law, would we be capable of doing this? The Minister has not answered this question to my satisfaction. I ask him to go into it in some detail. Is he reducing protection for the unborn?</P>
    <P>The Minister has been talking about the harmonious interpretation of the Constitution, that doctrine which is followed by the High Court and the Supreme Court. If Article 40.3.4º were passed, a future High Court or Supreme Court considering a challenge would take into account all the provisions of the Bill. It seems that, for example, under Article 40.3.3º, notwithstanding the passing of this, it might still be possible for a future Government to bring forward legislation to ban the morning-after pill on the basis that it is an abortifacient, even though the Minister said during his contribution that it was a contraceptive. On the other hand, a future Supreme Court, using this doctrine of harmonious interpretation in a challenge concerning, for example, stem cell research or research on the embryo could interpret Article 40.3.4º as permitting this sort of research which has been giving rise to much concern and to report on which the Minister has quite rightly established an expert group.</P>
    <P>We need to be clear on this. I would like the Minister to revisit the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; and tell us precisely the reason that formula is being used. Those words have been included deliberately and by design. He should also explain to us about the protection of the unborn in the womb. Would this more specific expression of Article 40.3.3º in fact reduce protection for the unborn?</P>
    <P>The Bill is entitled the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. However, the First Schedule deals with the name of the Bill to be put before the House following approval by the people, that is, the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill, 2002. Since it is and has been clear all along that this will be a 2002 Bill, I do not understand the reason we have been in such a mad rush to get it through the House and the reason the Fine Gael proposal for time to consider it was not agreed. Even taking two or three months we could still have put the question to the people in the spring which I understand is the intention.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not answer this question when I raised it on Committee Stage so I will ask it now. It is a simple question. In terms of the criminal offence provisions in this Bill, when does the clock of life begin to run? I believe human life begins at conception. I have no difficulty in saying that. As one of my colleagues said to me recently, even an atheist scientist would probably confirm that. It is nothing to do with religious belief although most Members would be influenced by that. The criminal offence of abortion being provided for in 1(1) of the Schedule is not the same as that which exists in the Offences Against the <Col N="863" /> Person Act, 1861, which talks about procuring a miscarriage. I ask the Minister to address the question of this case and tell us when the clock of life begins. When does the offence start? Implantation is not defined in the definition section of the Bill so when is it an offence and what evidence would be required to show implantation had taken place?</P>
    <P>This Schedule gives rise to pro-life concerns but I do not wish to go over the top about them. My job as counsel for the prosecution, so to speak, is to test the weaknesses in the Bill. I note that many of the contributions have centred on the X case and in particular on the concerns of the mother and that is quite right. I am equally concerned. Article 40.3.3º does hone the balance there but it would be wrong to proceed with this debate and to look at all the arguments for and against this amendment without equally testing the Minister's case for the effect this legislation and amendment would have on the rights of the unborn. We are entitled to know this clearly.</P>
    <P>I would prefer that the Minister spell this out and that it not be left to some referendum commission to put the case for and against, as thought up by lawyers. The Minister has put the Bill together with the advice of a number of people so he is in a good position to advise the House on these matters. It is something we will require detailed answers for if the Bill is passed and put to the people. It is in everybody's interest that the Minister clearly indicate in reply to my questions his response to the issues I have raised.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said he would come back to me on the latter part of the First Schedule where it deals with the law containing only the provisions set out in the Second Schedule's Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Act, 2001. If it is carried &ldquo;this section, other than the amendment of Article 40 of this Constitution effected thereby, shall be omitted from every official text of this Constitution published thereafter&rdquo;. As a matter of interest and technicality, will the Minister confirm that a full text of the Constitution with all amendments is available to Members and the public? Is a copy kept in the Attorney General's office or the Chief Parliamentary Counsel's office? The Minister should explain that to us so that we are informed. Whereas the wording that will be passed will be seen by us now it will not appear in future drafts of the Constitution. I understand why it would not because with all the amendments made through the years the Constitution would be unreadable but is there a kind of master version of the Constitution, with all the amendments intact, kept some place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be grateful to Deputy Mitchell for putting forward this amendment because it is a matter of concern which Deputies felt was not fully addressed when raised on Committee Stage. The relationship between Article <Col N="864" /> 40.3.3º and the proposed Article 40.3.4º is an issue at the heart of which is the fact that there is possible conflict between the two. It is ambiguous because we have an article of the Constitution being retained and a new section being proposed which is different in certain respects even though it relates to the same issue &ndash; the right to life of the unborn. That difference between the two could give rise to litigation and difficulties of interpretation if this proposal is incorporated in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>If anything, the wording in the Bill highlights and is a signpost to this difficulty because the Minister himself refers to it by starting Article 40.3.4º with the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo;. It says &ldquo;In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002.&rdquo; Those words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; are defining that this section of the Constitution, if it is added to the Constitution by the people, is different to Article 40.3.3º in some way. It seems obvious that is correct particularly if that wording is included. If the words were &ldquo;notwithstanding the existing Article&rdquo; it would be more logical and comprehensible.</P>
      <P>I can understand why the Government does not propose to remove Article 40.3.3º as there would be political difficulties with that. It would open quite a can of worms in terms of controversy. We have an article in the Constitution which states clearly the right to life of the unborn and of the mother and that has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include where there is a risk to suicide. What the Minister is now proposing is the addition of Article 40.3.4º which says something else. It says &ldquo;In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us take the issue of the unborn first. It was dealt with by Deputy Mitchell but it is worth repeating. There is no definition in Article 40.3.3º that says it is only the unborn in the womb that is protected. When we look at the actual provisions of the Bill itself we see a further restriction on the definition because it refers to abortion as meaning &ldquo;the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation&rdquo;. So we have a series of qualifications being presented. At the same time, the original article, which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court, stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the issue in relation to the right to life of the mother it is clear in Article 40.3.3º, which is already part of the Constitution, that &ldquo;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&rdquo; Mothers have a protection and right to life at the moment and that has been interpreted to include where there is a risk of suicide on which the Supreme Court was asked to make a judgment because of the <Col N="865" /> tragic X case, where a young girl was suicidal and prevented from having an abortion. The Supreme Court made it clear that its interpretation included a risk of suicide. Mr. Justice O'Flaherty stated clearly that, in his view, the law protected women and that that was the current position on the risk of suicide.</P>
    <P>This proposal deliberately removes that protection. There is no ambiguity in the Bill. Those who drafted it are not hiding what they do, but state in the Second Schedule that abortion does not include the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which, or as a result of which, unborn human life is ended, where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction. The words &ldquo;other than by self-destruction&rdquo; form the kernel of the Bill and require a referendum. This indicates to me &ndash; I am reasonably intelligent, although I have no legal training &ndash; that there is a conflict between what is being proposed in Article 40.3.4º and what is already provided for in the Constitution in Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    <P>I received legal advice which stated:</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; at the start of Article 40.3.4º are particularly difficult to interpret. Do they mean that the unborn can continue to have protection beyond that offered in the Act, or do they limit the protection of the unborn to that offered in the Act? These words imply that Article 40.3.4º may be incompatible with the existing Article 40.3.3º. In relation to Article 40.3.4º, it may also be incompatible with Article 40.3.3º for the reason that it makes no reference to the equal right to life of the mother, nor is any reference made in the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, to the right to life of the mother. Yet Article 40.3.3º clearly provides that the State must have due regard to the mother's life. Limiting the right to life of the mother by ruling out suicide as a ground on which her right to life may take priority over that of the unborn appears fundamentally incompatible with the protection for her right to life under Article 40.3.3º. It is thus very likely that, even if passed, Article 40.3.4º will give rise to significant litigation issues as it is difficult to see how this inconsistency between Article 40.3.3º and Article 40.3.4º can be overcome given the wording of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002.</P>
    <P>In 1992 Deputy O'Malley said it was unnecessary to remove from the Constitution the risk of suicide as being a risk to a woman's life when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, proposed it. He gave the example of an anorexic girl who was brutally raped and pregnant but could not travel and was suicidal as a result of her experience. He stated even though it was exceptional, unusual and rare, such a case could arise. Everyone <Col N="866" /> thought the X case was extraordinary, and when in 1983 many of us argued against putting this matter in the Constitution, those on the other side of the argument argued that such exceptional cases would not arise. We know now that not only was there the X case, but the C case also.</P>
    <P>If the case of the anorexic girl, described by Deputy O'Malley, was argued in court as her having protection for her own right to life under Article 40.3.3º, which will still be in the Constitution after this referendum, would her right to life be protected as it must be under that article, or would it be denied under Article 40.3.4º? We must foresee this. There is a certain validity in the Government's stating the courts have been left to interpret these matters, but this is hard to accept when there is this essential ambiguity to be decided upon by them. The Minister may say that these two sections will be read in harmony. We all want harmony, and would all like to see harmony on this issue, but that would be too ambitious. We cannot simply answer this question by saying that the two must be read in harmony because they are not in harmony. That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>There may be a new argument presented which was not made on Committee Stage, but one cannot read something which is contradictory in a way that will undo this. Words on a page are words on a page. One cannot make them into something else by any drafting sleight of hand. A lack of logic will remain no matter how they are read. This is not a sufficient answer to explain how one part of the Constitution would provide for the right to life of the unborn while another would provide for the qualified right to life of the unborn, so long as it is in the womb after plantation. Article 40.3.3º would provide for the right to life of the mother, but there would be no such right in Article 40.3.4º because it would exclude the risk of suicide. The people were asked this question in 1992 and did not remove the risk of suicide in respect of the right to life. If the question is put to them again, I suspect because of how society has moved on, the answer is even less likely to be to remove a woman's right to life.</P>

      <P>This issue was debated at considerable length on Committee Stage when I gave clear answers. A clear statement was given on the use of the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; and other issues to which Deputies Gay Mitchell and McManus referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the Deputies did not accept the answers or the arguments. There is a difference between getting answers and agreeing with them. In a democracy people are entitled to different perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I restate that the term &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; when used in the proposed Article 40.3.4º makes it clear that the statute envisaged by the amend<Col N="867" /> ment is not intended to be a restatement of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; as used in Article 40.3.3º. As I explained on Committee Stage, when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court must follow the well established principle of harmonious interpretation. In other words, constitutional provisions should not be construed in isolation from all other parts of the Constitution, among which they are embedded, but should be so construed as to harmonise with other parts of the Constitution. Therefore, neither of these articles can be regarded as taking precedence over the other; they must be construed together. Deputy McManus has tabled amendment No. 4 and Deputy Mitchell amendment No. 5 on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell drew attention to the use of language in Article 40.3.4º as opposed to the language used in Article 40.3.3º. I strongly reject the questions raised by him that the use of the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; in any way weakens the protection of the unborn. It does not. We did not set out in this proposal to define when human life begins. We are defining the act or crime of abortion. We are providing a modern statute in terms of the crime of abortion. We are referring to the intentional destruction of the baby after implantation in the womb. We made this very clear on Committee Stage. We went through all the details and defined implantation in terms of the process involved. It was teased out in some detail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made an erroneous deduction as to the reason the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; was inserted and we did not use the word &ldquo;defend&rdquo;, which is already included in Article 40.3.3º. As Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º will be read together, there is no necessity to insert those words into Article 40.3.4.º However, the deduction he made that we would be restrained in what we could do in the legislation unless we used this particular form of language in the article itself is not correct. That was certainly not the purpose of the subsequent language used in the legislation. The Bill does not reduce the protection of the unborn.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Mitchell's point made on Committee Stage that not much emphasis was placed on the dimension of the unborn in the debate. I said that myself towards the end of Committee Stage, but that is a function of those who contributed to the debate. Deputy John Bruton came in at one stage and raised it.</P>

      <P>I accept that, but I took that view. Other organisations are trying to make that assertion, but it is totally untrue. Several months ago we established a commission on assisted human reproduction to look into all the aspects of what is a rapidly developing area, particularly in relation to embryo research, and to consider the ethics involved, etc. We drew together people with particular expertise in the field. It is a very complex area, which is not covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is no conflict between Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º. The constitutional legal advice is very strong in terms of harmonious interpretation by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell also raised a question about the form of the Constitution after the referendum. He asked whether there would be any form of the Constitution, in which all the amendments proposed in the Bill will continue to appear even after the passage of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill. There is provision in the Constitution for this. The text of the Bill, when enacted, will be enrolled in the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 25.4.5º of the Constitution which states:</P>
      <P>As soon as may be after the signature and promulgation of a Bill as a law, the text of such law which was signed by the President or, where the President has signed the text of such law in each of the official languages, both the signed texts shall be enrolled for record in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and the text, or both the texts, so enrolled shall be conclusive evidence of the provisions of such law.</P>
      <P>In relation to the text of the Constitution, Article 25.5 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be lawful for the Taoiseach, from time to time as occasion appears to him to require, to cause to be prepared under his supervision a text (in both the official languages) of this Constitution as then in force <Col N="869" /> embodying all amendments theretofore made therein.</P>
    <P>A copy of every text so prepared, when authenticated by the signatures of the Taoiseach and the Chief Justice, shall be signed by the President and shall be enrolled for record in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The copy so signed and enrolled which is for the time being the latest text so prepared shall, upon such enrolment, be conclusive evidence of this Constitution as at the date of such enrolment and shall for that purpose supersede all texts of this Constitution of which copies were previously so enrolled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can do this in two minutes, but I understand I can come back in any event. Articles 40 to 44, which will be amended yet again if these proposals go through, deal with personal rights under the overall heading &ldquo;Fundamental Rights.&rdquo; Article 41 states: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo; It goes on to state: &ldquo;This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Interestingly enough, the Bill defines a woman as a &ldquo;female person.&rdquo; I presume a man means a &ldquo;male person.&rdquo; Since all citizens as human persons shall be held equal before the law and we have a definition for a woman and <i>de facto</i> for a man, why do we not have a definition for the unborn? There is no definition in Article 40.3.3º. There is no mention of conception. There is no definition for implantation. There certainly is no definition for the unborn.</P>
      <P>Under these fundamental rights, where we speak about human persons, I presume the Minister would agree that the Constitution, in Article 40.3.3º in particular, sees the unborn as a human person, which has certain rights. If that is the case, why is there no definition in the Bill for the unborn? There is a definition for a woman to which I will come back.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims he has answered all the questions. This is the fourth time I have asked him when the clock of life starts in relation to the offence of abortion and he has not answered me directly. I can understand he may have difficulty in doing so, but the wording as proposed does change the definition of the crime of abortion from that contained in the 1861 Act, which is to procure a miscarriage. The Minister should tell us more clearly his thinking in changing that definition.</P>

      <P>I revert to the individual case to which I was referring in order to get clarity. I would not ask the Minister to take on the role of <Col N="870" /> the Supreme Court. If a child went to court, could that person argue under Article 40.3.3º that they had a right to life, including a right to life where there is a risk of suicide since that is included in the Constitution, or would that person be prevented from doing so on the basis that Article 40.3.4º states something different? Is it the case that one does not lose the right already enshrined in Article 40.3.3º since it is established and interpreted by the Supreme Court, although a subsection of another article in the Constitution states something else? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting to the core of the issue which confronts us. We are talking about the definition and the need to be utterly transparent with the people. We are proposing to put before the people a proposal to change the Constitution. It is essential that the people fully understand the import and the impact of that change.</P>
      <P>I sat through the all-party committee hearings for approximately six weeks and it was instructive to hear the different views. It taught me about the enormous complexity of the issue with which we were dealing. There is an old saying that where there is a complex problem, one can provide a simple solution. However, that does not work. If there is a complex problem, one must be clear that there is not a simple answer to it. If an issue is put before the people, they are in a position of being judge and jury. If a case is before the courts and a jury, it is important that there is a full explanation of the issues to allow the jury to come to a decision in the full knowledge of all those issues.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the present proposal because the people do not understand what the Minister is trying to do. The people are not engaged in the debate and they do not fully understand the proposal. That is the worst possible way to present it to the people for their decision. There are many reasons they do not fully understand it. Part of the reason for the lack of engagement is that they do not fully understand the issue. I do not decry the Minister's efforts, but they have not worked. Part of the problem is the lack of a definition, as Deputy Gay Mitchell said. There are different definitions for the same issue, even for the term &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;. We found out during the committee hearings that the word abortion was defined differently from the medical point of view &ndash; different medics had different definitions &ndash; and from the legal point of view. There was not a legal definition of abortion, although people relied on the 1861 Act in the past. The committee heard theological evidence, but again there were different views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty now is that there is further confusion about abortion because of the different treatment of the unborn, which is also undefined, from conception to implantation and thereafter. It is difficult, if not impossible, for many people who were brought up believing that the moment of life began at conception to accept that there <Col N="871" /> should be a difference in the treatment of this issue before and after implantation. My understanding, although I am not a medical expert, is that there is a period of 14 days on average between conception and implantation. I think I understand what the Minister is trying to do, but the public does not. Many people will not accept that there should be a distinction or the Minister's reason for that distinction. That is one of the principal issues which will cause the Minister difficulty in having this proposal accepted by the people.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the spectrum there is the difficulty in terms of the threat of self-destruction. That issue has not been fully clarified for the people. I accept that before the committee hearings the evidence we had was that pregnancy reduced the possibility of suicide. On the other hand, the evidence before the committee was that it was rare even when a therapeutic intervention was carried out for physical reasons. The evidence from the masters of the three maternity hospitals was that it only occurred a few times a year. Those who said that suicide was not a factor did not exclude it from happening in certain rare occasions. One cannot say it is impossible for the threat of suicide to arise. That gives rise to the question at the other end of the spectrum as to the propriety or otherwise of total exclusion.</P>

      <P>If there is any change, it will clearly be the result of the pressure being put on the Government by the Labour Party and others in the House. We are united in highlighting this essential matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last four years Ireland has become an increasingly wealthy and, at the same time, increasingly unequal society. We have one of the highest levels of income inequality in the European Union. The gap has widened dramatically in the last four years. The top 10% of the population now have disposable income 13 times greater than the poorest 10%. This has not happened by accident, rather it is the legacy of an ideologically-driven Government which continues, even <Col N="873" /> to this day, to deepen the divide. Nowhere is this divide more evident than in our health service.</P>
    <P>We have great health professionals working to deliver care to their patients, but they work in a uniquely dysfunctional system which discriminates against the poor in favour of the rich. We have a two tier health system based on a kind of Irish apartheid which would not be tolerated in any other EU state and which is rapidly becoming unacceptable to the broad majority here. The public is ahead of the Government in its desire for change. People are genuinely appalled at the discrimination which ensures, at hospital level, private patients can access the quality care they need when they need it while public patients often end up on long waiting lists. Even a visit to the family doctor is not exempt from injustice. Those on very low incomes who do not have medical cards are forced to pay the full price to see their family doctor or do without the care they need and suffer the consequences. Such people include the single person living alone whose income exceeds £100 per week or the married couple with two children living on an income of just over £9,000 per year. These are people who are already struggling to pay their household bills and for whom a medical bill constitutes a crippling burden. If other European citizens do not tolerate such inequality, why should we?</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, launched his health strategy. It was the occasion of lavish PR, clever media management and a benign, if bewildered, public response. It was also four years overdue. Starting out in government with a strategic policy makes good sense. Waiting until the dying months of an Administration leaves the Minister vulnerable to the criticism that this was a political stunt. Be that as it may, there are some good elements in the health strategy, though it is still a failure. It fails to address the central challenge of health care reform. It does not deliver equality. Despite its title, Quality and Fairness, it is a ten year plan designed to perpetuate unfairness in health care. That was a disappointment in itself, but worse was to come.</P>
    <P>Two days later the Government's primary care strategy was launched and the result can only be described as a disaster. An overly ambitious billion pound plan was reduced to tatters when the Minister admitted that, far from delivering equality at primary care level, the Government had decided to freeze any increase in income limits to qualify for a medical card for the duration of its lifetime. It is a decision that has been described as deeply disappointing, callous and cruel and even as obscene. It is also a decision that can be reversed, which is the reason the Labour Party has tabled this motion and it is seeking majority support across the House.</P>
    <P>The first line of the Government document states, &ldquo;Primary care is the first point of contact that people have with the health and personal social services.&rdquo; The harsh reality is that for thousands this is simply untrue. They cannot access <Col N="874" /> primary care because it costs too much. They end up in accident and emergency departments because their health has deteriorated or it is their only route to treatment. The Government is on record as stating that an additional 200,000 or so people should have medical cards. We, in the Labour Party, go further by asserting that primary care should be free at the point of delivery. Even if the Government was simply to live up to its own commitment, it would make a significant difference to the lives and health of up to 250,000 people on low incomes. The Minister justified his decision to exclude them on the grounds that their unmet needs would put pressure on the service. This is a terrible admission. Is he really saying the unmet need is so great that he cannot set about meeting it now?</P>
    <P>It is clear that general practitioners &ndash; they should know since they deliver primary care &ndash; do not agree with the Minister and they are so keen for this improvement to be made now that the Irish Medical Organisation has issued a strong warning to him by stating that failure in the forthcoming budget to commit to the extension of the medical card would be a failure to meet the health care needs of the 250,000 who need it most. This, the IMO stated, would only lend currency to those who say the health strategy is no more than an expensive election ploy. A leading GP, Professor Tom O'Dowd, revealed that a recent survey in his practice showed that a quarter of his patients were put off going to the doctor because of the cost. I hope the Minister does not try to convince us that we cannot afford to extend medical cards to the people concerned. The recently leaked value-for-money audit carried out in the health service found that the current medical card scheme is excellent value for money. Nevertheless, the Minister is ignoring that expert opinion as well as the opinion of medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>When the Minister extended medical cards to the highest income group among the over 70s he got it wrong. He introduced inequity into the GMS system for the first time. General practitioners are rewarded three or four times as much to care for this group of medical card holders as they are for caring for the poorest in our society. The Minister has thereby introduced, for the first time, incentives to attract GPs out of areas of deprivation and to set up practices in high income areas instead. Already we know that in areas of deprivation there are up to three times fewer GPs <i>per capita</i>, yet the only significant legacy of a Minister who has talked about fairness in the health service has been to make that service more iniquitous. When the Government took the decision to extend medical cards to the over 70s, it did not get its sums right. It estimated 30,000 would apply according to a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled some time ago. Already, 52,500 have applied.</P>
    <P>The Minister says his decision results from setting priorities, but does not explain the reason he ignored the advice of doctors, value for money <Col N="875" /> experts and even his own officials. The chief medical officer in the Department of Health and Children in his annual report on the health of children stated:</P>
    <P>Specific policy measures, which redistribute resources and provide opportunities and services for families with children, especially poor children, will do most to create better health provision. For this reason basic universal health provision, such as free access to primary care for all children, should be considered.</P>
    <P>Despite the good advice and promises made by the Government, the Minister has turned a deaf ear. On Monday he launched a health strategy which promised that &ldquo;significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card.&rdquo; By Wednesday the truth emerged that this commitment was not worth the paper on which it was written. It seems the Minister was so bedazzled by his ten year primary care plan that he could not see the real needs to be met.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party recognises the central role of primary care in good health care delivery, but we warn the Minister against trying to import into our system the clapped-out British ideas from the 1970s upon which his strategy relies so heavily. He ignores the strengths of the Irish system at his peril. It is vital to maintain and enhance the personal relationship between patients and their doctors. We oppose any proposal which puts barriers between patient and doctor. The proposed triage system could end up with a patient having to get approval from another health professional before he or she can access his or her doctor. No member of the public seeks such a change. It is not good practice and unnecessary. It is also not within the Irish tradition of personal health care. In Ireland people who can afford it or are on medical cards have direct access to the general practitioner of their choice. What is being sought is that such access be guaranteed to 200,000 people on low incomes in order that they can have the security and access for themselves and their children which is denied to them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about primary care reform, he should also commit himself to a free GP service at the point of delivery as the Labour Party has done. He should be less grandiose in his plans to reform primary care and concentrate on the needs of patients. There is nothing to stop him from extending the medical card scheme as the first step towards a free GP service, encouraging the growth of group practices, integrating community nursing with practice nursing, providing incentives for GPs working in areas of high deprivation, guaranteeing patient registration by way of a comprehensive GP scheme, ensuring the regulation and standard-setting concerning out-of-hours emergency services, whether by co-op, rota or commercial deputising, or building the capacity of primary care to deal with prevention, <Col N="876" /> rehabilitation and the management of chronic long-term illnesses. These measures would significantly improve Irish primary care while retaining its strengths and making it more accessible. We, in the Labour Party, propose real reform of primary care rather than the overblown proposals from abroad upon which the Minister sets such store.</P>
    <P>The motion is of great importance to people throughout the country. I have no doubt as the debate continues that clear evidence will be given about the suffering and hardship caused as a result of people being unable to access their family doctor. I urge the Minister to accept the motion. He has a chance to put right a terrible wrong being done to families and children who are denied a basic right to medical care. Surely the time has come when the Government and the House can make a simple guarantee of quality and fairness to those who need it most.</P>

      <P>An Irish singer named Johnny Logan won the Eurovision Song Contest with a memorable song called &ldquo;What's Another Year.&rdquo; The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is giving his swansong to a whole category of people by saying to them &ldquo;what's another year&rdquo; and that they can simply wait. By deciding not to increase the income eligibility limits for access to the medical card system, the Minister has inexplicably penalised upwards of 200,000 people. Will he, if he can, justify the reason he has made this ideological choice? He said last week in the House that he had decided to give people over the age of 70 years the medical card without reference to income. As Deputy McManus said, in making that decision he interfered fundamentally with the basis on which the general medical service system works and introduced structured inequality into the application of the GMS in its current form.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not have seen earlier this evening on the &ldquo;Six-One&rdquo; news the report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul condemning outrightly the failure of the Government to do what could be done and what the country could afford to do, which is to give, for the sum of approximately £80 million a year, the medical card to upwards of 200,000 people. That is more than the entire population of the city of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Administration has been in government for four and a half years and is the most favoured in the history of the State. It inherited an economic framework unrivalled by that of any previous incoming Administration, a framework which was further underpinned by the stability introduced by Ireland's membership of the euro zone, which meant lower interest rates and exchange rate stability, and ensured the economy grew at an unprecedented rate creating levels of wealth and growth undreamed of by any forecaster or economist. Looking back on that four and a half years, on what was achieved and where the key choices were made by the Government, we begin to see a pattern which reveals an ideological choice which is undeniably right of centre. <Col N="877" /> The choice of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, between rich and poor in terms of reducing taxes, whether it be capital gains tax, the top rate of income tax, changes in the thresholds, capital acquisitions tax or a range of other areas, has always been to opt for the smaller group who least need the type of support given to them. This is reflected in the decision of the Minister for Health and Children to give people over 70 the medical card and enhance the operation of the terms and conditions of the GMS to ensure doctors complied with its operation. Many over 70 do not need the support of the medical card system, which is the argument made by general practitioners.</P>
    <P>I do not like the GMS system. It is a Third World type of operation for a country which developed it and the concept of the medical card, or the blue card as it was originally called, at a time when this was a very poor country. While we are no longer a poor economy, we are still an impoverished society. As Deputy McDowell said outside the House, now that we have achieved the average <i>per capita</i> income of the rest of the European Union, we need to achieve a similar level of public service. One of the key areas where the quality of that service can be measured is in access to health services in general and primary care, in particular.</P>
    <P>The reason the Labour Party has proposed and will implement, if we are in a position to do so, a system of free access to primary care is because two out of three people must pay to go and see a doctor. That is the reality. Our measure, small as it is, would at least extend that facility to another 200,000 people. If the child of a young parent on the average industrial income and without a medical card becomes sick for the third time in a month &ndash; they tend to become sick at night and other inconvenient times as anyone who is a parent knows &ndash; the one thing that parent should be able to do, especially where he or she is detached from family supports because of where he or she lives and where he or she is trying to discern whether the cough is a bad cold or possibly symptoms of meningitis, is access primary care without fear, certainly without the fear of wondering if he or she can afford to pay. Going to see or asking a doctor to make a house call will cost £30 of a person's wages after tax. In effect, it represents a sum closer to £40 of somebody's gross wages. That barrier of fear and denial should no longer be in place.</P>
    <P>Access to a properly resourced and established primary care system should have been provided by this Administration. It cannot plead what previous Administrations could legitimately claim, that the resources were not available. Neither are we saying that it can be done overnight. Some of us in opposition have experience of working in a Government that, over 15 months, published the most comprehensive health policy document ever produced by a political party. We know just how complex the task is. We do not claim to have all the detail of such a policy 100% correct, or that <Col N="878" /> the policy cannot be improved, or that aspects of it will not require the input of medical health providers. That is one of the reasons we have proposed that a medical forum should be an integral part of health policy.</P>
    <P>At the start of the 21st century the frightening reality is that we know more about the health profile of animals on this island than we do about our fellow citizens. The failure to establish a proper comprehensive primary care system with the necessary support for GPs has left us in a state of chaos and anarchy that prevents the system from delivering the sort of health care to which our citizens are entitled.</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister to do much. For the past four and a half years he has been a member of the Government whose budget allocation tomorrow will run to £19.5 billion. The Minister has undoubted political skills and influence in the Cabinet. All we are asking him to do is to obtain the extra money needed to increase eligibility income limits, thus enabling 200,000 more people to have medical cards. They have been left behind as a result of the failure to increase the limits in recent years. It was not an arbitrary decision, an accident or an imposed criterion over which the Minister had no control. That deliberate choice was made in recent years at a time when average income was increasing, through the PPF and other social partnership programmes, by the order of at least 8% per annum and in some cases by far more. The Government clearly recognised that a group of people would be consistently left behind as their incomes grew.</P>
    <P>In reply to a query from me the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children informed the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. John Hurley, that to restore the GMS system to the 40% of the population which, under the current agreement, should be entitled to access it would cost £116 million, based on March 2001 figures. These choices have been made, they have not happened by chance. We are asking the Minister to reverse these choices, and to change the direction of social policy in a manner that will have an immediate and direct impact on 200,000 people. He is in a position to do this. He can make changes elsewhere in his overall budget allocation and negotiate with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. We are asking him to do so by accepting our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow, mercifully, we will hear the last of the five budgets from the Government. It is a useful point at which to look back at its period in office. No Government has ever had it so good. No Government has ever had so much of the people's money to redistribute and invest. At the end of that four and a half year period it is shameful that the Government has decided that a couple with two children, earning £180 per week, cannot be given a medical card. Such people are effectively being told that if they need to see a doctor, they must pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> The decision not to extend medical card eligibility limits is one that affects all low-income families who must make daily decisions about their health, based on income rather than medical necessity. A parent with a sick child must decide whether to visit the doctor, a decision with which every parent can identify. For the 30% of parents who have medical cards, or those fortunate enough to be able to afford to visit a doctor, that decision is made solely on the basis of whether an ailment is sufficiently serious. For someone on low income, however, the decision on whether to visit the doctor is a financial one. Going to the doctor is not just about the £20 or £25 fee, it also concerns the cost of any prescription the doctor may write. A visit to the doctor with a sick child may end up costing £40 or £50. Many parents on low incomes will have to weigh up that cost against the price of school books, an electricity bill or other household costs. It is a major decision.</P>
    <P>People caught in this situation are on low incomes, saddled with big mortgages or paying high rents. The decision not to extend medical card eligibility levels is one of the cruellest that any Government has made. In its recent annual report, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul estimated that for the sum of £80 million the medical card scheme could be extended to another 200,000 people. The Minister, however, says, &ldquo;Sorry, we can't afford it.&rdquo; The Government takes that stand in the very week when £80 million was found by his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to provide additional compensation for farmers and landowners who have spent the last year obstructing the building of new national roads, but, of course, the IFA is a powerful lobby, unlike a mother with a sick child. That is the reason the Government has turned its back on the sick and the poor. It has done so, however, against the advise of the Minister's own chief medical officer who stated in a report earlier this year that no child should be prevented from having access to a doctor simply on the basis that its parents cannot afford the doctor's fee or the prescription costs involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister took office on the strength of the slogan, &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.&rdquo;  I agree with that slogan because the hurt caused by health cuts is never justified. Given the resources the Government has had available to it for the past four and a half years, there is no justification now for it to turn its back on those who cannot afford to go to the doctor.</P>

      <P>I support my party's motion. The issue of medical cards has been one on which I have campaigned passionately all my political life. I know intimately the hardship thousands of families experience in my constituency by being denied a medical card which should be available as an entitlement rather than constituents having to go cap in hand to politicians when <Col N="880" /> in difficulty. Every Member constantly makes representations to health boards on behalf of persons in dire need. My constituency of Kerry South is no different. I was interested to read in this morning's edition of <i>The Kingdom</i> that my constituency colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, said:</P>

      <P>It should not be the case that an application for a medical card brought to the Chief Whip by one of the Government's Independents should receive more preferential treatment than any other. Will the Government Chief Whip treat those who have made representations to me or any other Deputy in the same way as those who have made representations to the Independents who support the Government?</P>
      <P>During the past four and a half years the Government's Independents have had ample opportunity to assert their so-called independence in which task they have failed miserably. They have proven that they are just so-called &ldquo;Independents.&rdquo; The vote at the end of this debate offers them another chance to carry out the mandate their constituents gave them at the last election which was to act, legislate and vote as Independents. I earnestly appeal to the Independents, particularly those who support the Government, to vote in favour of the Labour Party motion and exercise real independence for the sake of the 200,000 people up and down the country in dire need of medial cards. I had a woman in my office yesterday who has two children. Last week she took them to the doctor at a cost of £60. One night during the same week she had to call the doctor to the house at a cost of £45. This means she had to pay out £105 in one week. Is the Minister telling me she is not in dire need? She is self-employed and is a few bob over the limit.</P>

Thousands of children up and down the country continue to live in poverty because they do not have access to primary medical care.

      <P>The people being penalised are among the most hard pressed workers. Manual workers earn little more than the minimum wage and struggle to make ends meet on a tight budget. The Minister for Health and Children and his colleagues in Cabinet have decided these are the people who must pay the price for the health strategy. They will get in the way of its delivery and, therefore, will be written out of the equation. It is as simple and as straightforward as that. It is a disgrace. Clearly, the Minister does not understand the enormity of what he is proposing. In answer to a Private Notice Question in the House on Thursday last he singularly failed to address the core issue &ndash; why, with the advent of the Government health strategy, are the most needy families about to lose out. It is a simple question and the Minister did not even try to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us face the facts. A citizen with an income of over £5,200 must pay every time they visit their general practitioner. A working parent earning £324 gross per week would need to have ten children to qualify for a medical card. Low paid <Col N="882" /> workers are denied free access to a GP. Under the Government this will continue to be the case. The Minister talks continually of ten year plans and establishing priorities. Much of this is arrogant waffle. The Minister has no power, jurisdiction or mandate to speak of Government health plans for the next ten years. At most the Government has six months to run. There is no Government health strategy for the next ten years. That matter will be decided by the people at the next general election. It is they, through their choice at the ballot box, who will determine health strategy for the duration of the next Government. This point appears to have escaped the Minister. However, it will be brought home to him time and again in the next few months.</P>
    <P>Having made such an appalling mess of health strategy since 1997 I can understand the reason the Government wants to sweep that failure under the carpet and fast forward to 2011. It will not wash. The Government has a disastrous record in the health service. At a time of unprecedented wealth it has failed to give the people the health service they deserve by right. It has stood over a two tier health system and watched hospital waiting lists grow. Popular frustration with the health service has never been worse. Is this the outfit people want to chart health care reform in the next ten years? One must be joking.</P>
    <P>The final act in the health area by the Government is the decision to freeze medical card income limits. The Minister may deny it, but his backbench colleagues, who have retained some degree of reality in the past five years, know this only too well. The Government has targeted some of the poorest families in the State. Some families will lose their entitlement to a medical card while others will be denied free access to primary health care. I know the effect of this on the ground: parents will go without to get their children to the doctor, single parents will put off visiting a doctor because they cannot afford it while accident and emergency units in acute hospitals will be busier than ever. It is a disastrous mean-minded stupid decision, but then what can we expect from a Government which forced the nurses onto the picket line?</P>

      <P>Last week saw the launch of the mot comprehensive and ambitious strategy in the history of the health service. The strategy addresses every element of the service and points the way forward to a permanent end to many long-entrenched problems. The public and professional response has been extremely positive with patients' representatives calling it &ldquo;welcome, and well thought out.&rdquo; One of the big departures in the strategy is the fact that specific commitments are given and direct responsibility is allocated for implementation. In this context it might have been expected that the Opposition would be interested in a serious debate about the strategy. Most reasonable people would have assumed that <Col N="884" /> our time could be best used by talking about the programme of development and reform set out. Of course, when one is dealing with the Opposition the expectations of reasonable people will always be disappointed and once again we are confronted with the desperate attempt of an Opposition overwhelmed by the indifference of the public to claw its way into contention. It has decided that the health strategy will provide it with the electoral magic bullet that will achieve what two new leaders and a merger have not achieved.</P>
      <P>The basic premise of the posturing of the Opposition parties on this issue is that everything can be done at once. As far as it is concerned, every element of the health strategy that is not implemented within the next few months will represent a betrayal. Under the Opposition we would have a perfect world where everything would move at once. It did not mention this evening that the policy it is condemning was one it pursued throughout its term of office during the rainbow coalition Government.</P>

      <P>The Opposition parties sat down together to decide income guidelines for medical cards and decided against implementing any real term increase during its term of office. There were no increases at any stage during Deputy Quinn's term as Minister for Finance or Deputy Noonan's term as Minister for Health. They agreed that indexation was an appropriate response. It seems once again the Opposition believes we are to be condemned while it is to be allowed to ignore its record. In contrast we have now proposed to move beyond indexation and to <Col N="885" /> do so as part of the stepped implementation of actions, but the Opposition roars as if we have reversed a policy, as if we are cutting back. It is the same sort of approach it has had to many Government policies.</P>
      <P>What I find most curious about the Opposition's position is that it continues to make it up as it goes along. Last week Labour tabled this motion and Fine Gael agreed to support it. It would entail significant additional expenditure next year. Yet on Sunday Labour launched its pre-budget statement, but failed to mention medical cards or health. It recommended major borrowing and spending relating to a range of projects, but no provision whatsoever for medical cards.</P>
      <P>In this fact is laid bare the motivation and tactics of the Labour Party. It is to refuse to engage with the detail of the strategy because one cannot beat the best researched and best received strategy of its type ever launched, concentrate on one point and hype it up. Some members of the Labour Party have enjoyed talking about the need for joined-up policies. Where is the join between its budgetary policy and this new decision where medical cards are the number one issue? Welfare, tax, roads, carers, child benefit and housing are mentioned, but there is not one word about health, not one word on the issue about which it is seeking to condemn the Government tonight.</P>
      <P>The high rhetoric of empathy is once again revealed to be without substance or credibility. One year after it began an orgy of self-praise, the Labour Party has honoured us with a redraft of its quick fix answer to everything. After one year it contained less substance than the first draft. Last year it admitted that a whole new layer of administration would lead to more administrative costs. This year apparently there will be none, even though every similar system across the globe has significantly higher administrative costs than ours.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, however, has had even more difficulty keeping its line together. In February last year its spokesperson said:</P>
      <P>Our health service requires radical reform. Whether the necessary reform can be brought about by the introduction of a universal health insurance system is questionable. What is needed is less, not more, bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Its new leader said on 28 May this year, &ldquo;If you go in first and announce a universal insurance system, the whole service would just end up like the present accident and emergency chaos.&rdquo; Yet Deputy Mitchell told us on 11 November that they were committed to prioritising an insurance-based system.</P>
      <P>One can talk all one wants about equity, but the bottom line is that this is the first Government ever to set out a comprehensive programme for delivering high class and accessible health care for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Equity in health care is not only about the income guidelines for medical cards. It is about a full range of services and supports. Equity is a core principle on which the strategy is based and one which the Government is committed to addressing in the implementation of the strategy and through service development across the board. The overriding necessity in relation to equity, as was well recognised in the submissions to the national anti-poverty strategy review, is the need for access to services.</P>
      <P>Services have to be built up, waiting lists reduced, activity increased and specific groups such as children and those with disabilities require targeted service developments if equity is to be served in a meaningful way. A broad strategic focus is essential to deal with these sorts of problems and no single narrow approach will address the real need for better and more equitable health care services for all.</P>
      <P>Before we let the Opposition away with its repeated accusation that the strategy is a last ditch attempt to gain support or that we have been doing nothing for four and a half years, once again the truth is its enemy. More and better paid professionals are delivering significantly more care and services to significantly more people. Waiting lists are down. There have been unprecedented increases in hospital activity. There have been very significant increases in places for the intellectually disabled whose service needs had been all but ignored previously. There is a much enhanced framework for mental health services coupled with much increased targeted investment. Some £41 million has been committed to the implementation of the cardiovascular strategy with the first progress report of the health heart task force completed and launched, and there have been many more advances in cancer treatment services and other services.</P>
      <P>Real advances in health and personal social services over the past few years have come as a result of our new and strategic approach to the health services coupled with the most significant programme of investment in health care ever undertaken. Spending has more than doubled since 1997. The overall budget for 2002 is 7.75 billion, or £6.1 billion, representing an increase of 135% since 1997. That is not an illustration of some ideological right wing orientation, as alleged by the Labour Party and its leader. This shows a much greater commitment to health than any previous administration. A year ago the Opposition's big attack was that we were refusing to allocate extra funds to health, today it has abandoned that argument in face of the weight of increases we have put in place. Its only consistent approach is attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is interested in equity, one must be concerned with the often prohibitive cost of prescription drugs. That is why we introduced the drug payment scheme to replace the schemes where <Col N="887" /> patients reclaimed drug expenditure from health boards. Under the DPS no individual or family need pay more than £42 per month for approved prescribed drugs and non-medicine items from their community pharmacist.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been extremely successful. It provides an effective and streamlined point of contact service for more than 950,000 people. Patients no longer need to seek reimbursement from their local health board for prescription expenditure above the threshold, with obvious financial benefits for thousands of families. The total of 950,000 DPS cardholders represents a 36% increase, or 342,000 people, in only one year. The total possible registration is 2.4 million people. All these people can benefit from this scheme which is so much easier to access than previous schemes and which removes the fear of excessive large drug bills. It is not surprising the Opposition has chosen tonight to ignore this major advance.</P>
    <P>If one is interested in equity, one must be concerned with the fact that poorer people have to wait longer for necessary treatment. That is why we have been working hard to reduce, and have shown how we will permanently eliminate, waiting lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition is aware of the figures but chooses to ignore them. The number of people on public hospital waiting lists in June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was down 13% on the comparable figure for the day we took office. During last year there were significant reductions in the waiting lists for target specialties, with the number waiting for cardiac surgery down by 52%, the number waiting for gynaecology procedures down by 35% and the number waiting for ENT procedures down by 30%.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has also been made in reducing waiting times. During the period June 2000 to June 2001 the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for cardiac surgery had decreased by 68%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services had decreased by 38% and the number waiting for orthopaedic services had decreased by 16%. During the same period the number of children waiting for more than six months for cardiac surgery had decreased by 85%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services had decreased by 31% and the number waiting for ENT services had decreased by 25%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are continuing evidence that the level of targeted funding provided by the Government is achieving results. In spite of this, we saw Fine Gael last week publish a directly misleading leaflet in which it stated that &ldquo;waiting lists are still rising dramatically&rdquo;. The facts show a decline, but the Opposition does not like the facts so it makes up its own. Perhaps Fine Gael has adopted <Col N="888" /> Labour's most creative attack, where the baseline figure used is January 1997 rather than June 1997. By doing this we become responsible for the unprecedented increase of 4,500 that took place as a direct result of a Labour Minister for Finance and a Fine Gael Minister for Health getting together and deciding to cut back dedicated waiting list funding.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy goes back in time to the beginning of the rainbow coalition, he will see that waiting lists increased by a huge 28% during the Quinn-Noonan golden era of the health service.</P>
      <P>The key to reducing and ending waiting lists is capacity and effective management of treatment lists. The strategy on the way forward is clear. Next year will see the largest ever concentrated expansion in acute hospital capacity. That will end over 12 months of waiting for adults and over six month waiting for children. This target will be delivered because of the major foundation already in place in recent years. This year alone will see a 6% &ndash; 52,000 in-patient numbers &ndash; increase over last year in the number of patients treated in our acute hospital system.</P>
      <P>If one is really interested in equity, one must also be concerned with the significant differences in health status that occur between groups. This is the first time any health strategy has comprehensively addressed the issue of health inequalities. It sets out a range of actions specifically directed at disadvantaged groups and which are concerned with ensuring these groups do not continue to suffer most ill-health. The most important action we can take for disadvantaged groups is to ensure they do not get sick in the first instance or that they do not suffer the current disparities in health. Actions to reduce inequalities include implementing a programme of actions to achieve new national anti-poverty strategy and health targets for the reduction of health inequalities. In addition, there are provisions to eliminate the barriers for disadvantaged groups, in terms of making healthier choices easier for these groups, supporting them at community level to understand and access services, as well as specific programmes of action for groups such as Travellers, the homeless, drug misusers, prisoners and asylum seekers and refugees, all of whom have a real risk of poor health status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is really interested in equity, one must be concerned with fair access for all. The strategy sets out a comprehensive plan to ensure equal <Col N="889" /> access for equal need is a core value for the delivery of publicly funded health services. There are different strands to this goal. The first involves clarifying eligibility through legislation and communication with hard to reach groups.</P>
    <P>The actions set out in the strategy will ensure all those eligible understand their entitlement, can easily access the services they need and can be sure that regardless of where they live there is a standard approach to their eligibility for services. It will also see a major extension in eligibility. The basic policy of indexation is one followed under Deputies Quinn and Noonan. The idea that we are taking services from people or that next year will see a major reduction in entitlement is a travesty of the truth. If indexation is to be condemned, then every member of the Opposition who voted for indexation is also subject to condemnation.</P>
    <P>The strategy recognises that the issue of health services for disadvantaged groups is a complex one which needs to be tackled in a number of ways, both in terms of ensuring, first, that people are healthier and are less likely to need health and personal social services and, second, that when they do, barriers such as transport or opening times do not prevent them from accessing the services they require.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, on which work will either begin straightaway or has already begun, the Government has set out a range of measures to make more people eligible for services. The commitment to their introduction is clearly stated in the strategy and we will deliver.</P>
    <P>It is clear there are other barriers to equity in the system, and these have been prioritised to ensure that in the future the eligibility framework can readily support equal access for equal need. The Government is fully committed to extending medical card coverage to more people on low incomes, including targeted increases, to ensure more children are covered by way of these measures in the course of the strategy. Such actions always have to be considered in the light of the full range of priorities which arise in relation to health services.</P>
    <P>The Opposition's only priority is whatever might grab a headline at a particular time. It steadfastly refuses to state which of its promises will have to wait.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Older people will also benefit substantially under the strategy. Our commitment is for a total of 1,370 extra assessment and rehabilitation places, 600 extra day places and 800 extra residential-community nursing places per annum each year in the next seven years. These improve<Col N="891" /> ments will bring tangible benefits for older people.</P>

The extension of medical cards to the over 70s is wholly consistent with Government policy towards improving the position of the elderly and was a logical consequence of the three year phased doubling of income limits initiated in March 1999. Before the last election the one commitment we gave on medical cards was that we would double eligibility over three years for people aged over 70 years. We have delivered on that promise&mdash;</P>

      <P>Throughout last year, one week we were being condemned for not concluding a deal with the Irish Medical Organisation for the over 70s, but when we concluded a deal the following week we were condemned for concluding it.</P>
      <P>If one is really interested in equity, one has to be concerned also with our underdeveloped primary care system. Our new departure on primary care gives it a central role in the future development of our health services. It provides the policy framework to advance equity and recognises the need to address inequalities in accessing the services people need most.</P>
      <P>Access to primary care services is of crucial concern to the Government as is shown in the new primary care model that was so well received last week. Many services are not as available as we would like throughout the country. This model seeks to address this problem by putting in place co-ordinated, integrated one-stop-shops for service that will be of particular benefit to older people and medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The primary care strategy is a radical, long-term programme which needs to build up momentum as quickly as possible to achieve the targets we have set. The consultation process has demonstrated to us the great value the public places on community based services. The public has recognised what international research tells us, that we can do much more to keep people well and independent as well as to improve the quality of life of those who are ill or have a disability by working at a community level in broad based terms. A properly integrated primary care service can lead to better outcomes, better health status and better cost effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have prioritised as a first step the national development of 24 hour, seven day GP co-operatives. These will be supported by the immediate establishment of a primary care task force to help drive the roll-out of the new model. The emphasis will be on putting together primary care teams which can meet the needs of patients and clients effectively. Patients will have the option of enrolling with these teams and with an individual general practitioner. If they so wish, they will be able to self-<Col N="893" /> refer to any member of the team. This model offers the way forward. It will change utterly the way in which we deliver primary care services and will be hugely important in helping to streamline the delivery of patients and clients to other more specialist services, both within and beyond the community setting.</P>
    <P>Anyone really interested in equity and delivering quality care for all must support a move to end the days of the quick fix sloganeering which has so often dominated debates on health in this country.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately tonight's debate is part of the old way of doing business. It is an attempt by a desperate Opposition to get some attention and damage a more substantive and credible health strategy than they could ever produce. It will not work. Nobody believes that everything can be done at once. Deputy McDowell's statement does not even mention medical cards as a priority for tomorrow's budget. People will see that the Opposition is unwilling to say what it will do and when it will do it. Over the coming months they will see an Opposition becoming ever more negative and shrill, trying to pick short-term holes in a solid long-term strategy.</P>
      <P>The Opposition keeps on arguing for quick fixes, refusing to prioritise, attacking us for implementing policies which it followed and producing leaflets based on misleading figures. We will get on with the substance of delivery and will face into the future. The public will recognise credible and sustainable policies over those with shelf lives as long as a sound bite.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to the Labour Party for providing this opportunity to address the issue of health service reform. The health strategy is now synonymous with health reform. It is plainly the way forward. Anyone familiar with my area of responsibility &ndash; food safety and older people &ndash; will understand how truly exciting the strategy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> The partnership approach which, much to the ire of the people opposite, is the hallmark of this Government, is at the very core of the strategy. It incorporates the largest public consultation ever carried out in the health service. Members of the public were invited to describe their experiences of the health services and give their opinion on future policy. We received more than 1,500 submissions. We also commissioned market research involving a nationally representative group of over 2,000 adults. Added to this was partnership with the medical organisations and the medical personnel. When we talk about the health strategy we should not think of it as a Government document handed down from Hawkins House to be implemented below. It is a far more egalitarian strategy than has ever before been attempted in this area.</P>
    <P>This poses serious questions for the Opposition which it has yet to answer. Should it find itself in Government, would it scrap the partnership and thus ignore the commission on nursing, the strategic assessment of hospital capacity, the national consultative forum and the medical manpower report or reports from the National Council on Ageing and Older People? Would it disregard the 121 specific targets contained in the strategy? What of the specific deadlines along the road to reform?</P>
    <P>Labour has already asserted it would not water down its policies to enter Government. Having attacked the Government for taking too long in launching the strategy, would it return to the lengthy negotiations and research? Were it to adopt the sensible path and adopt the strategy, could we trust it to implement it?</P>

      <P>Considerable work has been done. We have not been sitting on our hands. As a direct result of our policies to date, there were 90,000 more treatments carried out in 2000 than in 1997 and 52,000 more treatments were carried out this year than in 2000. This is the largest ever increase in hospital activity. We have more than doubled the health spend to over £5 billion and it is plainly delivering. Staffing in the public health service is up from 68,000 in 1997 to about 86,000 today, which is 18,000 additional people working in the health system. One needs workers in the health system if one is to bring down waiting lists.</P>

      <P>Time has not stood still. While we prepared the health strategy, the job of reform was very much on hand and reform delivered. In the area of equity we have delivered medical cards to the over 70 age group and developed health targets as part of the national anti-poverty strategy. We have introduced the most significant improvements to services for people with a disability in the history of the State. All of this occurred prior to the introduction of the health strategy.</P>
      <P>Contrast this with the legacy of inaction left by the rainbow Administration. Other speakers, I am sure, will examine the Opposition's health policies. They are shallow and ultimately unworkable in the context of a large and complex health system in need of reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Without the policies of future reform and a record of past reform, the Opposition parties come before the House once more to talk about equity in the health system. No one will buy it. Equity is a far broader issue than medical cards. Nevertheless we will increase income guidelines for the medical card &ndash; it is in the strategy. The provision of real and lasting equity in our health service involves a broader, more strategic approach which will ensure that services are built up and can be accessed by all those who need them.</P>
      <P>It is cynical for those opposite, who failed to increase medical card eligibility in any significant manner while in Government and whose policies would not increase equity in the health system, to feign concern tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Opposition this debate is not about health reform or equity, but using the issue of health for purely political ends. The new health strategy represents the way forward in terms of health reform. In my area of responsibility, the health and well-being of older people, it will greatly improve the quality and degree of care provided. In terms of community services it involves the provision of 7,000 additional day centre places, increased funding for appliances and aids in the homes of older people and recruitment of additional staff to support a wide range of primary care services, such as domiciliary care and day and respite services. In terms of hospital services it involves 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds and 600 additional day places.</P>
      <P>Contrast the new health strategy with the uncosted ambiguity of the Opposition. The strategy is specific, with concrete targets and concrete means of achieving them. It outlines what has to be done, how and when it will be done and who is responsible for getting it done. Reforming the health service and providing equity of access and treatment is a serious, complex business. Those parties which have little or no Government record of health reform and did not increase equity in terms of health or social welfare in Government now stand before us as would be champions of equity. The people whose policies would shut local hospitals and increase administration costs now tell us they have a better way. Nobody will buy that agenda.</P>

The Minister and the Minister of State talked about what they call a specific health strategy. However, it is about as specific as the one they put forward in 1993. Action 38 on page 166 of that specific document refers to the scope of eligibility framework being broadened. It states that income guidelines for the medical card will be increased and it refers to this being deliverable. There is an asterisk after &ldquo;target date&rdquo; for the revised income guidelines which relates to the statement that the timing of the introduction of action 38 will be decided by the Government in the context of the prevailing budgetary situation.</P>

The Ministers do not know about this yet because they were not told. The Minister said the Opposition wants everything at once, but that is not the case. We want the poor and not the rich put first. I will return to this point later.</P>
      <P>A well meaning journalist, who is a decent person, wrote a column last weekend in which she appeared to suggest that Deputies would have a better time writing to their constituents, enclosing medical cards. We do not do that but some of my constituents sit at home alone in cold houses. They have an income of £101 a week, but they cannot get medical cards. I would not mind writing to tell them that an exception had been made and they will be granted medical cards. If anybody in this House had to pay 30% of their income every time he or she visited a doctor, how many of us would go? The Minister claims to be concerned about reform, fairness and quality but he kicked in the backside, those people with incomes of £101 a week. He gave medical cards to wealthy, retired businessmen who voted for him and he left out the very poor. Such people do not go to doctors and I will return to this point later.</P>

However, it did not refer to the activities of the devious Minister who, in the week of a by-election, caved in and gave £250 a head to the IMO to get it to abandon its argument with him about giving priority to the poor. The Minister gave the IMO five times the norm and he also gave it a deal on secretaries. It thought all its birthdays had come at once.

They will not be covered by the Minister's 12 month guarantee because he has no interest in them.</P>
      <P>The Minister packed the Blood Transfusion Board with his cronies from his bailiwick for his own advantage. This service needs to have confidence in it restored and it was an outrageous action by the Minister, as I told the House previously. It was outrageous that the Minister undermined the board and this ultimately led to the resignation of its chairman. The Minister leaked information about 1,000 extra consultants months ago, but the report still has not been published. He is at loggerheads with the Department of Finance&mdash;</P>

When the chairman resigned, her letters were published and we saw the references to the Minister's political hacks. Those were her words, not mine.</P>
      <P>At the Ballymascanlon discussions, the Minister wanted 5,000 extra beds. His plan now states that 3,000 extra beds will be provided over the next ten years. The Minister hid the Deloitte &amp; Touche value for money report, which he did not commission. The Government commissioned it because it is fed up with him pouring money into a black hole and because he does not have the ability to take a decision and deal with the issues.</P>
      <P>During a time of plenty, the Minister made a mess of public services. The country had unprecedented wealth and first class services could have been created. The Minister wants to appoint a board, in addition to Comhairle na nOspidéal, called the hospital authority or hospital board because he cannot take a decision on the role of Comhairle na nOspidéal. He cannot decide where cancer services should be located. He does not want to upset a few people so he proposes to establish another board. No other country the size of Ireland has two boards dealing with hospitals. The Minister makes this proposal in what he considers his marvellous document.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, told the Minister, Deputy Martin, to get lost. He also told the Minister, Deputy Martin, that he could not pour any more money into a black hole. The Minister will not be allowed to repeat the mess he made of the Department of Education and Science in the Department of Health and Children. He rode on the back of decisions made by other Ministers and he came out smelling of roses. However, when Mr. Seán Cromien was sent into the Department to examine the management systems after the Minister left, he said they were in chaos. The Minister wants to preside over the health services in the same way and he hopes nobody will find out about it until after the election. The Minister has established more than 70 reviews, committees, standing groups and quangos. Everything is sent to a review group and none of them ever wind up. He has more quangos and review groups than Heinz has products.</P>

    <P>The Minister referred to the document I published last year. It is true that I made proposals in it and I said it was outrageous that the death rate of males over the age of 55 years is three times higher among lower income groups compared to higher income groups. I asked why the Minister for Health and Children recently extended the medical card entitlement at enormous expense to retired businessmen while leav<Col N="900" /> ing persons on incomes of £100 a week without medical cards. Why did the Minister not quote that statement from my document published in November 2000?</P>

      <P>The Minister has presided over a system of apartheid in the secondary care area and he has deliberately and wilfully extended apartheid to the primary care area. In the document published 13 months ago, I proposed the doubling of income limits for medical cards to bring them up to a decent level and to fill the State's 40% agreement with the IMO, as the organisation has sought. I proposed a doubling of the limit from £5,200 to £10,400 for a single person. Would that be too much given that £10,400 in this day and age is nothing? Doubling the income limits should not be out of the question. The limit for a married couple with two children should increase from £8,760. As it stands, they are disqualified from having a medical card if their income is above that sum. Even keeping it within the 40% level, doubling the amount would increase it to £19,720. That is still nothing to write home about for a family of four, but the Minister, Deputy Martin, did not do that. He did not look at giving the free GP service to children, as the chief medical officer in his own Department recommended and as I recommend before the CMO did in my document last November which contains these proposals to which the Minister referred, or at giving it to those over 65 only, as I suggested, after doubling the income limits. The Minister did not quote those things in his contribution.</P>
      <P>The Minister has missed a golden opportunity to do something decent. I do not mind him playing politics. I am used to his smiling face but when I grew up I was told, &ldquo;Handsome is as handsome does&rdquo;. The Minister is not handsome. He has let down the poor and he has done it deliberately while smiling into the camera. That is unpardonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I look across the floor of the House and I see a wary, tired Government. They are tired Ministers in every sense. They have lost their ideas and certainly they have lost the run of themselves.</P>
      <P>I have never had the pleasure of being a Minister. If one continually listens to the spin doctors, the Civil Service and the cameramen telling you &ldquo;how great thou art&rdquo;, I suppose you get carried away. That is what happened with this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight I listened carefully. I am told that £80 million will bring 200,000 into the medical card arena. In Opposition, we are accused of not providing answers. I can tell the Minister in two minutes where to find that £80 million. Since the <Col N="901" /> Government came into office, it has spent £130 million on consultants and it has 75 spin doctors. If it gets rid of the consultants and the spin doctors on 1 January, there will be 2,000 more who can have medical cards next year.</P>
    <P>What should I tell the woman who was at my constituency office on Saturday? She has four children and her husband brings home £321 a week. He pays £70 on the mortgage and he pays for his car which brings him to work. He, his wife and four children applied to the Western Health Board for the medical card and they did not qualify because his income is greater than that laid down in the guidelines. She said she did not ask the State for a house, for a car or for anything else and all she wants for her four children is a medical card.</P>
    <P>A medical card is worth £1,000 per year to a family. It is fine if one can afford to go to the doctor. In some parts of Mayo doctors charge £20 per visit in other parts of Mayo they charge £25 or £30. On average, therefore, doctors in Mayo charge £25. The other day I went to the doctor with a sore throat and he charged £25 straightaway. I went down to the chemist and spent another £30. I can afford it, but what about the poor woman on £321 a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>That &ldquo;man's wife&rdquo; said her child was sick last week. He had a sore throat &ndash; this complaint is prevalent at the moment, as the Minister of State, who is a doctor, will confirm. She said: &ldquo;I could not send him to school but I certainly could not send him to the doctor because I could not afford it.&rdquo; Is it not shameful in this day and age that there are such young families in this situation?</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office there has been one attack after another on the family. It has no respect for the family. One needs a medical card most when one has young children. Fine Gael proposes to give every family the medical card to cover every child from the day of birth until he or she reaches the age of 18. Does that not make sense? Why is the Government always looking after the rich? Since they took office, the rich have got richer, the poor have got poorer and the middle class is being squeezed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to a colleague refer to Deputy Healy-Rae. I do not know whether he qualifies for the medical card. If he is over 70, he does but I do not know his age. If he got one from the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, in the bag, it would not be the first bag which was brought into Fianna Fáil offices. In future, instead of writing to the health board and to the Minister, I will write to the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan. If Deputy Healy-Rae is right and if the Minister of State is handing out medical cards on a day-to-day basis, then the Minister of State can apply for the vacancy in the Western Health Board. The appeals officer is taking up a job in <Col N="902" /> the legal profession, which is another lucrative profession. If the Minister of State wants to apply for that job, there is a vacancy and he has enough friends within the health board.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and the Minister, Deputy Martin, telling us about all the money which is going into the health service. What they do not tell us is&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition did not give medical cards or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;what has happened over the past number of years. Let us look at the Western Health Board, the Minister of State's, Deputy Moffatt, health board area. When I became a Member of this House in 1997 it had one press officer now there are three press officers. I would not mind if they were spinning out good news, but this morning the first ten letters I got from the health board revealed, for example, that a woman in need of a cataract operation must wait 18 months, a man waiting for hip operation must wait 18 months and another man must wait for a prostate operation. In the case of the man waiting for a prostate operation, who has gone to Galway Hospital twice, I hope on the third occasion I will be able to get him that operation. If I do not, I will raise it on the Order of Business every morning until he gets it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has applied spin on the issue of money, but that is what is happening with the health boards and that is what is happening with the money. If he provided less money to consultants for reports and more money to medical consultants, there would not be half the problems.</P>
      <P>What is happening in the health boards at present is that, again, they are introducing new structures and new programme managers. There are more managers in the health board than at Manchester United. Up to a couple of weeks ago Manchester United was delivering, but the health service is not delivering. Something must be done.</P>
      <P>I put this challenge to the Government and to the Minister this evening. Let us put this health strategy before the people and let them decide whether they think it is a political gimmick. If the Minister thinks that he will send out the political masters from the health boards to sell this message, I have a message for the officials and for the health board. I will be there to meet them at every public meeting. I will bring people waiting for orthodontic services and I will bring people in wheelchairs who are waiting for hip operations to the meetings. When they have been through a meeting or two, they will tell the Minister that they will not go to any more public meetings. The Minister and the health boards should let the health board officials stay in their offices to administer the services. We are paying them to do that, not to go out to public halls telling the people how great is the service. The service provided is not a proper service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> I am sick and tired of people coming to me in tears because they must go to England to get their son to pay for their heart operation or hip operation. That is how the waiting lists are being reduced. The waiting lists are being reduced because people are getting the operations done privately and people are dying because they have not been provided with a service. The Government should be ashamed. As we approach Christmas, this is a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the total failure of the Government to deal with the problems of the ordinary people of Ireland. The IMO and the Government had an agreement in place for quite a long number of years that 39% of the people of Ireland would be covered by medical cards. Up until recently, the percentage covered was 29%, a reduction of 10%. That reduction took place because quite a substantial number of spouses or partners, who took up jobs which perhaps did not pay too well, ended up in a position where the income they received put them over the limit for the medical card.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years the IMO should have told the Government about this. I am wondering was it discussed during the negotiations when they were getting the IMO to agree to the provision of services for those over 70 years of age. The majority of the people who lost their cards tell us they cannot afford to bring their children to the doctor. As a result many children are going without proper medical care. We waited for four and a half years for this Government to produce a health strategy. We read in the weekend newspapers that it took 36 to 48 hours for that strategy to unravel. I am not surprised there is such a large number of civil servants in the House helping to keep the rest of the strategy together until the Minister for Finance arrives here tomorrow to agree to the demands of some of the independents who know a little more than the Ministers of the problems out there.</P>
      <P>The first phone call I had yesterday morning was from a man whose wife became very ill on Saturday and had to go into hospital in Dublin on Sunday. Up to yesterday morning at 10.30 a.m. she was still being treated on a trolley. That is the health service the Government says is working. There has not ever been so much money in the Department of Finance as there has been over the past four and a half years. The Department of Health and Children has not ever had so much money and yet people are still on trolleys in the same way they have been for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has ignored the realities of what is happening in our hospitals. The Minister said he would provide 650 new beds next year. How nice to do so in the year of an election. All he will do is re-open the beds that have been closed for the past four and a half years. Where are the consultants and nurses in the strategy who <Col N="904" /> will look after the patients when the beds are opened? They are not there at the moment.</P>

It would befit the Minister and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Dr. McDaid who has joined us, if reality struck the Government before 2 May, which I believe is the date for the general election. They might put money into services to look after people who are afraid to bring their children to the doctor, because of the costs involved. This Government has left 200,000 people short of care, 10% of the accepted figure of the IMO and the agreement with the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Labour Party for putting down this motion. I read the amendment tabled by the Government and one line in it almost jumped out at me: &ldquo;that the Government commends itself for the resources available to deal with hospital waiting lists&rdquo;. I find that an extraordinary statement. To put it down on paper is even more extraordinary. The reality is that all the Members of this House have people coming to them every day of the week seeking to try and jump queues and the waiting list to get into public hospitals.</P>
      <P>A young man of 34 years who has a tumour on his brain has to wait eight weeks to get into St. Luke's Hospital. In that period he had to go to the general hospital in Sligo three times. He had severe difficulties and went into a coma on one occasion. Despite that, he still had to wait for service and had to come to a politician like me to get into hospital.</P>
      <P>No politician should be put in that position but more particularly, no citizen should be. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt sat smugly and told Deputy Ring that Fine Gael did not do it when we were in Government. We did not, but we tried and we did not have the funding that has been available to this Government for the past four and a half years.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is unable to answer the tough questions. The health strategy he introduced has taken four and a half years to produce and has been launched just six months before a general election. If he thinks the electorate will buy that, he is mistaken. It is sin and spin. It is a sin that this Government has allowed people to remain on waiting lists for health services that are not available. If people are on public health waiting lists they do not get the services to which they are entitled. That is an indictment of the Government. It has failed miserably in trying to provide a health service.</P>
      <P>Each Deputy in this House is approached by many people trying to get into hospital for operations. The Minister did not have the courage of his convictions to put in place what is needed. Some 67% of all jobs last year in the health service were in administration. That is horrendous. What are they doing? Is it not more important to have hospital wards open and more nurses, doctors and consultants? That is where the money needs to be spent &ndash; at the coalface.</P>
      <P>People are leaving the medical profession because they do not have development opportunity due to being over-worked, over-stretched and starved of resources. What this Government has done in the past four and a half years is a disgrace in the management of the health services. Even with this health strategy, the issue in the next general election will be the mis-handling of the health services by this incompetent Government. I am glad we have the opportunity every so often to raise these issues in the House because we, as an Opposition, have come up with policies that we are willing to put in place that will give proper health services to all the citizens which is what they are justly entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion we put down stated that we want to ensure that poor people would get medical cards. The Government has turned it into a motion praising itself for its action on waiting lists. There are two eminent doctors on the Government bench and it is a shame this Government has not dealt with the waiting lists. We have a health strategy policy because the Government has suddenly realised, in its fifth year in office and in the run up to a general election, that there is a health crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A woman in my constituency had a relative who was called off a waiting list for a procedure. She had died seven years previously. This is documented fact in Galway. The longest period of time a person has been on a waiting list in Galway, acknowledged to me in a letter from the chief executive, is ten years. Is that any kind of health service? According to the strategy of the Government and the Department of Health and Children, adults must be on a waiting list no longer than 12 months and children no longer than six months. The figures for University College Hospital, Galway show that for ENT, there are 386 people on the list, that 262 of them, or 67%, have been waiting more than 12 months. <Col N="906" /> Some 122 people, or 44%, have been waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology, 103 or 80% have been waiting more than 12 months for plastic surgery and I could go on and on.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, spoke about appointing consultants. The Minister for Health, Deputy Martin, told me in reply to a Dáil question that a consultant neurologist was sanctioned for University College Hospital, Galway in January 2000. Because of the red tape involved that consultant has not yet been appointed and will not be appointed until well into next year, two years after sanctioning. Will the Government cop itself on about its health strategy, consultants and waiting lists?</P>

      <P>The crucial feature of the new health strategy is that it proposes to extend medical card coverage to cover more people on low incomes. It will also have an increased target to ensure more children are covered and that over 200,000 additional persons will be covered by medical cards during the period of the strategy. That is a stated commitment. We can say to the people that we will do this if returned to Government next year.</P>

      <P>It is not very clear what will happen if the Opposition is returned. Deputy Mitchell addressed the House this evening as the health spokesperson of the principal Opposition party and suggested that the decision of the Government to extend free medical card access to elderly persons was wrong. He instanced cases of persons who should not have obtained medical cards. Let us be realistic. There was a substantial increase in medical card provision last year which has to be accommodated by the medical profession and must be implemented through the health board system. That is being done. It is a cheap political gimmick for the Opposition parties, in an election year, to come out and promise the people medical cards they know they cannot give out. The people think all we are doing is engaging in cheap political games.</P>

      <P>They think we are engaging in cheap political games instead of addressing the real problems of the health service. The key problems of the health service are ones of priorities. This year the Government has committed additional funding to provide 650 extra acute hospital beds and is addressing the waiting list problem through a new treatment purchase fund. I agree with Deputies Reynolds and McCormack that the waiting list problem is the greatest scan<Col N="907" /> dal of our health service. That is the reason it is top of the list as far as Government priority is concerned in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The treatment purchase team will be established in 2002. It can buy services from both public and private hospitals to meet the defined laid out targets in the health strategy, but what has the Labour Party said to this? It suggests a further increase in free hospital coverage for the entire population. That will not be implemented by the end of 2002. It is an ambitious strategy which may have some intellectual merit, but it has a considerable problem. It would result in a vast increase in public expenditure on health services when we have already seen a substantial increase since the last general election in 1997.</P>
      <P>All Members of the House must recognise that management of the health service in an efficient cost effective way that provides a decent service for the patient should be our priority. There is no point coming in here week after week cherrypicking the health service and picking out one isolated issue and pretending that issue can be addressed through cheap abuse and point scoring off the Government. Let the Opposition face up to the fact that the Minister has produced a health strategy which has commanded and secured substantial public support.</P>

      <P>The increase in expenditure on the health service has been substantial under the present Administration. In fact, the historic under-provision in the health service was not addressed the last time the Labour Party had the health portfolio in the years from 1995 to 1997. I do not want to have to refer to those years, but if provoked on the issue, I will because the Government has a sound, well thought out, common sense strategy. What is most interesting about it is the confidence expressed in it by those who work to provide the health and medical service in this country.</P>

      <P>I thank the Opposition for providing the House with the opportunity to discuss the reform of the health system and, in particular, the medical card system. As Deputy Lenihan stated, this issue is being used as an exercise in political opportunism. I remind the House that the previous Minister for Health and Children is now the leader of the Fine Gael Party and the previous Minister for Finance is now the leader of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> We all know people who have been let down by a system that has been underfunded for decades and the frustration, hurt and anger which these failures have caused. For decades the system went underfunded, and crying out for reform, but in the two years prior to 1997, when Deputy Noonan was Minister for Health and Children and Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, when money was available&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;there was a notable absence of any Government commitment from those speaking on the issue tonight. I listened to Deputies Quinn, McManus, Gilmore and others tonight, but it is a fact that in the three budgets for which the Opposition was responsible during its period in government it never touched on the medical card issue. The Government, in the past four budgets, has consistently improved the medical card scheme, most notably last year when it extended it to include those over 70 years of age. The rhetoric of the Opposition is not matched by any workable policy now or any credible record of the past.</P>
      <P>Again, I remind Members that when Deputy Noonan was Minister for Health and Children and Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance they cut the waiting list budget in the winter of 1996 and 1997 from £12 million to £8 million. Are we now supposed to believe that they have had some form of Pauline conversion and that at last they are concerned about the health service? Their record does not stand up on this. Not once in three budgets did they touch on the medical card issue.</P>

      <P>Reforming the health system is a complex and long-term project which requires a thorough and workable strategy and sustained investment. It also requires specific targets and specific means of achieving them. It takes a hard neck for the Opposition, particularly Deputies Quinn and Noonan, to table a motion on health care and, above all, on medical card eligibility. While I welcome the Opposition's late interest, the people will not be fooled by this latest Pauline conversion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the medical card to those over the age of 70 years has made a huge difference to many who in their later years tend to suffer more from poorer and deteriorating health. It is a fact <Col N="909" /> of life that old people generally have more cause to visit their doctor than others. Medical cards are only one aspect of health reform. By extending eligibility at this time, a substantial amount of funding would be used in paying capitation fees to the general practitioners of cardholders. Figures of 200,000 to 250,000 people, to whom the scheme should be extended, were quoted tonight, but extension of eligibility will include many&mdash;</P>

      <P>I estimate that up to 80% of the people that the Labour Party wants to include will not need a medical card. A small percentage of young married couples with children should be included, but 80% of the 250,000 people whom the Labour Party wants to include will never need a medical card. They will be in pubs, sports clubs and discos while £80 million is paid in capitation fees to GPs.</P>
      <P>I am refusing a £20,000 annual income into my practice, just as Deputy McManus's husband would, because it is the GPs who will benefit from the scheme. All available funding for health services should be channelled into areas where it will directly affect those in need of treatment. The health strategy&mdash;</P>

Everything cannot be done at once and change will not happen overnight, but we have started something that has the potential for change. No one disputes that there is a need to bring low income young couples with children into the medical card system, but I dispute the figure of 250,000 and know the people who would benefit.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution. I welcome the publication of the excellent health strategy which provides a comprehensive programme to deal with our society's future health needs. It is the result of proper and full studies of the entire health service. We have the reports on medical manpower and junior hospital doctors' working practices, the commission on nursing, the strategic assessment of hospital capacity and the national consultative forum which facilitates the input of health stakeholders into the national health strategy. Through a progressive programme of research and negotiation, a quality, well founded strategy was developed, which will stand the test of time.</P>
      <P>We should bear in mind that Government spending on the health service has more than doubled since 1997. The biggest ever increase in hospital activity will occur this year. The total staffing figure for the public health service has increased from about 68,000 in 1997 to 86,000 today. There are 1,700 extra nurses in the health service. A record number of nursing students are training this year while the number of nurse training places is at an all time high of 1,640. I welcome the fact that the report of the commission on nursing is being implemented fully with major improvements in conditions and support for nursing staff.</P>
      <P>There is a major capital investment programme in my county, County Cavan. I am sure there are similar programmes in other counties. I thank the Ministers, Deputies Cowen and Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for their decision to allocate major funding to the North-Eastern Health Board to enable it to provide an operational 30 bed nursing unit and community health facility in Ballyconnell, a 50 bed nursing unit and health centre under construction in Virginia, a major health care unit under construction at Cootehill and major developments planned for Cavan General Hospital. These are the results of decisions made by the Ministers to provide a proper health infrastructure in rural Ireland. I am glad that these investment programmes are taking place because of the Government's good management of the economy and the provision of facilities for our health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beneath the Labour Party's rhetoric is the infamous insurance company health plan which would shut local hospitals. It would place an insurance company between the patient and the hospital bed. It is a system which has been repeatedly shown to increase funding for administration at patients' expense. Its policy document clearly states that &ldquo;public and voluntary hospitals will be <Col N="911" /> required to cover their operating costs through income from health insurers and patient co-payments where applicable.&rdquo; This would mean, in effect, that smaller hospitals which could not win service contracts from private health insurers may have to close or, at least, cut their level of service. A year on the Labour Party relaunched the document and again conceded that smaller local hospitals, which could not provide cheap services could &ldquo;find themselves excluded from insurers lists of approved facilities.&rdquo; The vociferous call for reform from the Labour Party benches does not rest easy with the policy of hospital closure.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael initially dismissed entirely the Labour Party policy, but then changed its mind. In February 2000 its spokesperson, Deputy Shatter, stated, &ldquo;Whether the necessary reform can be brought about by the introduction of a universal health insurance system is questionable. What is needed is less, not more bureaucracy.&rdquo; All of us agree that we do not need more bureaucracy in the health service, yet in November 2000 Fine Gael, in its health plan for the nation, announced a consultative process in which the insurance company policy would be discussed.</P>
    <P>Beneath the Labour Party's rhetoric is a policy that would increase administration costs and shut local hospitals. Despite its opposition to the health strategy, in its pre-budget statement last Sunday, it makes no mention of health. Plainly, its focus is elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government, the Minister and Minister of State in particular, have devised a health strategy which is sound and will deliver the level of health service to which the people are entitled. It will deliver an additional 3,000 hospital beds &ndash; 650 next year. Rightly, by the end of 2002 no adult will wait more than 12 months for treatment and no child more than six. By the end of 2003 no adult will wait more than six months for treatment and no child more than three. By the end of 2004 no public patient will wait more than three months for treatment. These are achievable targets and a level of service to which people are entitled.</P>
    <P>During the years my health board, the North-Eastern Health Board, has bought in services from the North, which was beneficial for those awaiting hip and cataract procedures. I endorse the establishment of the treatment purchase fund. Wherever services are available, in the North, Britain or elsewhere, every effort should be made to buy them to ensure our patients are treated as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the publication of the health strategy, which is a new direction and states that medical cards will be extended to more families with children and people with disabilities being the priority. I welcome the emphasis on increasing bed numbers because we lost out on beds in the 1980s. In particular, I welcome progress in County Galway where, in recent weeks, the Mini<Col N="912" /> ster announced an allocation of £3 million for the Western Health Board to purchase the Bons Secours hospital, which will ensure Tuam has a community hospital. He also announced an allocation of £11 million to purchase Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe from the Sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood. Portiuncula Hospital has played a very important role in the provision of public hospital services in the region in the past 50 years under the stewardship of the order and it is important that it be retained as a provider of public hospital services, now that the order has decided to withdraw. The purchase of the hospital by the Western Health Board will ensure the acute hospital services will continue to be provided to the public at Portiuncula Hospital and it will facilitate the expansion and development of services in the future.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the sisters at Portiuncula and the Bon Secours sisters in Tuam for their dedication to caring for people and all their work over the years to provide hospital services for the people of the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said waiting lists are down substantially for the first half of 2001. There are also regional issues that the Minister should look at. There are a large number of people in the Western Health Board area who must travel outside the area to get medical treatment. The Government is committed to improvements in the west and I welcome the developments in University College Hospital in Galway concerning cancer and heart treatment. I have mentioned the new developments proposed for Tuam and Ballinasloe. I look forward to the day when patients from the west do not have to travel to the Mater Hospital, Beaumont or St. James's Hospital and can have treatment in their own region. I have often been told that patients from Galway cannot get treatment in Dublin because there is a shortage of beds and this must be addressed.</P>
      <P>An additional neurological centre is needed in the west. People with head injuries need treatment as quickly as possible and at present, they must go to Dublin or Cork. I urge the Government to support the effort to put this unit in place.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the statement by the Minister that a treatment purchase scheme will buy services from both public and private hospitals to meet targets for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004. I welcome the announcement that 800 adult community nursing beds per annum will be available over the next seven years. I urge the Government to support the many projects that involve the retirement villages planned throughout the country. In particular, I commend Dr. Cowley in County Mayo for his initiative. He has given a lead to other communities in rural areas and I thank him for his advice and help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the achievements of this Government is the extra funding for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. There are now extra residential respite and day places available. <Col N="913" /> The number of people with a disability in psychiatric hospitals has been reduced from 970 in 1996 to 571 now. I hope these new residential places will be as near to the people's homes as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope the Western Health Board will continue to support the Brothers of Charity and the Galway County Association for Children with a Disability so that they can continue their good work. The Minister, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, have been very pro-active in giving priority to people with disability.</P>
    <P>Death rates from coronary heart disease in Ireland are considerably higher than the EU average. I welcome the planned recruitment of 800 professionals throughout the community in the first two years of implementation. I congratulate the Minister on the measures he has introduced, both in prevention and rehabilitation. I wish the Government well with the new national health strategy.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy O'Flynn. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the debate on health tonight. I welcome the publication of the national health strategy by the Government. This motion was tabled by members of the Labour Party, despite the fact that during their time in the rainbow coalition the medical card eligibility was not increased significantly. Now they present themselves as the great advocates of the health service. They left it to us to give medical cards to all people over 70, to develop the health targets as part of the national anti-poverty strategy, to start the job of reform in the area of disability and they now speak about equality, access and reform as if they had ever done anything about these important areas.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, annual capital health spending is almost three times that of the previous Government. Our hospitals are treating more people than ever before. The past year alone has seen an extra 52,000 people treated in our hospitals, the largest ever increase in hospital activity. In the area of disability, we have turned the tide on the shameful trend of neglect. By the end of this year, we will have invested additional revenue and capital funding amounting to £205 million in services for people with either an intellectual disability or autism. Since 1997, more than £107 million in additional funding has been allocated for services to people with physical and sensory disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying all is rosy in the health service it is plainly not. However, the investment is being put into the service for the first time and this will deliver results. The new health strategy is a continuation of that process. Built on years of research and negotiation, it represents the path forward in health reform. There will be 3,000 new beds in the system, 650 of these in the first year. By the end of the second year, no adult will wait more than 12 months for treatment. By the end of 2003, no adult will wait longer than six months and by the end of year four, no public patient will be on a waiting list for more than three months. <Col N="914" /> Some people might say these are loose targets. However, when we went into Government we had four key tasks including restoring peace, and reducing tax and unemployment. We have delivered on these and we will deliver on the health strategy.</P>
    <P>Enormous effort has been put in by the Minister, Deputy Martin, his predecessor, Deputy Cowen and the Cabinet. In a number of years time, those of us who will be privileged enough to still be Members of these Houses will be able to say that the national health strategy put in place in 2001 was the beginning of the great new health service that we have.</P>

      <P>Thankfully, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, continued the policies of the previous Government, which was one of our Governments, and for the first time in the history of the State, a considerable amount of money was available to him. The Minister for Health in that Government, Deputy Noonan, had for the first time in seven years the funds to effect real reform and improvement in the health service, but the wealth was not spread among the poor and needy. The opportunity to reform the health service was not availed of. The total health spend over the life of that Government was a meagre £400 million. It failed to put money into cutting waiting lists. It failed to provide new nurse training places. It simply failed to fund the health service. Deputy Quinn has admitted that concerns about the future of the medical profession, particularly about the nursing profession, were communicated to him and that he was disappointed he had not put systems in place and had not dwelt more on the health system when he was Minister for Finance.</P>

The South Infirmary and the Mercy Hospital have done well. I was there deputising for the lord mayor yesterday when the Minister for Health and Children opened a new oncology unit. This is the kind of investment which I and the constituents I represent want. This is the kind of investment Fianna Fáil in Government has delivered and will continue to deliver under the <Col N="915" /> new health strategy.

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate tonight. I am beginning to wonder if some people are living in cloud cuckooland. While the health strategy announced by the Minister for Health and Children last week promised some improvements in the funding and delivery of health care, it did little to address the fundamental inequalities that characterise our health service. The two-tier system which condemns public patients to months and sometimes years of suffering, while private patients are given priority, remains firmly in place. Even if the increased spending which has been promised by the Minister takes place, we will still have a system which is one of the most inequitable in the developed world. We have a system with a nominally free hospital service, but the fear of public hospital waiting lists has driven almost 45% of the population into private health care.</P>
      <P>We still have a system which charges 70% of the population for GP visits and where people on low incomes pay a significant contribution to health spending in their payments to GPs and for medicines, while private health insurance contributes approximately 9% of all health spending. We still have a system whereby private care in public hospitals is heavily subsidised by the taxpayers, many of whom cannot afford to avail of such care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children must be aware that one in four voters puts health care at the top of the list of issues on which the next election should be fought. People throughout the country are asking why, at a time of extraordinary economic growth, many people are on waiting lists. These people are often in pain and many of them will suffer permanent impairment as a result <Col N="916" /> of delayed treatment. They are also asking why, at a time of rapidly increasing incomes and medical costs, the income limit for eligibility for medical cards is below the average industrial wage. At a time when our economic growth is said to create two new millionaires a week, why must some parents reduce their spending on food to pay for essential medical care for their children? Is the Minister aware that free and equitable health care is taken for granted in many developed countries?</P>
    <P>Despite being a long time in gestation, the health strategy is largely a series of <i>ad hoc </i>measures and quick fix solutions which the Government hopes will deflect the wrath of the electorate. There is no radical reappraisal of how our health care system can best be funded and organised to meet the needs of our increasing population. The strategy does not show any commitment to tackle the vested interests particularly of hospital consultants whose contacts give them an opportunity to use private beds in public hospitals. In Denmark, which has one of the best medical care systems in the EU, hospital consultants are paid less for their work in the public sector. Consultants in Denmark are remarkable because they oppose the extension of private medical care. It is hardly surprising that 90% of Danes are satisfied with their medical care system, which is the highest satisfaction rate in the EU.</P>
    <P>My family depended on a medical card which gave them access to medical services. Without it my family, like many others, would have had to make choices. Parents who need to go to a doctor might stay at home to provide the necessary finance to allow their children to go to the doctor. I am perplexed that someone who is diagnosed with cancer is put through the ringer to get a medical card. As soon as someone gets that news, a medical card should be provided immediately. Some of my family were in that situation. As someone who has lost aunts and uncles from asthma and bronchitis, I cannot understand why a humane society cannot provide medical cards to people with such illnesses. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, knows more about this than I do. People can die from such diseases. This area should be examined.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the health strategy which has not received much attention is health promotion. It appears from the Estimates that expenditure on health promotion might be reduced this year. The Minister is aware of the frightening level of consumption of alcohol, tobacco and narcotics by young people which will eventually lead to health problems. I am sure he is also aware that the fitness levels of school children are low compared to other EU countries. Many of us, including myself, eat unhealthy diets. More resources need to be devoted to health promotion to avoid huge increases in health care costs in the future. Finland, which once had a level of heart disease simi<Col N="917" /> lar to Ireland, has reduced it dramatically through effective health promotion.</P>
    <P>I remember reading about Aneurin Bevan and the opposition he encountered while setting up the NHS. In his memoirs he recalled getting a letter from an old woman in Lancashire who had worked in a cotton mill from the age of 12. She wrote to thank him for the spectacles she had received under the NHS which enabled her to write letters. She ended her letter with a prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, reform thy world beginning with me.&rdquo; I doubt if the Minister for Health and Children will get many such letters, but he should ponder the old woman's wish.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to the debate and it is interesting to hear some of the speakers on the Government side. I do not know what is happening in other health board areas, such as Donegal and Cork, but the contributions do not reflect what is happening in the north-east region. I was surprised at Deputy Brendan Smith's contribution. The situation is completely and utterly different from what Government speakers stated here tonight. There are empty wards and beds in every hospital in the north-east region. There is a lack of nurses and medical staff at every level. As a qualified GP, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, should know that better than anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only happening in Drogheda and Dundalk, but in every town throughout the country. Beds are lying idle, while people are lying on trolleys in the corridors and in emergency beds in waiting areas for hours. If one was to take the non-EU staff out of the hospitals in my area, they would fold up overnight. Most of the staff are non-EU citizens and Asians who had to be brought in because people will not work in the health services as they have lost confidence in the Government and its health policy. One has only to look at the national newspapers every day, particularly at weekends, to see the hundreds and thousands of pounds being spent trying to get consultants and nursing staff. Various incentives are being thought up to entice them into the health service. It is not possible to get nurses to accept jobs in Dublin. I know nurses from my own town who gave up nursing and are now working in Dublin in other professions because they were not paid enough for the hours they worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orthodontic treatment in the north-east region is non-existent. Perhaps the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, will tell me how many are on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment in Donegal. I am sure the position is as bad there as it is in County Louth &ndash; if it is not, there is something wrong. I cannot get <Col N="918" /> any positive response from the North-Eastern Health Board about orthodontic treatment. People must go from Drogheda, Dundalk and elsewhere in County Louth to Newry and other parts of Northern Ireland where they must pay more than £3,000 in some cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that because he lives in the Border area, like I do. People cannot get treatment because they cannot afford to pay for it. It is cheaper in Northern Ireland. People are borrowing money from the credit union on a never-never basis to have their children's teeth treated. The waiting list is miles long &ndash; it would stretch from Drogheda to Dundalk. I cannot understand people saying there is not a problem with waiting lists. Another area of concern is hip replacements. How long does it take for someone to get a hip replacement operation? There is one unit in Navan which does a good job, but it cannot cope with the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The man who made the biggest contribution to the health services in my area was Deputy Howlin. He saved the North-Eastern Health Board and other health boards from bankruptcy by giving them a substantial cash injection to wipe out the deficits. He put proper health policies in place in each of the health board areas. Instead of that position improving when we had the cash, it has got much worse. The biggest problem we had to deal with in our clinics used to be people having to wait two years to get a telephone. Thankfully that is no longer the case. Subsequently it was unemployment, but any Member of this House will tell the Government, quite openly, that the biggest issues we face in our clinics now are health related. They are in the North-Eastern Health Board area. The main issue relates to medical cards. The system is an absolute disgrace. People are coming into my clinics crying. There are women who cannot go to the doctor because they cannot afford to pay the fee or for the prescriptions. Some of these women are paying £5 a week on the &ldquo;never never&rdquo; so that they can get a prescription when one of the family gets sick. In my town people are paying £5 per week to the doctor and getting a receipt for it every week because they cannot afford to pay the bills. If we could only admit that there is a serious problem, we could do something about it. This is the most outrageous decision of all, because it hurts the most vulnerable in our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, Deputy Brian Lenihan and other Members on the Fianna Fáil benches, throw at us on the other side of the House what happened when other Governments were in office. That is extraordinary, coming from Fianna Fáil, a party that has been in Government for 12 of the past 14 years. Its <Col N="919" /> members seem to have forgotten that the man they lionised, former Deputy Ray MacSharry, is directly responsible for the gap that has to be made up in the health services. I do not know why they want to look to this side of the House for explanations when the fact is that we now have wealth which we did not have when Ray MacSharry was Minister. Is this the way to use that wealth?</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy O'Flynn talking about the bad years and he looks like a man who weathered them reasonably well. The health services in Cork are in fine fettle according to him, but that is unknown to us in the rest of the House. It is remarkable how quickly this Government has grown remote from the people as evidenced by the Minister for Health and Children slipping on a banana skin of this size. Even the Minister's most ardent and well-placed supporters &ndash; we have seen some in recent days &ndash; are taken aback by his blunder on medical card eligibility limits. This was the immediate acid test of his eleventh hour health strategy. Fine rhetoric for reform and promises of what will happen when the Minister is no longer in office are all very well, but what about the here and now? There is, after all, a general election around the corner and we all remember the surprise expressed by the Taoiseach's mentor, Mr. Haughey, when he went to meet the people in 1989.</P>
      <P>The present health strategy is an attempt by this Government to retaliate first. The media &ndash; and thus the public &ndash; was generally well disposed, even if the end of a term of office is an unusual time to promulgate a health strategy. The test must be what actual reforms this Government implements in the time left to it. Enhanced eligibility for medical cards would have been a practical reform on the way to a free GP service. Given the extent to which our health services are characterised by inequality, extending the medical card scheme would at least acknowledge the core problem. The Minister purports to acknowledge that reform of the primary care system will help contain the pressure on acute hospitals, but he has blown it. He managed to persuade the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to ignore the publication of a glossy document underpinned by notional billions for the future, but he could not manage to persuade Deputy McCreevy to approve a small step to tackle an inequality that causes so much hardship. This calculated rejection of poor people is perfectly consistent coming from this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything this Government has touched in four and a half years has widened the gap between the very well off and those struggling to make ends meet. The IMO has said that the Minister's decision will &ldquo;undermine the Minister's own health strategy's guiding principles&rdquo;. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has pointed out that more families on the minimum wage are &ldquo;turning to the Society for money for doctor's bills and for medication&rdquo;. Professor Tom <Col N="920" /> O'Dowd, who has carried out studies in my constituency and is based in the Mary Mercer Health Centre in Jobstown, has noted that 25% of male patients in their fifties were &ldquo;putting off going to see the doctor because of the cost&rdquo;. In his professional view this is a very vulnerable group with a high risk of cardiac failure. I do not say this Minister's failure with regard to medical cards sets his health strategy at nought. I, along with his party's backbenchers and many groups outside this House, say that the credibility to be attached to the health strategy is greatly diminished. For thousands of poor people it is more serious than that. People on low wages in indifferent health must continue to pay to visit their GPs or else go without and it is an intolerable disgrace if that is to be the legacy of this Government at the end of the boom. I note that if this motion is to be carried tonight it will depend on the votes of the likes of Deputy Healy-Rae, whom I notice is quoted in a south Kerry local newspaper to the effect that he does not need to come in here and vote and make loud speeches. All he has to do is go to the office of the Chief Whip where he will meet the Minister for Health and Children and get bags of medical cards. It would be much better if Deputy Healy-Rae came in here tonight and voted to support this motion and to share the bag of medical cards with the rest of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are spending three hours talking about something which is very simple. It is about the right of access to basic primary health care. It is extraordinary that this issue has not been prioritised by a Government that has so much money and that we are only getting its health strategy on the eve of a general election. The Government is totally out of step with the people. It does not recognise that the right to access primary care should be an absolute priority. If one does not have access to basic primary care, what rights does one have in health care? What would we say if somebody did not have a right to basic primary education?</P>
      <P>The issue of health has been left to be dealt with later. What is being said is that a couple with two children and who are earning less than £200 per week do not have the right to go to their GP. They have to make a choice. When their child is sick they have to think about whether they can afford to go to a GP based on how sick the child is. They have to decide if they can wait to see if the child gets better or grows worse or if that is too great a risk to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are living in a wealthy economy and have the money to spend on this most basic of problems. This is something that will come back to haunt this Government. Given that billions of pounds have been discussed in regard to this health strategy and its complications over the past week, this is the simplest of issues. It is <Col N="921" /> the one that should have been concentrated on. It is extraordinary to hear Deputy McDaid implying that the strenuous opposition of the IMO to the Government's proposal might be motivated by self interest. That seemed to be what he implied when he said the money would go into the pockets of the GPs. The IMO strenuously objected to the decision that was made. Is the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation suggesting that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul might be motivated by self interest in its opposition to the Government's decision? I have sat and listened for approximately an hour to the bombast that has come from the Government side of the House. No attention has been paid to the issue that we have put on the table which is one of access and civil rights for every citizen. What is at issue is the right to have health care needs addressed when a person is sick. The Government will have to go back and look at the decision it has made.</P>
      <P>I will make an economic argument which might reach the ears of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. If I were a working person on such an income, I would ask the reason I was working and if I would not be much better off if I had my medical card and did not have my job. That is a genuine economic argument which might be of interest to the Minister because he does not appear to respond to the human stories behind the widespread opposition to this decision.</P>
      <P>I will give one human story which I heard this morning. I spoke with an elderly person over 70 years who qualified for a medical card this year. She said she would have much preferred to see her grandchild receive the card because they did not have access to one. She had seen the mother of the child having to decide whether to balance the household budget or take the child to the doctor. That is how basic this issue is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has the best interests of patients and the people at heart and that he would like to be the Minister who set down a landmark strategy which ensured a health culture was brought about where health bills were reduced and those in need of medical attention received it. This ten year strategy with a price tag of £10 billion was presented with a veneer of competence. The reality of its implementation is far removed from the slick public relations we witnessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every one of past ten general elections in which I have participated there has been a major blunder by the Government in office before the election. I recall the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, admitting he did not know the position of haemophiliacs was as serious as it was, the late former Minister Boland saying prescriptions would not be issued from rural pharmacies, and the former Minister for Education and Science, Gemma Hussey, proposing to remove school transport from medical card holders. In each of <Col N="922" /> these campaigns, despite overall figures being shown to be for the good of the country, the issue people understood became the one close to their hearts.</P>
    <P>After presenting what is a worthwhile document in many respects and following with a worthwhile document in the context of a community network of care, to follow with a major blunder of excluding 200,000 people from the general medical service scheme who would be eligible next year, while not the Minister's fault, is an indication of how the Government feels about the people. The slogan in the previous election was &ldquo;People before politics.&rdquo; It appears to be reversed now.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from a woman in my town who must wait two years for a tonsillectomy. Her neighbour has a daughter who has blackouts and been assessed as not having epilepsy but who must wait six months for a brain scan in Beaumont Hospital.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been misinformation on the guidelines for medical card holders. If one is a single person under 66 years, living alone and earning more than £100, one cannot get a medical card. If one is a single person living with one's family, the threshold is £89. It is £144.50 for married couples under 66 years of age. This rules out anyone who is working or on a low income. As a result, the people concerned cannot avail of the services of a doctor. Minor ailments can become serious and lead to death because people cannot go to a doctor because they do not have the money in their pockets. Doctors are not charitable organisations. The people concerned might go once or twice because the doctor might be kind to them, but they cannot afford to go generally. The health service is not coping with the needs of the underprivileged. Our health status is not what it would be if a proper health service was available and there was proper access to primary care services which the current system does not allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a number of Members on the Government side defending the Minister's record on waiting lists. The chief executive of the Southern Health Board announced today that the out-patient waiting list in Tralee General Hospital had been reduced from 5,173 to 3,790. He said that was as a result of verification of the waiting list. Many of those on the waiting list for five years or more were dead. I know this because they were called for procedures and were found to be dead. <Col N="923" /> Others on the list had made other arrangements for treatment. There was an attempt to deceive the people by saying this was a decrease in the numbers on the out-patient waiting list. It is misleading the public and the Minister should correct it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is patently obvious that the long delay in producing the Government health strategy had nothing to do with the extent of the work involved, rather it had everything to do with the fact that there was no clear leadership and no direction at Cabinet as to how to put right our grossly inequitable health system. The Taoiseach let the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance fight it out. We are on the side of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The health strategy was unveiled with great fanfare and the Government then told us it would not take the one vital short-term action needed, namely, to extend medical card eligibility. Nothing is to be done on medical cards in the remaining term of the Government. We are told the planned extension will not begin until 2003, budgetary considerations permitting.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, won the argument. That is the reality, plain and simple. He has once again had his way. More significantly, the Taoiseach did not take the lead and ensure action was taken in tomorrow's budget to help those most in need in our health system. We have heard the initial extension of medical cards to 200,000 people would have cost £80 million. In 2001, the Minister for Finance reduced corporation tax at a cost of £214 million. That shows the priorities of the Government. The profit margins of big business come before the needs of families who cannot afford to bring their children to the doctor or buy essential medication because they are denied a medical card.</P>
      <P>I call for the immediate extension of medical card eligibility to all under 18 years, to all on or below the minimum wage, and to all with disabilities or conditions such as asthma which necessitate expensive ongoing medication. My brother has Down's syndrome and long held a medical card, but I was shocked to learn recently at a meeting of the North-Eastern Health Board that there are many others with the same or similar intellectual disabilities who do not qualify.

      <P>Nowhere is that clearer than in my area of responsibility, which has not been mentioned in the debate, involving the welfare of the most vulnerable children. The Government has not only set out the philosophy and policy which guides its thinking, but has also backed it up through legislation, supported it with investment and is delivering it through new structures. Major policies and guidelines have been set down for the protection of our children, which were not there before. These include the national children's strategy, the homeless strategy, which aims to reduce and eliminate homelessness, and the children first guidelines for the identification and reporting of abuse.</P>
      <P>No one, either inside or outside the House, can say that real progress has not been made in this area. Policies and philosophies which are backed up by legislation are changing the focus of how we deal with children in these circumstances. This is particularly the case with the Children Act, which we have started to implement. The focus has changed from locking up children to ensuring that detention is used only as a last resort. More importantly, this has been backed by investment in recent years, with over £90 million extra being spent on these children.</P>

      <P>It also provides residential care for the most vulnerable children because where formerly there were 17 special care places there are now 88.

      <P>The promise that 200,000 extra people were to receive medical cards in 2002 was welcome news indeed. It was a great Christmas present for many low income families, or so it seemed. After last Wednesday's shocking announcement, however, Christmas now appears much bleaker for 200,000 people. The announcement has hit the most vulnerable in society at the most difficult time of year. How can the Minister defend his position to a single mother who wakes up to hear her child crying in pain at 3 o'clock in the morning, but who cannot afford to call out a doctor because it would cost £40 or £50 to do so? How will the Minister explain his decision to an old age pensioner couple who, with an income from the State of £185 per week, do not qualify for a medical card? The guidelines dictate that such a couple can only earn £162 per week to qualify for the medical card scheme. Medical costs for such an elderly couple can be considerable, yet they are a miserable £23 over the limit for medical card eligibility.</P>
      <P>Another example of the people who will be penalised by this appalling decision is a married couple with one child and an income equivalent to the minimum wage. All that couple can earn to qualify for a medical card is £162 per week. If their income exceeds that amount by a mere £10 or £12 they will not qualify for a medical card. They can appeal the decision but will be forced to jump through a series of hoops to get what is a basic requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could cite numerous examples of those who will fall victim to the harsh decisions of the Government in the year ahead. Last week, the <Col N="927" /> Minister's paltry excuse was that he had to prioritise his health policy for the coming year. The Minister has a strange sense of priorities if he is telling us that old age pensioners or a married couple on low income represent a lower priority than a national stadium.</P>
    <P>The Independent TDs who support the Government have much explaining to do to their constituents. They have been trying to limit the damage caused by this decision on the plinth all day, sending out conflicting signals about the extension of the medical card scheme. The Government's amendment to our motion, however, only says that it is committed to extending the medical card scheme to 200,000. Crucially, though, it does not say when it will do this. For that reason, the Government amendment must be defeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This important topic affects some of the poorest people in my constituency who often attend my advice centres in conditions of great stress. The view of the Minister, Deputy McDaid that 80% of those who might qualify if the medical card scheme was extended would never use it illustrates the fundamental distinction between our viewpoints on health. The issue is not whether one would use the scheme, but having the social protection it affords. There is an enormous difference between two things that divide us in the House. One is the restructuring of the sickness industry, which will welcome private money into what might be regarded as highly profitable activities that are now tax assisted and subsidised by the public purse for private gain &ndash; the sickness industry is yielding profit. The other is the health service with a set of guarantees.</P>
      <P>When the history of the past five years comes to be written, the question will be asked what people said, or failed to say, about the health service. Claiming credit, often where it was not due, mention was made of the fact that we have the highest growth in the European Union. Many Ministers mentioned that, but few said that over this period of extraordinary wealth we were in the bottom two or three countries concerning social protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a miserable record in providing social protection for women, for example, who may be under great stress due to high rent, low income and many other problems. The rising cost of housing has had a major influence in the past five years. Rents have escalated while people have had to live in poor social housing conditions. The last straw for such people is when somebody becomes ill. There is nowhere for them to go because they cannot afford to be ill. The guaranteed social protection of the medial card, of its nature, addresses rights to health care. There are many good proposals in the health strategy with which I agree and some proposals for reform but I wonder how they came to gestation just six months before the election. Leaving that aside the fundamental question is what quality of social <Col N="928" /> protection is available to citizens? That is what a health system is about. The stress is not even at the time of illness. At advice centres, one case after another &ndash; all Deputies on the other side know this &ndash; the question is what happens if one of us gets sick. It is the last straw that pushes people in poverty below the floor of poverty altogether. That is what this motion is about. It would cost £80 million to remove 200,000 of the most vulnerable citizens from such a situation.  When the history comes to be written people will know that £80 million was not available in the best of times with the greatest surpluses. There is no need to go back over history about who did what. The question will be put this way: when the economy turned who had to wait? I can say who had to wait. In relation to the housing crisis, which I mentioned earlier, the landlords did not have to wait but the tenants had to wait. The tenants were told they would get their protection in 2002 but the landlords were looked after. In this case the 200,000 people have to wait until 2003 and even then there is no guarantee, it is conditional on what Government revenues will allow.</P>
    <P>What always struck me at advice centres was that there are parents who would sacrifice anything for their children. The greatest stress that faced them was the possibility of not being able to bring their child to a doctor. There is another side to this as well. All the evidence of a socio-medical kind indicates that a visit deferred is putting the person at risk, that it would be more costly for the person in terms of their life and more costly for the State in relation to later care. Who has to wait and why? Those who have to wait have to do so because they have not been accorded the priority that an egalitarian approach would accord them. They are entitled by right to a health service. I have listened to all the speeches this evening. The fundamental difference is that on one side of the House, the Government says they will get it when the Government can afford to give it while people on this side talk about an extension of rights, the right to social protection, good health care and the right in a citizenship count.</P>
    <P>I will say a word about what I believe to be the kind of degradation of politics that unfortunately is not sufficiently commented upon in this House. That is the suggestion that the medical card has a pre-history which goes back to the old blue card and the time when a person would get the notable in the parish who represented him on the board of guardians of the grand jury to put in a word for him for a blue card. That is what Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae reminds me of. He will not come into the House to speak of the right of every citizen to have a medical card but he will go to the Chief Whip's office where he can meet the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children and get whatever he likes. That is the kind of statement about behaviour that has degraded politics. I hope the public will have an opportunity soon to express their opinion on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> I knew people who put the health system before the sickness industry. I knew people such as the late Dr. Paddy Leahy and others who looked at people and saw what they needed and were willing to fight publicly for it. I feel like that about what is happening this evening. Deputy Lenihan argued that a person can get his rights when everything else is in place. Speaking about medical cards for 200,000 people is playing a cheap political game. It is about when the economy turns and those who are asked to wait. It is not speculators in housing who will have to wait but tenants, not those who will invest and make money out of the sickness industry but the 200,000 who might have got medical cards that would have given them some social protection. That is why the motion is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party Deputies who contributed to this debate and the Members of the Opposition who supported the motion. I listened with interest to Government Deputies who contributed and I was reminded of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> because it appeared that the one message to the people in need was that they could have had the medical card yesterday, maybe they will get it tomorrow but they should not expect it today. It is worth reminding the Government that a promise was made and commitments were indicated in the run up to the health strategy that were dashed when the Minister for Health and Children announced that far from the expectation being realised there would be no granting of medical cards for 200,000 people in 2002. Is it any wonder that organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul were appalled and shocked when that news became known and expressed their views so forcefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is dispiriting that a once great party like Fianna Fáil should be so out of touch with the needs of ordinary working people. That was not always the case. Ordinary working people, many of whom voted for Fianna Fáil at the last election, believed in the slogan &ldquo;people before politics&rdquo;. When Fianna Fáil was elected to Government the same people believed the Government when it said it would tackle the hospital waiting lists. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats poured money into hospital waiting lists but the numbers have not reduced significantly. There are 26,000 approximately on hospital waiting lists <Col N="930" /> after millions of pounds have been squandered in trying to tackle a problem that requires structural reform, if it is ever to be tackled. Some 200,000 people thought matters would get better for them in the same way that they have got so much better in the country generally, particularly for the better off.</P>
    <P>We have seen a growing disparity between rich and poor. If one is very poor and on social welfare one has a medical card. For those whose income just exceeds the limit, life is still a struggle. Parents are worried that maybe a child will get sick and that they may have to call out the doctor. Even if they can afford to pay for the doctor how in God's name will they pay for the medication? That the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, should say 80% of these people would not need or use a medical card is extraordinary coming from a man who is surely better able to understand what happens in society. When one is living on a low income one runs a far greater risk of experiencing sickness. You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would understand that the better off in society live longer and generally have healthier lives and that those on low incomes suffer to a greater degree from ill health and stress. One can imagine how much greater the stress levels when one is worried about whether one can afford to pay the doctor. This is a simple measure and one that would have transformed the lives of thousands of people in terms of providing security and freedom from worry for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>I urge the Fianna Fáil Deputies, quite apart from the Independent Deputies, who know what I am saying is right, to ensure this is done. This is the legacy that should be left by the Minister for Health and Children who so far in his career has only increased the divide in the health service and introduced a new inequality where it did not exist previously. He has provided medical cards for people who are relatively well off and who happen to be over 70 and is denying medical cards to people on low incomes who simply cannot get a doctor and medication when needed. I urge the Independent Deputies to come in here tonight and defend the interests of poor people who cannot have that entitlement unless they make a decision now to support these thousands of people.</P>

      <P>Foxtec Ireland Limited opened in Mullingar in June 1999 with tremendous publicity. It was promised at that stage that 500 jobs would be created in Mullingar. We were all of the opinion that this would happen because Foxtec Ireland Limited was a subsidiary of the famous Hon Hai Precision Company of Taiwan. It was the first major Taiwanese investment in Ireland and great pomp and revelry accompanied the announcement. It is a major company, which is quoted on the Taiwanese stock exchange, and it was considered that Foxtec would be a major addition to Mullingar. The company was involved in the computer business and produced goods for the PC industry. Some of the companies it supplied included Dell and Apple. Up to 160 jobs were established at one stage, but, unfortunately, there was an announcement recently that Foxtec would close. There are currently 119 employees and we heard about the proposed closure with great sadness.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for any of us to appreciate what it must be like to lose one's job. The Foxtec work force was dominated by women, some of whom had returned to the work force having reared their families. It was relatively easy to get employment there and shift work that suited family life was available. I am particularly sad for those workers. They made a tremendous effort to get back into the work force and they are now being turfed out of their jobs. It will also be a huge blow to their families because the women's economic input was most important. The closure is particularly sad for them given that it is the run up to Christmas.</P>
      <P>It is important that a reasonable redundancy package is negotiated for the workers. I hope the Minister will be able to ensure that a reasonable package is put together for them. Some of those employed by an agency to do contract work in Foxtec have already been fixed up and that is great news for the small number of people involved. However, I hope something can be done for the other workers in Foxtec.</P>
      <P>It is the third closure in Mullingar since 1988, which is very sad. Oxford Health Plans closed but, thankfully, it was replaced by GMAC relatively quickly. Tarkett also closed with the loss of more than 200 jobs. That was replaced by Foxtec which is now gone. This is sad for the people who worked there and it is bad for the economic base of the Mullingar area. Some 500 jobs have been lost in Westmeath in recent months, including in William Hill in Athlone, Foxtec in Mullingar, Ericsson's in Mullingar, Mallinckroyd in Athlone and Genesis in Mullingar. It is a sad litany. I ask the Government to establish a task force to try to find replacement industries. I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that such a task force will be set up in the hope of finding replacement jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to share my time with my constituency colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who obviously is also concerned about this matter. Christmas is a particularly poignant time for families and the recent announcement by Foxtec Ireland Limited that it will close its factory with the loss of 119 jobs and that manufacturing operations will cease at the end of December dampened the usual joyous feeling associated with this time of year.</P>
      <P>Foxtec has operated in Mullingar Business Park for more than two years. It was widely greeted as a partial replacement for the Tarkett factory, the closure of which was a body blow for employment in the region. Over the past two months, prior to the announcement of the closure of this important source of employment, there were persistent rumours that there would be lay-offs and that there was the possibility of closure. The announcement of the closure was one of seismic proportions, as it impacts not only on the employees but also on the wider community and the economic environment. When we think of the 119 employees we cannot but comprehend the human dimension to this announcement.</P>
      <P>Many of the people concerned are married and have families of varying ages. For some, their job with Foxtec was the only source of income to help pay mortgages, loans and other financial commitments. Others workers included a number of women who had availed of the opportunity to return to the workforce and were delighted to have an opportunity to augment their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of the plant is a major blow for each and every worker. There were a number of <Col N="937" /> couples who earned the household income in this factory. One woman had six family members working in the company. It is widely known that for every job lost in a company of this magnitude about four people are directly affected, which means up to 500 people are paying the price for the closure of Foxtec.</P>
    <P>We should recall that the closure of Foxtec is just one of a number of job losses experienced by workers across County Westmeath in the past two months or so. In October we had to raise the issue in the Dáil of the announcement by William Hill that it intended to close its call centre operation in Athlone with the loss of up to 300 jobs. In mid-November there were a number of employees laid off at Genesis Fine Arts and there have also been a number of redundancies at Ericsson in Athlone.</P>
    <P>A factory of this nature and size generates many ancillary downstream jobs in sectors such as maintenance, haulage, contract cleaning and catering. An announcement of this nature in the run-up to Christmas is particularly poignant. This factory has employees not only from Mullingar town but also from Delvin, Ballynacargy, the Downs and Milltown and from as far away as Tullamore.</P>
    <P>Now we must look to the future. There is a huge facility available, located centrally and with an excellent rail and road network available which means it is within one hour of Dublin and easy reach of our airports and seaports. There are excellent infrastructural facilities in close proximity. The town is an excellent location with a well developed infrastructure located in the Dublin corridor and boasting a highly skilled and educated workforce with a proven track record.</P>
    <P>I am requesting the Minister to establish a task force comprising an inter-agency group to formulate an adequate response to the closure of Foxtec, and set about securing alternative job creating enterprises both from overseas and the indigenous sector. The factory is located in the BMW region and we expect IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to act immediately to secure new industries to locate in both Mullingar and Athlone to replace the significant number of jobs lost in both these major towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for raising this matter and the time afforded to me. I join them in raising the issue. I am speaking from the Government benches. I am a Cabinet Minister and proud and pleased about the record of employment created by the Government, in particular, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Tom Kitt and Noel Treacy, but share the worry and concern which the closure of Foxtec has engendered within the wider Mullingar area. I know quite well that <Col N="938" /> being told that people's jobs are to disappear in a short length of time has a traumatic effect on the workers, their families and the wider community in which they live and their money is spent.</P>
      <P>Regarding the closures mentioned in Athlone, William Hill closed because the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, MP, lifted the betting tax overnight and thus took away the advantage enjoyed by William Hill in establishing here. However, the IDA is working with all its might and mien to get a call centre to take over the existing facility lock, stock and barrel. I hope that will happen.</P>
      <P>Equally, on the small number of redundancies at Ericsson, the company has given good quality employment in the town and provided social benefits for all its workers. I hope the upturn in the technology sector when it comes will enable the company to emerge again as the powerful force it is in Athlone's commercial life.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputies' disappointment on the closure of Foxtec and know my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, does too. For a plant which opened less than two years ago to roll down its shutters and close is a huge disappointment for Mullingar, for the wider area to which Deputy Penrose referred and for all who watch the commercial life of County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister and the Minister of State will be looking, as they have done in recent months, at how an inter-agency operation can help. In fact, Deputy McGrath cited the equation, that when one firm closed another opened immediately in the same premises. In that way, Tarkett was replaced by Foxtec.</P>
      <P>The rest of all that, however, is the sad closure of Foxtec. We all remember the fine day we met there and the hopes we had for the future which have not been realised. I am sure, however, that the downturn will be followed by an upturn. That said, I will be speaking with my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, the Minister, Deputy Harney, and Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to ensure a replacement industry is found for the Foxtec plant as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Penrose and McGrath and my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for raising this subject tonight. The fact that three Deputies from the constituency spoke on the matter indicates its importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share fully their concern and disappointment over the recent decision by Foxtec Engineering (Ireland) Limited to cease production at its Mullingar facility with the loss of 124 jobs. This company is a subsidiary of Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Limited, trading as &lsquo;Foxconn' Taipei, Taiwan &ndash; a global leader in mechanical <Col N="939" /> solutions for the computer industry. It is the largest manufacturer of connectors for use in personal computers in Taiwan and a leading manufacturer of connectors and cable assemblies in the world. The company also manufactures enclosures, primarily for desktop PCs and PC servers.</P>
    <P>I understand the parent company has made a decision to move its Irish production to China where labour costs are significantly cheaper, efficiencies are similar and the parent company has the capacity and modern equipment to supply customer needs. Assembly is a significant element of the process in Mullingar. The company closed an operation in the USA in July, supplying the same product and transferred manufacture to China.</P>
    <P>Of the 124 people currently employed at the Mullingar facility, it will let go 15 moulding operatives in mid-December 2001, 90 assembly employees by the end of December and the remaining 19 administration, warehousing and maintenance staff by the end of February 2002.</P>
    <P>Both the regional director and senior placement services officer of the FÁS midlands region met Foxtec Engineering (Ireland) Limited on 22 November 2001 to discuss the full range of support services it could offer the employees, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses.</P>
    <P>Recent positive developments in Mullingar include the announcement in January 2000 of the GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation project which has located in the Clonmore facility previously occupied by Oxford Health Plans. The project will operate a full commercial mortgage administration service and create 210 jobs. Currently it employs 94 people.</P>
    <P>The expansion of Iralco in Collinstown, County Westmeath, manufacturer of decorative and functional trim for the automotive industry, was also announced in January 2000. The company has exceeded initial employment targets, employing 655 people to date. Further expansion is planned.</P>
    <P>Other significant employers located in Mullingar are Penn Racquet Sports Limited employing 138 people and Taconic International employing 123.</P>
    <P>The IDA, in recognising the need and importance of securing additional land in the Mullingar area, completed the purchase of a 68 acre site on the Mullingar bypass. Consultants have been appointed to develop the master plan for the proposed IDA Mullingar business and technology park on the site. Plans for 100,000 sq. ft. of state-of-the-art buildings will also be developed.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is committed to securing 50% of all new greenfield jobs for the Border, midlands and western region, of which Mullingar is part. <Col N="940" /> This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions. In an effort to ensure the objective will be achieved, IDA Ireland initially reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices and allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its HQ project divisions.</P>
    <P>Up to one third of all IDA staff will now be based in the regions. The purpose of these moves is to drive growth from within the regions. Other initiatives include a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions. IDA Ireland's incentive package is strongly geared in favour of the Objective One regions which is in line with the new EU state aid limits.</P>
    <P>In all, IDA Ireland will have 95 staff across all its regional offices. The underlying purpose is to work in close partnership with the other State and local resources to create a drive from within the regions to pull foreign investment rather than the present approach of pushing for it from its Dublin headquarters.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is working closely with its client companies and regional partners in developing and sustaining businesses in the area, enhancing the business environment, encouraging new start-up companies with strong growth potential and assisting Dublin based companies to locate their business expansions in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>The full services of the agencies of my Department are available to respond to job losses and, in particular, to find alternative opportunities for workers affected by redundancies. FÁS is playing a very important role in both assessing and providing training and retraining for workers and has been very active in the midlands region. I am confident that the strenuous efforts being made by the development agencies will yield positive results on the industrial front for Mullingar and do not propose to establish a task force at this time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter. What are the prospects, if any, for the numerous schools which have made applications for new school buildings and refurbishment of old buildings? The same old story applies to each one. I put down three parliamentary questions today for written reply concerning three other schools in my constituency. I am sure that each reply will be identical to the reply the Minister will give tonight because the wording of each was identical. That is not on. The people concerned are very fed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Summercove national school in Kinsale is in a very bad condition. The board of management <Col N="941" /> made a request for a new school to be built about eight years ago and nothing has been done to tackle the problems. The school has 164 pupils. The yard and outdoor facilities are seriously substandard. This yard can only cope with about 40 pupils, not 164. One of the prefabs has no toilet facilities. There are potentially dangerous overhead power lines. There are no fire doors, fire escapes, smoke alarms, fire alarms or burglar alarms. The floor is in a very unsafe condition. None of the classrooms has two exits. There is evidence of vermin in the school. There are rotting windows, doors and fascias and evidence of damp, mildew and woodworm. Toilet facilities for staff and pupils are inadequate and there are no toilets for disabled persons. Hand washing and drying facilities are also inadequate and there is no hot or cold water. There is no principal's office, no staff room, no medical room, no library, no multi-purpose room or computer room.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no access for disabled persons. There are no children's or staff lockers, no car parking area or bus turning bay and no storage place. General lighting standards are inadequate and the plumbing and wiring systems are substandard. The roof is also substandard and is in danger of collapsing. The plaster work is falling off the walls. The drainage system is substandard. The school grounds and gardens are inadequate. The entrance gates and the shelter are falling down. How can the Minister stand over such a litany of works needed in that school? A new school is the only answer.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will say there is no architectural report available yet for the school's application. What has happened over the past four years with our rampant, roaring tiger? There was money to burn, yet nothing has been done for school buildings. The national school system is a disgrace. Some of the schools are not fit for human habitation. I am sorry the Minister for Education and Science and his junior Ministers are not here tonight to hear my complaint on behalf of the schools in south-west Cork. All our representations over the years have fallen on deaf ears. I want action tonight on behalf of Summercove national school in Kinsale and the other schools in my constituency which have been shown, in a recent survey carried out by the INTO, to be unfit for human habitation and unfit for the scholars who attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make one last appeal to the Minister. He should, for God's sake, try to do something to alleviate the problem. It is no good for him to tell me that architectural planning is at fault when there is no will and no way in his Department to build the schools. The Minister is using delaying tactics. I call on him to heed my request on behalf <Col N="942" /> of the pupils of Kinsale and other schools in west Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department regarding the proposed building project for Summercove national school. The picture painted by the Deputy of the conditions there gives us all cause for concern. At present, the school is staffed by a principal, four mainstream classroom teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The school's present facilities consist of two permanent classrooms, three prefabricated classrooms, one staff room, pupil and staff toilets, pupil cloakrooms and a small external store room. The school authorities have applied to the Department of Education and Science for grant aid towards the provision of additional permanent accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the facts as given to me by the Minister. This level of funding has enabled the Department to undertake a record number of building projects and it is the Minister's intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising over years past and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress of construction of individual projects, including a proposed building project at Summercove national school which has not yet commenced architectural planning, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>That is the up-to-date position. I will certainly convey the strong views presented by Deputy Sheehan to the Minister. The picture presented is cause for concern and I am speaking as somebody who worked as a teacher for several years before I entered this House.</P>

      <P>I and Deputy Fox wish to share time with Deputies Timmins and D'Arcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for discussion. Scrapie has been described as an age old disease and since 1992 it has been a notifiable disease. Random testing was commenced in 1998. In the autumn of this year there was grave concern expressed about what looked like a very negative report from the British authorities. It was widely rumoured at the time that the report would link scrapie and BSE. In October a statutory instrument was signed into law and the following Monday inspectors from the veterinary section of the Department served section A restriction orders on specified farmers in a number of counties. In all, 35 flocks have been locked up since those notices were issued, five of them in the constituency shared by me and Deputy Fox and 16 in Wexford.</P>
    <P>In the middle of October the IFA met officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the process of negotiations about how the crisis would be dealt with got under way, with particular reference to farmers whose flocks were locked up. Two days after these discussions commenced the news broke, to everybody's surprise, that the UK research report had been discredited. A fundamental error in the science had occurred and the report was effectively useless.</P>
    <P>On 9 November the IFA and the Department began meetings on this issue in Agriculture House. On 20 November the summary position was reached and following a meeting in Brussels, as IFA delegations reached Dublin for further negotiations they were given a copy of what they understood to be the position. Later that morning there were further discussions. A letter was issued from the Department on 23 November. This letter, it was agreed, set out the final position resulting from the negotiations. Four days later a further version of this letter was issued by the Department. This letter had a paragraph which has caused grave difficulties for farmers as it was a fundamental departure from the agreed position. The paragraph dealt with the issue of scanning sheep matter which had not been dealt with prior to this. Since that letter arrived, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has effectively dug its heels in and has presented the farmers affected by this with a most invidious choice. It is a Hobson's choice. They can either keep their flocks locked up or surrender to the Department. I suggest to the Minister here tonight that this issue can only be resolved by co-operative arrangements between the Department and the IFA. What has happened should be changed and I ask the Minister to instruct his Department officials to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Miss Fox Miss Fox">
      <NameTxt>Miss Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of restricted scrapie-positive flocks in the country and the way <Col N="944" /> these restricted flocks have been treated by the Department leaves a great deal to be desired. On 8 October a number of Department officials arrived on to 35 farms to serve restriction orders. These officials were not able to give information to the farmers in question on the duration or circumstances of the restrictions. The IFA met Department officials on a number of occasions to discuss how to deal with the compensation issue and it has produced a discussion document drawn up by independent consultants on how to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, when this document was discussed with the Department a number of crucial parts relating to the special circumstances of individual farmers were knocked back by the Department. No distinction was allowed by the Department among any farms in the compensation packages it would agree to and it refused to discuss the costs involved in establishing new flocks. I urge the Minister to ensure that there is a change in attitude in the Department in its handling of this matter. Farmers entered negotiations in a co-operative manner to try and pursue a fair solution. However, the process has been stymied from the word go. The delay in the matter is preventing these farmers from making an income and the fact their sheep they are locked up is being used as a stick to try and force a one-sided agreement. That is completely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Department will have to seriously consider helping with the costs associated with restocking. It must look at the bigger picture and try to find ways to eliminate the disease. Department officials will require the co-operation of flock owners to help in the eradication of scrapie. It is time they were reminded of that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time with me. This issue is about negotiations carried out in good faith on which the Department has reneged. One of the flock owners said:</P>
      <P>In conclusion, it can be seen that these negotiations, which were entered into in the spirit of co-operation and in pursuit of an acceptable and fair solution to the problem of restrictive flocks, have deteriorated into a very one-sided and dictatorial position on the part of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dukes, raised this issue during Question Time as far back as 23 October and in response Deputy Ó Cuív stated that the words &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; meant as soon as possible after the evaluation process was completed and that they had to agree the evaluation process and make the arrangements. Many of these flocks are facing into the lambing season. I put it to the Minister that we do not want promises. We want solutions that are acceptable to everybody. At the moment these flock owners are being treated in a very high-handed and <Col N="945" /> unfair manner. If the political will is there it can be solved. Please solve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available there is little I can say and most of it has already been said. The word &ldquo;depopulation&rdquo; is a serious word to any farmer. These farmers have been told by the Department that they must depopulate their flocks. There is a dispute in progress between the Department and the farmers who are represented by the IFA. I have had lengthy discussions with the Department and with the IFA but there is no sign of a solution. The Minister must clarify the situation tonight. The first letter was sent out on 23 November and the second on 27 November. The Minister is quite aware that there is a paragraph in that to which the IFA objects.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;depopulation&rdquo; has a devastating effect on any family. Wexford has the largest number of affected sheep flocks, between 15 and 17. One affected farmer in Wexford was closed up for also having BSE in his herd, but the herd was found not to have it when examined by Department officials. A further reason for closing him down was the foot and mouth disease threat. This all happened in the past six months and now he is being told he must depopulate his flock. I urge the Minister to clarify this tonight. We are coming to the lambing season in Wexford and some of the flocks have already started lambing. A serious problem will develop if the issue is not resolved. This must be cleared up in the next few days and I appeal to the Minister to do that. I ask him to be sympathetic to the farmers in view of the prevailing circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Scrapie has been present in sheep here for some 200 years, and there is a low incidence of the disease in Ireland. It is, however, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, (TSE). Therefore, notwithstanding the lack of evidence scientifically linking it to BSE, or CJD in humans, there is no doubt that its profile has increased among consumers in recent times, against a background of increased concern about TSEs generally.</P>
      <P>This level of concern was increased by the expectation that on 19 October the UK authorities would announce the results of a scientific study indicating that sheep in the UK in the early 1990s may have had BSE rather than scrapie. In the event, it emerged that the brains tested in the UK exercise may have been bovine rather than sheep brains and this study has now largely been discredited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard the view of the scientific steering committee of the European Commission on this matter on 24 October, 2001, was that there was no evidence that BSE was present in small ruminants under field conditions. However, the com<Col N="946" /> mittee also indicated that the possibility that sheep fed with meat and bonemeal in the past might potentially be infected with BSE could not be ruled out. Against this background, in order to address any residual, subliminal concern on the part of consumers and to maintain the high level of confidence in Irish food it is desirable that we seek to eradicate scrapie from the national flock.</P>
    <P>A scrapie control programme has already been operating in this country for some considerable time. This programme was developed in the context of controlling TSEs generally and includes compulsory notification, a ban on meat and bonemeal, removal of specified risk materials, testing at meat factories, research into developing genetically resistant sheep, and strain typing research.</P>
    <P>Acknowledging the desirability of eradicating the disease from the national flock it was decided to substantially expand my Department's programme for the control and eradication of scrapie. To that end, flocks which have had cases of scrapie since 1999, including a number in Counties Wicklow and Wexford, have been restricted. The intention is that these flocks will be culled and restocking will not be permitted for a period of two years from the date of depopulation.</P>
    <P>Other flocks which have a history of scrapie are being examined and may also be slaughtered out. This depopulation component, which offers an effective means of addressing known cases of scrapie in the short-term, complements the medium term element of enhanced testing and the longer term element of genetic research, all of which are components of our approach to effectively addressing the eradication of the disease.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that this may be a bitter pill to swallow for some of the flock owners concerned. However, it is clear that the elimination of scrapie is in their long-term interests and in those of the 40,000 or so farm families involved in the sheep sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department has been in negotiations with the IFA in relation to the provision of compensation to the flock owners concerned. The approach throughout has been to facilitate early depopulation of the flocks in question by offering a package which encompasses compensation for the market value of each depopulated flock and for loss of profit over the two year period in which destocking is not permitted and in the year restocking commences. It also addresses a number of other concerns expressed by the flock owners through the IFA. That offer has been on the table since 21 November, when discussions with the IFA concluded, and my Department has since been on stand-by to begin depopulation under the terms of the package. There is no question, and never was, of the Department &ldquo;rowing back&rdquo; in any way from the outcome to discussions with the IFA on this matter and it is a misrepresentation to present <Col N="947" /> this picture. It is a matter for each flock owner to decide whether he or she wishes to accept the Department's offer.</P>

      <P>As I recently indicated to the House, the Government's response to the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions was announced by the Minister for Finance on 28 September 2001. The Government decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and to establish the working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The operational details of the implementation of the commission's recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group, to be made within six months of the Government decision. Parallel structures &ndash; subject to the same time frame and remit &ndash; are to be established in the case of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Finance has had discussions with the public services committee of the ICTU regarding the establishment of the main working group and that the terms of <Col N="951" /> reference have been agreed. It is hoped that a plenary meeting of this working group will be held as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the parallel structures for the Defence Forces will operate to the same time frame and remit as the main working group. Once the final arrangements for the conduct of the business of the main group have been put in place, it would be my intention to get the Defence Forces group up and running without delay.</P>

      <P>By 31 October 2001 a total of 16,003 claims had been received in my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. Some 255 claims have been the subject of court awards with a further 9,513 being disposed of through out of court settlements. A further 428 claims were either withdrawn by plaintiffs or dismissed by the courts. Some 5,807 claims are still outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> As I mentioned in my reply of 18 October this year, following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the leading army hearing loss case of Hanley, which was delivered in December 1999, my Department in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office and in consultation with the Law Society of Ireland, established an early settlement scheme, ESS, for dealing with the outstanding army hearing loss litigation claims. The scheme operated successfully on a pilot basis during the year 2000 and 1,099 claims were settled by way of direct negotiations between solicitors representing plaintiffs and officials of the Chief State Solicitor's office and my Department.</P>
    <P>Given the success of the pilot scheme, my Department expanded the ESS in January of this year. In this regard, five firms of liability loss adjusters have been engaged in order to expand the capacity of the scheme and to augment the resources of the Chief State Solicitor's office in conducting settlement negotiations.</P>
    <P>The scheme has continued to operate successfully and the current position is that by 31 October 2001, a further 1,914 claims had been resolved, while I understand that plaintiffs' solicitors have recommended settlement in a further 280 cases. In addition, negotiations are ongoing in a further 1,412 claims.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that offers are being made in all cases where my Department has consistent audiograms and indeed in many cases where there is only one audiogram either on behalf of the State or the plaintiff in order to facilitate an early settlement. It is not true to say, as it is sometimes alleged, that offers of settlement are being confined to cases listed for hearing in the courts. Also in this regard I am concerned at reports that only 50% of the appointments for an audiogram arranged by the State are being taken up. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many solicitors who have engaged in the scheme in the interests of their clients and to urge all solicitors to encourage their clients to attend the appointments arranged or to forward any audiograms they have on record so that consideration can be given to the early settlement of these cases.</P>
    <P>As it is sometimes suggested that offers being made are not realistic or are being made on a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; basis, perhaps I should also take this opportunity to say that the offers being made are in line with the Supreme Court judgment and court precedent and negotiations are conducted in light of the particular circumstances of each individual case. The fact that over 3,000 cases have been finalised successfully would suggest that the entitlements of both the plaintiff and the taxpayer are being met in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of all involved I am still hopeful that the early settlement scheme will continue to operate successfully and that the vast majority of the outstanding claims will be resolved in this way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 15 May 2001, on 27 April 1981, an observation post in South Lebanon manned by Private Hugh Doherty and Private Kevin Joyce serving with the Irish Battalion in UNIFIL came under attack. Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing. Some <Col N="954" /> equipment was also missing. The attackers are unknown.</P>
    <P>I wish to again assure the House that efforts to obtain information on the whereabouts of Private Joyce have been ongoing since his disappearance. I have raised the matter with the Israeli ambassador and the matter has also been pursued by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Palestinian authorities. During a meeting in the Department of Foreign Affairs in August last year, the then Palestinian Representative to Ireland, the late Dr. Youssef Allan, undertook to pursue the matter with his authorities. The Department of Foreign Affairs has also asked the Representative Office of Ireland to the Palestinian Authority, in Ramallah, to make inquiries with the Palestinian authorities there. The EU Special Representative to the Middle East Peace Process, Ambassador Moratinos was also advised on the case by the Department of Foreign Affairs and asked for any assistance he may be able to provide.</P>
    <P>During my visits to UNIFIL I have taken every opportunity to raise the issue both with government and local representatives and with the Lebanese media, most recently on 12 November last during my visit to the Irish Battalion for the closing ceremony in Camp Shamrock when I met with local leaders and appealed once again for information which might lead to the location of the remains of Private Joyce. In addition, each successive Irish Battalion from 1981 was tasked with pursuing the matter. During the tour of duty of the final Irish Battalion to serve with UNIFIL the battalion commander and his staff did everything possible to try to find new information in the matter. Prior to his departure from the mission area, the battalion commander was given assurances from all the figures with whom he had contact that any new information would be passed on to the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Both my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs have given all due priority to efforts to locate the whereabouts of Private Joyce. Unfortunately those efforts have proved fruitless to date.</P>
    <P>In April 2001 Private Joyce's brother and sister visited the scene of the incident in South Lebanon.</P>

      <P>The table which I propose to circulate with the Official Report indicates the number of female personnel within the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 November 2001. These figures provide a breakdown between officers and various non-com<Col N="955" /> missioned ranks across each of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
      <P>Some 61 female personnel have been recruited to the Defence Forces during the current recruitment campaign. One female direct entry engineer officer was appointed to the Engineer Corps in the rank of lieutenant on 28 May 2001. Six female army cadets were commissioned as second-lieutenants on 2 July 2001 and four female Naval Service cadets were commissioned as ensigns on 6 September 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and that on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not <Col N="956" /> possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>
    <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5' 4&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>A consultant was appointed on 11 July 2001 to report on the runways in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The report, received and approved by my Department on the 16 October 2001, concluded that while the runways are in excellent structural condition, there are some problems in relation to the crossfall of the runways and with localised spalling of the runway surface which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>The consultant advised on the necessary interim remedial works to be carried out, pending the appointment of contractors to carry out major resurfacing. Remedial works such as regular sweeping of the runway are carried out as necessary.</P>
      <P>In addition, a brief was prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers to provide the complete upgrading of the runways and taxiways. A number of civil engineering consultancy firms were selected, and interviews were held on 15, 19 and 22 November 2001.</P>
      <P>The successful firm has been appointed and has been requested to prepare tender documentation as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 56, 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 the Government moved quickly and decisively to respond to the evolving international situation. As I indicated to the House on 18 October 2001 the Government was briefed regularly by the security committee on current developments. A high level contact group was established and first met on 12 September 2001. This group consists of senior representatives of all of the key Departments and agencies charged with responsibility for emergency planning and internal national security.</P>
      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is continuing. Since the 1980s, the emphasis in planning was on peacetime emergencies, whereas now we are faced with new threats arising from international terrorism. In those circumstances the establishment of this contact group was further supported by the Government decision, on 2 October 2001, to establish the Office of Emergency Planning at the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>The new office is working with all Departments and agencies, which have emergency planning responsibilities, to meet these new threats, including the co-ordination of the responses. In addition, it will exercise an oversight role in relation to planning for peacetime emergencies in order to make maximum use of resources and to ensure compatibility and co-ordination between the different emergency planning requirements. The existing lead role of Departments and agencies in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will of course continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high level contact group has met on nine occasions to review emergency planning issues since 11 September 2001 and has been supported in this role by the Office of Emergency Planning. Following the new threat environment, the Taoiseach established an emergency planning task force on 18 October 2001, which I am chairing. <Col N="958" /> The functions of the high level contact group have now been subsumed into the task force.</P>
    <P>The Office of Emergency Planning provides a key support role to the emergency planning task force and, under its chairmanship, co-ordinates the work of an interdepartmental working group, IDWG, on emergency planning established to assist the work of the task force. The task force has been meeting regularly to review the various emergency planning and response issues. The task force has ensured that responses to suspected incidents such as anthrax scares were approached in a measured way. The task force introduced proper on-site risk assessment procedures to ensure that these incidents were dealt with efficiently and effectively and with the minimum of disruption to the public.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has established an expert committee on biological threats to look at how our response to biological threats can be strengthened. The group first met on 1 October 2001 and its work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The National Civil Aviation Security Committee has been reviewing security for flights and at airports on an ongoing basis and this work has been accelerated since the events of 11 September. It is prudent that the security situation is kept under constant review by the task force in light of any escalation in international terrorism.</P>
    <P>Meetings at European Union and United Nations level have been held to examine the issue of terrorism. Arising from these meetings, it is intended that a number of new international agreements on terrorism will be agreed. The most important defence against any possible attack is detection and prevention by the security forces.</P>
    <P>The major emergency planning framework is designed to provide immediate responses by the emergency services &ndash; Garda Síochána, health, fire services, etc. &ndash; to any major incident. This framework is then developed at local level to take account of specific risks, such as a chemical factory or combustible fuel storage facility. These frameworks are being adapted to facilitate the best response by the emergency services to any incident resulting from the use of chemical or biological agents.</P>
    <P>The possibility of a threat from airborne radioactivity from any nuclear plant in neighbouring countries has been the subject of emergency planning for many years. The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents provides a structure for the management of the effects of such an incident. The plan involves monitoring the track of a radioactive plume, advising people in its path to take shelter and a range of measures to alleviate the impact of such an incident and to keep the public informed.</P>
    <P>The plan was already under review when the events of 11 September took place. It has been the subject of independent evaluation including a desktop exercise last July and a more substantial exercise on 10 November 2001. The Department of Public Enterprise issued an advisory notice <Col N="959" /> concerning nuclear safety immediately after the exercise took place in both the national and the provincial newspapers. The evaluation of the plan is ongoing and a review of the exercise programme is being undertaken later this month. A revised edition of the plan will be distributed to the public early in the new year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report to this House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and agencies through the emergency planning task force, the Office of Emergency Planning and the interdepartmental working group.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as chairman of the task force, I would like to thank those who have been actively involved across a range of disciplines, Departments and agencies in supporting the work of the task force. I will regularly report to Government and to this House on the progress being made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Lebanon during the period 12 to 13 November 2001. During my visit I was accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>On 12 November I paid a courtesy call on the Acting Force Commander at UNIFIL HQ in Naquora. Later that day I paid a visit to Qana, the site of the massacre of approximately 100 civilians while in a UN compound in 1996. I travelled on to the headquarters of the Irish Battalion in Tibnin. I also met local leaders &ndash; mayors and muchtars &ndash; in Tibnin, Barashit, Haddatah and At Tiri.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of my visit was to attend the marching out parade at 7 a.m. on 13 November at Tibnin which marked the withdrawal of the Irish contingent from UNIFIL after 23 years service in Lebanon. At the ceremony, the Irish Battalion headquarters, known as Camp Shamrock was handed over to the commanding officer of the Ghanaian Battalion who will now occupy it. This was an emotional occasion evoking primarily memories of those Irish Defence Force personnel who lost their lives while on service with UNIFIL, as well as the long period of involvement of successive Irish contingent personnel in the daily lives and culture of the people of South Lebanon. Ireland's contribution to UNIFIL has been highly <Col N="960" /> valued by both the United Nations and the Lebanese people. The Irish contingent's programme of humanitarian aid to local people which was funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs was greatly appreciated. Our UNIFIL role was also of inestimable significance to the Defence Forces which obtained valuable training and experience in peacekeeping during those twenty three years in Lebanon. Ireland's considerable contribution to peace in Lebanon has reflected well on Ireland as a nation and has enhanced our reputation abroad.</P>
    <P>On a previous visit to UNIFIL in September 2001, I unveiled a fitting and permanent memorial to those members of the Defence Forces who gave their lives in the service of peace in Lebanon.</P>

I am advised that, in this regard, appropriate manning levels are deployed consistent with security requirements at any given time. In addition the use of modern surveillance technology has become an important element in providing security at many installations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 73, 77, 157 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>With the deployment tomorrow of the main body &ndash; 154 personnel &ndash; of the Defence Forces contingent to serve with the United Nations Mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE, the total number of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas will be 505. Full details are set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Requests for personnel of the Defence Forces to serve on overseas missions are considered on their merits in the prevailing circumstances within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS. As I have indicated to the House previously, in October 1998 Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time under this system. There would, however, be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 June 2001, in the context of the withdrawal of the Irish contingent from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the UN formally invited Ireland to contribute a guard and administration company to serve with <Col N="962" /> UNMEE at the force headquarters in Asmara, Eritrea, with effect from 11 December 2001, for a minimum period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>On 18 July 2001, the Government subject to the approval of the Dáil authorised the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE for a period of one year from December 2001. On 26 October 2001, Dáil Éireann approved the dispatch of the contingent which will comprise 209 Defence Forces personnel. An advance party was deployed to the mission area on 26 November 2001. The main body of the contingent will, as I have stated, be deployed tomorrow. The contingent is required to become operational on 11 December 2001.</P>
    <P>I agreed, at the UN's request, to the deployment of two officers of the Defence Forces in June 2001, as military liaison officers, to the UN peace support operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo-MONUC.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, in the case of peace support operations, humanitarian tasks go hand in hand with military tasks. I am pleased that the Defence Forces have embraced this aspect with willingness and enthusiasm and the fruits of their endeavours can be seen in Lebanon in the orphanage at Tibnin; in Sarajevo, where they undertook the reconstruction of homes which had been burnt out in the conflict, and in East Timor as a result of their involvement with a local school. I envisage a humanitarian dimension to the Defence Forces involvement with UNMEE also and my Department is in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs in this regard.</P>
    <P>In addition, from time to time members of the Defence Forces avail of special leave, on an unpaid basis, in order to work in a personal capacity with various non governmental organisations overseas.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House earlier today, the roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence which was published in February 2000. To aid the civil power &ndash; meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána who have the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State &ndash; is among the assigned roles. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the gardaí as required in duties which include cash escorts.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have been requested by the gardaí to provide assistance in securing cash in transit as part of the euro changeover. Such assistance has been rendered by the Defence Forces since 30 October 2001 and liaison between the gardaí and the Defence Forces in this regard is continuing. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me for reasons of security to indicate details of the nature or level of such assistance.</P>

      <P>The representative associations PDFORRA and RACO signed and agreed to the terms of Partnership 2000 in November 1998, considerably later than other public service groups. Consequently, the process of setting up partnership arrangements in the Defence Forces did not commence as early as in other sectors of the public service. I believe that the partnership approach can be used to good effect in the management of the changes being undertaken throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Discussions were held with both representative associations in relation to the introduction of partnership structures in the Defence Forces. A number of technical and procedural issues arose and are being examined at present. When these issues are resolved the Defence Forces national partnership steering group committee will be set up. Following this, individual partnership committees will be set up at local level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 68, 90, 159 and 164 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated to the House on 22 November 2001, the Government fully support the efforts of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to set up a transitional administration in Afghanistan as soon as possible. The Government believes that only a fully representative and broad-based government will ensure long-term peace and security in Afghanistan. EU foreign <Col N="966" /> ministers also reiterated their support for this approach at their meeting on 19 November.</P>
    <P>The process of putting in place a new administration will need to be undertaken in a secure environment and the various options for restoring long-term security will have to be examined carefully. The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative has made it clear that his preferred option is for an all-Afghan force supported, in the interim, by a multinational element. Security Council Resolution 1378, which was adopted in New York on 13 November, endorsed this approach.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1378 also affirmed that the UN should play a central role in supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to establish a transitional administration leading to the formation of a new Government. However, while the UN is currently involved in the process which it is hoped will lead to the formation of such an administration, it is not possible at this stage to say exactly how the UN's role in Afghanistan will develop. The question of the possible deployment of Defence Forces personnel to a UN peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan does not, therefore, arise at this stage.</P>
    <P>If requested by the UN at some future date to contribute Defence Forces personnel to a UN-mandated mission in Afghanistan, the Government would, of course, give serious consideration to such a request. Requests from the UN for Irish participation in new missions are considered on a case by case basis within the context of the United Nations stand-by arrangement system &ndash; UNSAS. As I have indicated to the House previously, in October 1998 Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time under this system. Should the Government decide to seek Dáil approval to send military personnel to serve with a particular mission, full account would be taken of the security situation in the area, the mandate of the mission and such other factors as the equipment and skills necessary for the mission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> On 23 April 1996 the Government approved the establishment of a dedicated Garda air support unit, GASU, as recommended in the report of the interdepartmental group on air support for the Garda Síochána. The service provided through the Garda air support unit which was inaugurated in September 1997 comprises Garda Síochána and Air Corps personnel and operates from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The Garda Síochána are responsible for the operational control and policing functions, while the Air Corps personnel have responsibility for the flying and maintenance functions of the service. Two aircraft are operated by the Air Corps on behalf of the Garda Síochána, one twin engine AS355N Squirrel Helicopter and one Defender 4000 fixed wing aircraft. On 10 November 1998 the Government approved the acquisition of a second twin engine helicopter with a 24 hour capability for the GASU. This new helicopter, an EC 135, is due for delivery in the very near future. The Government decided on 20 November 2001 to contract out the piloting and maintenance of the new Garda EC 135 helicopter for a trial period of at least 12 months and the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to facilitate, oversee and assess the trial taking into account existing Air Corps services in this area. This decision does not effect the current piloting and maintenance service for existing GASU aircraft which, as stated, is provided at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of night flying training for Air Corps pilots, on 12 May 1999, during an operation in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda air support unit helicopter inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations, one of which was that &ldquo;the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps GASU pilots&rdquo;. This recommendation was implemented.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing GASU operation, I announced, in February 2000, that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the GASU. Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000, a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence issued.</P>
    <P>The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer <Col N="968" /> from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued only to Eurocopter through their Irish agent, Atron based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. However, Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which they could guarantee and support.</P>
    <P>Efforts to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter were also not successful. The prospect of obtaining a second hand Squirrel helicopter for this work are not good given the experience in the tender competitions and the buoyancy of the market for such helicopters.</P>
    <P>This matter is the subject of on-going communication between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

Lectures and briefings in this area have continued over the years as an integral element of the training syllabus on recruit, cadet and career courses, and in addition on those occasions when troops are undergoing training for duty overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> Early this year, the Defence Forces commenced a re-examination of procedures to bring them into line with the best state of the art practice in both the wider public service and in the private sector. In April, the section in the administrative instruction, which deals with the procedures concerning allegations of bullying, was revised to reflect this. The report of the Government Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, published in March of this year, requires all public and private organisations to reassess their policies. The Defence Forces will actively participate in this review and re-assessment exercise.</P>
    <P>All incidents of sexual harassment brought to the attention of the military authorities are thoroughly investigated. Additional procedures are also being put in place by the Chief of Staff. Each barracks will have a female liaison officer, known and available to all females in barracks. Each formation commander will arrange women's days on a periodic basis to cover issues such as interpersonal relationships and women's health issues.</P>
    <P>An internal information campaign of posters, and a simplified &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; booklet, will convey the essential message of the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships. Briefings and open discussions with mixed gender attendance are to be conducted by formation commanders and will continue on a periodic basis. I am satisfied that the military authorities are quite properly emphasising again the serious nature of this subject for all personnel. The importance of establishing the proper environment cannot be over emphasised. The Chief of Staff has stated that commanders at all levels should bear in mind that it is a command responsibility to ensure that the military environment is free from any form of sexual harassment and bullying. He has further stated that any failure by a commander to ensure that such is the case, or to deal adequately with complaints of sexual harassment or bullying, would be considered a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The Chief of Staff has established a special military steering group to examine these issues. I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's task force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, to join the group as an expert civilian chairperson. Her task is to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures, and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. She has been joined by two other civilian experts, who previously worked with her on the original Government task force, and by senior military personnel, including the Deputy Chief of Staff &ndash; support &ndash; and a senior female army officer. Dr. Doyle and the joint civilian-military group will now proceed to produce a report by March 2002.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> In the interim Dr. Doyle and her team have had a number of meetings during which they have been briefed on Defence Forces organisation, structures and procedures with particular emphasis on personnel issues including interpersonal relations. Dr. Doyle and her committee have also met with representatives of both RACO and PDFORRA.</P>
    <P>A social psychology researcher has prepared a questionnaire which will be distributed to approximately 10% of Defence Forces personnel. The questionnaire is intended to capture the actual nature and extent of any bullying, harassment, sexual harassment or discrimination within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces fully recognise that the singular nature of the military environment does not give anyone a general licence for bullying or harassment of any kind. Such behaviour will not be tolerated.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements.</P>
      <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001. Two bids were received one of which was from Dublin Corporation. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property, which remains on the market. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs.</P>

      <P>The tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps is ongoing. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on this matter shortly.</P>
      <P>The tender competition for the supply of the helicopters is being carried out under EU contracts procedures. The award of contract criteria set out in the tender documentation states that the contract will be awarded on the basis of the most strategically and economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria, not necessarily in order of priority: functional characteristics; technical merit; all maintenance and on-line technical support; after sales service and warranty terms on offer; cost and ready availability of spare parts; tender prices; and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period.</P>
      <P>I am advised that other factors cannot be taken into account as part of the evaluation process. It is not possible to alter the award of contract criteria once the competition has begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> There is no provision in EU procurement directives for the use of offset and therefore it is not the practice of the Department of Defence to consider offset or countertrade issues in the assessment of tenders. In any event, it would not be possible to measure objectively the value of such offers in the assessment of tenders. The long-term economic effects of such offers would be unquantifiable for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on countertrade, were they to be a consideration in the course of a tender competition, would invariably take place between the tenderer and a company or number of companies located here. In such circumstances there could be no control over the conduct of those negotiations by the Department in question.</P>
    <P>From the point of view therefore of maintaining a truly competitive process any consideration of countertrade should only come into play after a decision to enter into contract negotiations with the chosen tenderer.</P>
    <P>Once a decision on the merits has been made on a particular contract it is the practice in my Department to seek offset in Ireland in the case of major contracts. It is, of course, made clear to the contractor that there is no legal or contractual obligation to provide such offset. Many contracts have resulted in significant offset to the benefit of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, I announced that I had decided that the time was right to proceed with the establishment of a statutory ombudsman for the Defence Forces. I emphasised that, in establishing this office, it was important to ensure that a credible complaints system would be provided, one which would be fair to all members of the Forces, while at the same time safeguarding the operational flexibility of the Defence Forces. Officials of my Department met with both of the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations &ndash; PDFORRA and RACO &ndash; to advise them of the position. It was indicated to them that the Department would, following a period of detailed consideration of the issues involved, bring forward proposals to give effect to my decision.</P>
      <P>Prior to that, PDFORRA had submitted their own proposals to my Department which set out their views and concerns regarding the establishment and functions of a Defence Forces ombudsman. Following on from this, a number of informal meetings took place between officials of my Department and PDFORRA in order to clarify aspects of that association's proposals. The concerns of PDFORRA have received due consideration in the course of the formulation of final proposals in relation to the establishment of a statutory ombudsman for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Meetings also took place with the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers &ndash; RACO &ndash; with regard to the proposal for the Defence Forces ombudsman.</P>
      <P>In July this year, the Government approved the drafting of an Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill. The drafting of the Bill by the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government, in consultation with my Department, is now at an advanced stage. On completion of the drafting, the Bill will be submitted to Government for approval of the draft text of the Bill and for authority to publish it and to circulate it to Deputies. I am confident that the Bill will be published in the very near future and I anticipate that it will be enacted by Easter 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>The current Air Corps fleet consists of 32 aircraft, 18 fixed wing aircraft and 14 helicopters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in <Col N="975" /> the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I announced on 1 March of last year, the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport. I expect to make an announcement on this matter shortly. In addition, tender documentation recently issued for the lease of a replacement aircraft for the Beechcraft and responses are due in early January 2002.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other equipment requirements in the Air Corps. In this regard, I am still awaiting the submission of a strategic plan for the organisation which is to be presented by the military authorities. This plan is to include recommendations on a complete fleet replacement programme in order of priority. In this regard, the issue of air defence is being examined by the military authorities in light of the terrible events of September 11. The possible acquisition of aircraft to fulfil an air defence role is also a consideration.</P>
    <P>A priority for the Air Corps is the requirement to acquire fixed wing training aircraft for Air Corps cadets and officers. When proposals for fixed wing training aircraft are received in tandem with the strategic plan I will arrange for my Department to progress the matter as one of urgency.</P>
    <P>This will address the issue of the lack of suitable aircraft for the training of cadets and will permit the effective and efficient training of Air Corps flying officers. There are other methods of training pilots in place at present to deal with any perceived lack of flying hours on aircraft. Simulators are used in addition to the provision of training courses abroad as required.</P>

      <P>Following a tender competition which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 Armoured Personnel Carriers, APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses.</P>
      <P>The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full production run on the APCs is well under way. A total of 22 APCs have now been delivered to the Curragh Camp. In addition, a further APC has been accepted by the Department but was retained in Switzerland for training purposes. The balance of the APCs will be delivered by the end of February to the beginning of March next year &ndash; almost two years ahead of previous expectations. Training of Defence Force personnel on the APCs has been continuing apace and the first overseas deployment of the <Col N="977" /> APCs has taken place with the despatch of five APCs to Eritrea for service with UNMEE.</P>
    <P>In August 2001, the appearance of cracks in the hulls of three APCs was noticed in the Curragh Camp. The issue was dealt with as a warranty item under the guarantee given by Mowag under the contract. Detailed discussions took place between Mowag and the Department on the cracks and expert investigations were put in train to determine their exact cause. I am advised that these cracks are not entirely unusual because of the type of manufacturing process involved in the production of the steel hulls of the APCs.</P>
    <P>As part of the investigations which are still ongoing, a range of remedial actions have been taken to deal with the issues raised as a result of the appearance of the cracks and the cracks on the three APCs were repaired. Cracks have also appeared in the hulls of three other APCs and again they are being dealt with as a warranty item. The repairs to the hulls will not affect the integrity of the ballistic protection afforded by the APCs. An extended warranty has been agreed with Mowag to cover the Department against the possibility of the appearance of cracks in any of the 40 APCs to be delivered under the contract.</P>
    <P>The question of the supply of an additional 20 APCs is the subject of ongoing negotiations with Mowag.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 161 and 163 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence which was published by my Department in February 2000 sets out a comprehensive strategy for a restructuring and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are in a position to meet the requirements of Government in the changing national and international spheres. This strategy was founded on an assessment by the Government of both the national and international security environment &ndash; including risks to international peace <Col N="978" /> generating from conflict in other continents. Responses to international terrorism involve co-ordination from a wide variety of organisations including the Defence Forces. I am satisfied in this regard that the White Paper continues to provide a suitable framework for the development of the Defence Forces in order to respond to new threats in the context of a changing international security environment.</P>
    <P>The strategy for Defence Forces strength and organisation for the next ten years is an integral element of the White Paper process. In this regard, the Government has concluded that the Permanent Defence Force requires a strength of 10,500 personnel, ready to fulfil tasks at home and abroad. This figure comprises 8,426 for the Army, 930 for the Air Corps and 1,144 for the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>The training opportunities provided by Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace will further enhance the development of the Defence Forces. In this regard, Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in our presentation document of 1 December 1999, which outlined our five priority areas of participation as: co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment; and co-operation in marine matters.</P>
    <P>Ireland's first individual partnership programme &ndash; IPP &ndash; covered the period up to 31 December 2001. Activities in the year 2001 focused on the enhancement of current skills and expertise in such areas as operational and generic planning for peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command and control, operational procedures and logistics. Our second programme has been drawn up on the basis of experience gained with the initial IPP and it seeks to give practical content to the overall priorities identified in the presentation document.</P>
    <P>I should stress that participation in PfP activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. In accordance with this fundamental principle, all decisions regarding the content and form of the IPP for 2002-03 have been made by the Irish authorities.</P>
    <P>The activities selected are training courses, workshops, seminars and table top exercises. It does not involve military manoeuvres or large scale military exercises. Neither are there any plans to hold bilateral or multilateral military exercises with the armed forces of other EU countries.</P>

      <P>The inaugural meeting of the National Forum on Europe took place on 18 October.</P>
      <P>The costs which have accrued to date in respect of the forum amount to £71,548.31 or 90,847.61.</P>
      <P>This is broken down as follows: salaries £52,480 &ndash; 66,635.85; attendance allowances £3,780.00 &ndash; 4,799.61; travel and subsistence £2,132.05 &ndash; 2,707.15; catering £4,339.05 &ndash; 5,509.46; telephones and postage £3,512.17 &ndash; 4459.54; office equipment and stationery £4,729.47 &ndash; 6,005.19; and miscellaneous £575.57 &ndash; 730.82</P>
      <P>The full staffing complement has only recently been put in place. Accordingly, full staffing costs will only apply from this month onwards. Costs associated with the installation of a computer system for the forum's secretariat, the design and implementation of its website will fall due from mid to end December.</P>
      <P>The cost associated with operating each plenary is in the region of £10,000 or 12,697. To date five plenary sessions have been held with a further two planned to the end of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> An attendance allowance of £180 or 229 per forum sitting is payable to participants who are not separately paid from public funds or are not full-time officials of bodies such as trade unions, employer organisations, etc. It is strictly applied in cases where a loss of income arises from attending the forum. Expenses in relation to travel and subsistence are payable in accordance with civil service rates.</P>
    <P>The cost of operating the National Forum on Europe in 2002 is estimated at £1.56 million or 2.0 million. The principal features of the estimate are: salaries £450,000 &ndash; 571,382; attendance allowances and travel and subsistence £300,000 &ndash; 380,921; secretariat/research for delegation £100,000 &ndash; 126,973; and catering £120,000 &ndash; 152,368.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Carer's Leave Act, 2001, came into operation on 2 July 2001. The main purpose of the Act is to provide for a new entitlement for an employee to avail of temporary unpaid leave from his or her employment to enable him or her to personally provide full-time care and attention for a person who is medically certified as being in need of such care.</P>
      <P>The period of leave to which an employee is entitled is subject to a maximum of 65 weeks in respect of any one care recipient. The minimum statutory entitlement is 13 weeks.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, an employee must give written notice to his/her employer of the intention to take carer's leave, not later than six weeks before the employee proposes to commence the leave. Notwithstanding this provision, if in exceptional or emergency circumstances, it is not reasonably practicable for an employee wishing to avail of carer's leave, to give the required notice, such notice must be given as soon as it is reasonably practicable for the employee to do so.</P>
      <P>The Carer's Leave Act also provides that where an employee who is entitled to carer's leave, has taken leave purporting to be carer's leave but has not complied with the notice requirements, then the employer may, at his or her discretion, treat that leave as carer's leave for the purposes of the Carer's Leave Act, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an employer in exercising this discretion, refuses to treat leave as carer's leave, on reasonable grounds, he or she must specify the grounds in writing to the employee for such refusal. This matter may be treated as a dispute for the purposes of the Act. In other words, an <Col N="984" /> employee may refer a dispute in relation to the matter to a rights commissioner of the Labour Relations Commission for adjudication under the Act. Hearings of the rights commissioner under the Act are held in private. Such referrals must be made in writing within six months of the occurrence of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Finally, nothing in the Carer's Leave Act prevents an employer and an employee coming to a more favourable arrangement than that provided for in the Act, for example, in relation to the notice requirement.</P>
    <P>In light of the above provisions, I do not consider that a review of the Act is required.</P>

    <P>Over the past two years IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Border, mid<Col N="988" /> lands and west, BMW, region which includes Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>In an effort to ensure that this objective will be achieved, IDA Ireland re-organised its internal structures and recently transferred additional posts to Athlone, which will comprise staff from regions, property, and healthcare divisions bringing the staff complement up to 30. In addition posts are being transferred to Sligo comprising staff from international services and consumer products divisions bringing the staff complement up to 15. The purpose of these moves is to develop these centres as magnets for growth for these regions.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's incentive package is also strongly geared in favour of the BMW region which is in line with the new EU State aid limits. Greater focus is put on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</P>
    <P>On the industrial property front, the Finisklin Business Park in Sligo Town has been extended and plans are well advanced for new lands in Sligo. IDA is also currently marketing two vacant properties in Sligo. In Carrick on Shannon a new advance facility is nearing completion and consultants are being retained to bring the estate in the town up to business park standards.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has also focused its efforts in the BMW region. The agency works strongly with the higher education authorities within the regions and co-funds ongoing applied research and development with private companies. It plays an active role in building up the centres of excellence/innovation centres at the various colleges. In this regard, the Institute of Technology, Sligo, with its new business innovation centre supported by Enterprise Ireland, and St Angela's third level college, must be viewed as major infrastructural support to drive innovative capability within the county and the wider region.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland also helps SMEs in the regions to overcome technical barriers to growth by supporting them in the employment of local graduates. The agency works closely with the county enterprise boards who have an extensive network throughout the BMW region and have developed a specific expertise in supporting new micro enterprise formation, with very positive results to date in Sligo and Leitrim area. In addition, the FÁS training centre in Sligo has 500 trainees and specialises in training tool-making apprentices, plastic injection moulding and general engineering operatives.</P>
    <P>Improved access is crucial in establishing both indigenous and overseas investment to the regions and in this context the importance of improved road and air access cannot be over-emphasised. This has been recognised in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which includes plans to bring our roads, railway and air services up to a standard consistent with a modern economy within the next six years. Availability of high-quality telecommunications and energy supplies are also essential. Both <Col N="989" /> Enterprise and IDA Ireland are keeping in close contact with relevant infrastructure providers to ensure that they are aware of the agencies priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 to 113, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On completion of its report in 1999, payment to the company in question was made from subhead A7, consultancy services, of my Department's Vote. Follow-up action on the report was taken within my Department by the internal audit unit and by the forest service. Action on the report was monitored by my Department's high level accreditation group, which had responsibility for any issues which might impact on the Department's role as a paying agency in relation to the guarantee section of the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> While follow-up action is still outstanding on some individual files, there has to date been no case of suspected irregularity, as defined by European Council Regulation 2988/95, in respect of which it was necessary to make any financial correction to report to the European Commission. In those circumstances the question of seeking legal advice has not arisen.</P>
    <P>Finally, the company employed in an operationally independent basis to certify the annual accounts of the Department as a paying agency were made aware of the report in 1999 and, arising from allegations made to the Commission in summer 2000 by a confidential source, the Commission was also made aware of the report in 2000. My Department has responded in full to all issues raised by the Commission.</P>

      <P>The process of finalising the operational programme complements, the impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis and delays in EU State aid clearance, rather than the economic downturn, have to date more directly impacted on NDP investment in the marine and natural resources areas. Despite these factors significant progress on a range of marine and natural resources programmes has already been made and all measures will be fully up and running in 2002.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the budgetary parameters for 2002 will require some modification of the year on year indicative allocations over the seven year period of the NDP. In this context I will, in the coming weeks, be examining in detail the pre-budget and post-budget allocations for the marine and natural resources sectors with a view to ensuring that short-term priority commitments are met in the context of the overall investment envelope of some 1.7 billion for those sectors over the seven year period of the plan.</P>
      <P>My objective is to ensure that projects that have been selected to date, and those that will be selected under new proposals, can be completed within the overall timeframe of the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Question Nos. 121 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the reports to which the Deputies refer, which concern legal action directed against the Belarussian Student Association by the Belarussian authorities. Naturally I would be deeply concerned should the legitimate activities of student organisations be curtailed by legal actions of this kind. I have asked officials in my Department to follow closely developments in the case.</P>
      <P>Ireland endorses the conclusions drawn by the International Limited Election Observation Mission on the presidential elections held in Belarus on 9 September, in which President Lukashenko was re-elected. Together with our partners in the European Union, we greatly deplore the fact that these elections were not carried out in accordance with the Organisation for Co-operation and Security in Europe rules for the conduct of democratic elections. We deplore, in particular, the harassment of representatives of the opposition, national observers, the independent media and NGOs.</P>
      <P>The development of relations between the EU and Belarus is dependent on respect for human rights and the progress of democracy in that country. The conclusions of the EU General Affairs Council of September 1997 set out a framework for the EU's future relations with Belarus, including the limiting of bilateral ministerial contacts to the presidency or the Troika and the suspension of technical assistance programmes, except in the case of humanitarian or regional projects or those which directly support the democratisation process. These Council conclusions are still in place.</P>
      <P>We consider it regrettable that the Belarus authorities have not seized the opportunity afforded by the presidential elections to engage their country fully on the path of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports of recurrent violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms remain a cause for deep concern and I am aware of pressure being exerted by the authorities on a wide range of organisations, including opposition parties, human rights and other NGOs, and media outlets which are, or are suspected of being, opposed to the current regime. I reaffirm the appeal to President Lukashenko, made by the General Affairs Council in September 1997, to act in the interests of the Belarussian people and not to place his <Col N="999" /> country in a position of isolation to the detriment of both Belarus and Europe as a whole.</P>

      <Quest>the relationship of the Government with Pakistan; if in particular, he has acknowledged the problem confronted by that country in assisting the war against terrorism in Afghanistan; the support, financial and otherwise, which he has provided to Pakistan; his proposals in this regard in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1962, Ireland and Pakistan have enjoyed a very good bilateral relationship. Earlier this year this relationship was strengthened with the opening of a resident Embassy of Pakistan in Dublin and the appointment of Ambassador Rifat Iqbal, a development I warmly welcome.</P>
      <P>Our bilateral relations extend across many areas, including trade, education and culture. Pakistan is Ireland's 12th largest trading partner in Asia, with a combined total trade between Ireland and Pakistan reaching a new peak of £72.1 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>Since the events of 11 September and the commencement of military action in Afghanistan, the Government has been closely following developments in Pakistan. We have regularly exchanged information in contacts at the UN Security Council in New York and with the Embassy of Pakistan on the evolving situation in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week I spoke with my Pakistani counterpart, Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar and discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan as well as the situation in Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Pakistan's decision to join the international coalition against terrorism as a front-line state was a correct and courageous one and strongly welcomed by the Government. In the face of severe criticism, President Musharraf has remained resolute in his decision and is leading his country through a challenging period.</P>
      <P>Pakistan will have a particularly important role to play in the future of the region, in restoring peace and maintaining stability in Afghanistan. In my discussion with Foreign Minister Sattar this week, I welcomed the strong support Pakistan has lent to the UN-sponsored talks in Bonn and to the work of UN Special Representative Brahimi. I urge Pakistan to continue this vital co-operation.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of the assistance which Pakistan has extended to Afghan refugees fleeing Taliban persecution. The Pakistani Government has welcomed over two million refugees into the country, despite the destabilising effect their presence could have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> The £4 million in emergency assistance being provided by the Irish Government in response to the crisis in Afghanistan is balanced in focus between those at risk within Afghanistan and those seeking protection as refugees in neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan. Ireland Aid support therefore includes measures aimed at reducing the adverse impact of large numbers of refugees on local economies and infrastructure in Pakistan in particular. I urge the Pakistani Government to continue to work with international aid agencies bringing aid to those refugees and assisting their eventual return to Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>The European Union is making a significant development aid contribution to Pakistan. The EU's projects are targeted on the poorest groups of Pakistani society. The total of commitments for ongoing projects is 195 million and is focused predominantly on social sector development, such as primary education, the eradication of child labour, health, drug rehabilitation and environmental sustainability.</P>
    <P>In addition, the European Commission has proposed that Pakistan would benefit from the best possible access to the EU market short of a free trade agreement by making it eligible for the new special generalised system of preferences scheme for countries combating drugs. The package has been specifically designed to target clothing and textiles which account for three quarters of Pakistan's exports to the EU. The introduction of Pakistan into the special drugs regime will be included in the form of an amendment to the Commission's proposal for a new GSP regime for the period 2002-2004, which is currently under discussion by the Council. In November the EU signed a favourable co-operation agreement with Pakistan. This significant increase in the level of international assistance is not being extended to Pakistan unconditionally.</P>
    <P>We have made clear our expectations with regard to the return to full democracy in Pakistan. I welcome President Musharraf's plan entitled Roadmap to Democracy, according to which democratic elections will be held by October 2002, and urge him to keep closely to that plan. We will be closely monitoring developments in Pakistan over the coming months and assessing progress towards the restoration of democracy. Implementation of measures, such as the EU-Pakistan Co-operation Agreement, would be immediately reconsidered should there be any slippage in the timetable for the restoration of democracy.</P>
    <P>With regard to disarmament matters, the Government has repeatedly made clear its grave concern at the developments of 1998 when both Pakistan, and its neighbour India, conducted nuclear tests. This concern has been heightened by subsequent tests of ballistic missiles by both states. The continuing possession of nuclear weapons by Pakistan and India constitutes a major threat to regional peace and stability, and has serious implications for the nuclear non-prolifer<Col N="1001" /> ation regime and, by implication, the process of achieving nuclear disarmament worldwide.</P>
    <P>The Government also has a number of human rights concerns with regard to Pakistan, in particular the use of the death penalty. We will continue to raise these concerns with the Pakistani Government at every appropriate occasion.</P>

      <P>The latest information available to my Department is that Mr. Zhao Ming remains in detention in China on the charge of anti-social behaviour in relation to alleged Falun Gong activities.</P>
      <P>As he recently informed the Dáil, the Taoiseach raised this case in his discussions with the Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji in Dublin on 3 September. At that time Premier Zhu undertook to draw our concerns to the attention of the judicial authorities in China. As the Taoiseach also informed the Dáil, it has been confirmed to us that the Premier has done so.</P>
      <P>While recognising that Mr. Zhao is a Chinese citizen the Government remains concerned about his situation. Through our embassy in Beijing and contacts at other levels, the Government is monitoring his case on an ongoing basis and will keep Deputies informed as and when we receive further information.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first person named by the Deputy, my Department will follow up on this matter.</P>

      <P>In the period from 1 January to date, one reasoned opinion and one formal notice under Article 228 of the European Community Treaty have been issued by the European Commission and addressed to Ireland. They were both received in July. The reasoned opinion concerns the application of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the impact of certain public and private projects on the environment and the formal notice concerns the application of Directive 1999/47/EC on the transport of dangerous goods by road.</P>

      <P>Earlier in this session, in response to the Deputy, I conveyed the information that was then available to the Passport Office. I can now confirm, following further detailed work, including through the database of the Passport Office and through checking the position with each individual embassy and consulate, that the passports issued to the person to whom the Deputy refers and to his seven family members have not been renewed.</P>
      <P>This additional work has also shown that new passports have been issued to the other three persons, who were granted Irish citizenship at the same time as the person to whom the Deputy refers, through the embassy in London.</P>
      <P>In light of the raising of this issue by Deputy O'Keeffe, I have instructed that the question of granting further passport facilities in these cases, if it arises, will be fully reviewed, including at political level, before any decision is taken.</P>
      <P>Finally, in the absence of a revocation of the certificates of naturalisation in these cases, which area is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there would be no basis for withdrawing these passports.</P>

      <P>In the most recent competition for rights to generate and sell electricity employing renewable energy technologies, AER V, I reduced the capacity limit in the small scale wind category from 5 MW which applied in the previous competition to 3 MW. I also precluded large scale operators from entering the small scale category. The purpose of these measures is to encourage applications from local and community based small scale operators.</P>
      <P>The support provided in AER V is a contract between successful applicants and the ESB obliging the latter to purchase all the output from generating stations declared successful. This provides a guaranteed revenue stream which makes the projects bankable.</P>
      <P>In addition the entire green electricity market is now liberalised. Any undertaking is now entitled to apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation for the authority to generate, supply or consume electricity generated independently from renewable energy technologies. Support for such activity is limited to the tax relief available under section 486<i>b</i> of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>My reply to supplementary questions from the Deputy on Tuesday 27 November, in relation to Parliamentary Question No. 34, may have given the impression that the eurobond in question was issued by me. In order to avoid any potential confusion I wish to point out that Aer Rianta, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Aer Rianta Finance plc, issued a 250 million or £197 million eurobond in February. This loan facility required my approval, which I duly gave, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The bond has a maturity of ten years and a coupon interest rate of 6.15%. Interest is paid annually and the bond is not due for repayment until 2011.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that in April, again with my approval given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, Aer Rianta signed an 18 year facility for 125 million or £98.5 million with the European Investment Bank. This EIB facility will be used to part fund Aer Rianta's major development programme at Cork Airport.</P>

I am advised that this plan, which was commissioned jointly by Cork County Council and Cork Corporation, has recently been adopted by both councils.</P>
      <P>I am informed that a rail link to Cork Airport was not among the transport options put forward in the plan. However, I am advised that the plan does recognise the importance of improving public transport links to the airport. In that regard, the plan proposes the provision of a quality bus corridor with a high frequency service from the airport to the city centre and Kent Station. Improved journey times and reliability would be supported by the introduction of additional bus priority measures at the Kinsale Road roundabout and the south city link. These matters will now fall to be pursued by both Cork Corporation and Cork County Council in consultation with Bus Éireann.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann and the Corrib Partners, Enterprise Energy Ireland, Statoil and Marathon, have completed an agreement under which BGE will build a pipeline to bring Corrib gas from Mayo to connect into the proposed ring-main at Galway.</P>
      <P>Recently BGE submitted an application to my Department for consent to construct this pipeline. The scheduled completion date for the pipeline is August 2003. The Corrib partners expect to be flowing gas commercially in late 2003. BGE has signalled that Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry are likely to be connected in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Government decided, in principle, that the gas network should be extended to the north-west. An evaluation carried out by Bord Gáis has determined that this would require grant aid, as the demand for gas in the long-term would not be sufficient to pay for the capital cost of extending the system. Such grant aid would require State aid clearance from the EU Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the wider regional and socio-economic benefits of improving the energy infrastructure, <Col N="1019" /> the Government has decided to move ahead with the next stage of the project. This will involve conducting a detailed study on extending the gas network to Sligo via Ballina from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from Derry, which is expected to be served by a pipeline from Belfast. This study will fully define the pipeline extensions and give an accurate assessment of the levels of grant aid that would be necessary. At the same time my Department will submit a State aid case to the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>Following this phase of the project the issue of grant aid will be considered again by Government, provided that the necessary clearance has been obtained from the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Other than departmental committees which are established on an ongoing basis, the following groups have been set up in my Department since 1997.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 a steering group was established to oversee a special study of the Reserve Defence Force. The objective of the special study was to develop a blueprint for a more effective, efficient and value for money Reserve Defence Force. The group reported in August 1999.</P>
      <P>In July 1998 the Government approved the appointment of an interdepartmental task force on the future management and development of the Curragh of Kildare. The task force report was presented in June 1999 and was made available to the public in May 2000.</P>
      <P>The naval and air services consultation group was established in November 1998 on foot of the special studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service conducted by Pricewaterhouse consultants. The group's remit was to provide inputs to the naval and air services planning process which culminated with the completion of the Naval Service implementation plan and the Air Corps implementation plan. Following the completion of its work the group was disbanded in June.</P>
      <P>In August 1999 a review group was established to undertake an examination of the full range of medical services provided for members of the Defence Forces. Its other aim was to make recommendations as to the most economical, effective and efficient arrangements by which medical services can be delivered to the Defence Forces and having regard to the Defence Forces review implementation plan, the future organisation, staffing, resources, roles and responsibilities of the Medical Corps. The group reported in July 2000.</P>

      <Col N="1020" /> An interdepartmental Defence and Security Environment Assessment Group was established in February 2000. Its aim is to ensure that the Government is kept up to date on the implications for defence and the Defence Forces of developments in the defence and security environment.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore in 1999 a working group, comprising representatives from both the civilian and military branches of my Department and from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, was established in September 2000 to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the safety recommendations set out in that report. The work of this group is ongoing and regular progress reports are made.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Partnership 2000 Agreement for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness a number of partnership committees has been established.</P>
    <P>In August a special steering group, comprising members of the Defence Forces and civilian experts, was established to study the nature and extent of bullying-sexual harassment in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures, to make recommendations on strategies and programmes of awareness and education in the area. The group is expected to report next year.</P>
    <P>In September the Naval Service joint implementation team was established to oversee the implementation of the Naval Service implementation plan. It is envisaged that the team will report progress in due course.</P>
    <P>In October an interdepartmental working group on emergency planning was established to support the role and functions of the emergency planning task force and the Office of Emergency Planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31 July 2000 the United Nations Security Council, under Resolution 1312, established the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea &ndash; UNMEE &ndash; consisting of up to 100 military observers and the necessary civilian support staff in anticipation of a peacekeeping operation subject to future authorisation. Under Resolution 1320 of 15 September 2000, the Security Council authorised the deployment within UNMEE of up to 4,200 troops until 15 March. On the latter date, the Security Council by its Resolution 1344 extended UNMEE's mandate at the previously authorised levels of troops and military observers until 15 September. Resolution 1369 of 14 September extended the mandate for a further six months until 15 March 2002.</P>
      <P>On 15 June, in the context of the withdrawal of the Irish Contingent from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &ndash; UNIFIL &ndash; the UN formally invited Ireland to contribute a Guard and Administration Company to serve with UNMEE at the Force Headquarters in Asmara, Eritrea, with effect from 11 December, for a minimum period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>A Defence Forces team undertook a fact finding visit to the mission area during July to decide matters such as the precise role of the Defence Forces within UNMEE and the size of contingent needed to discharge that role, as well as the equipment required. A security assessment was also carried out taking account of the situation on the ground at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> On 18 July the Government authorised, subject to the approval of the Dáil, the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE for a period of one year from December. On 26 October Dáil Éireann approved the despatch of the contingent which will comprise 209 Defence Forces personnel. An advance party was deployed to the mission area on 26 November. The main body of the contingent will be deployed tomorrow. The contingent is required to become operational on 11 December.</P>
    <P>In response to a separate request from the UN, two members of the Defence Forces were deployed to the mission in June, to take up staff appointments in UNMEE Force headquarters in Asmara, Eritrea. Following further requests from the UN in September, seven more members of the Defence Forces will have taken up staff appointments in UNMEE Force HQ by the operational date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of the Irish contingent, which will be based in Asmara, Eritrea, it is proposed that the Defence Forces personnel will carry out the following tasks: provide signals technical support to UNMEE HQ; provide perimeter defence and internal security for UNMEE HQ building; provide security for convoys and escort of key personnel-VIPs; provide transport services for headquarters staff; provide tactical mobile command post; provide catering and accommodation facilities for transit personnel; provide manning of military staff message centre; provide military police for the Irish component, and liaison with Force military police unit; and provide military staff and general administrative support to UNMEE.</P>
    <P>With regard to the UNMEE mission, since the signing of the Algiers Agreement in December 2000 considerable progress has been achieved. With the exception of some isolated incidents, Ethiopia and Eritrea have complied with their commitment to keep the peace, in particular, through the establishment of the temporary security zone in April, the full deployment of UNMEE and the establishment of the two commissions on border demarcation and on compensation for war damages.</P>

      <P>Over 51,000 awards of the service medal relating to the War of Independence, 1917 to 1921, have been made to date. The number of women included in this figure is not readily available but it is considered that it would be relatively small.</P>
      <P>Military firing parties were provided, on request, at the funerals of veterans of the War of Independence but the precise number of women veterans so honoured, although estimated to be small, is not known.</P>

      <Quest>the status of lands at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, County Cork; and if in the context of the proposed integrated area plan, the Ballincollig social and community sector is being catered for as promised in the redevelopment of Murphy Barracks.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, a comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of this property. My Department submitted the plan to Cork County Council in April 2000 for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan. This plan has now been adopted by the council. My Department has advertised for the appointment of selling agents for the property.</P>
      <P>In relation to the contribution for social and community uses, I propose to transfer a sizeable block of land at the barracks, comprising more than 20 acres, to Cork County Council for community purposes, on the basis that three acres of those lands be allocated to Ballincollig GAA Club and a further appropriate area to Ballincollig Soccer Club. It is considered that the mechanism for the transfer of the lands to the two clubs can best be developed at local level by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council will also be in a position to provide an extended area of public parkland from the <Col N="1028" /> block of land referred to above and will, in addition, be given land comprising six and three quarter acres occupied by the sewage works. This brings the total lands being handed over to the local authority to almost 20% of the overall area of the barracks property and, in those circumstances, it should be possible for the needs of all local sporting and community interests to be met from that body of land. As the Deputy will be aware, further blocks of the Murphy Barracks property will be provided to meet additional local needs, including sites for healthcare facilities and a Gaelscoil. This will further increase the considerable benefits accruing to the community of Ballincollig as a whole from the disposal of the property and meets commitments given in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required. I launched the Defence Forces 2001 general service recruiting campaign in March 2001, which was followed by national and local media advertising. The 2001 annual cadet competition was successful in recruiting some 64 cadets for the Defence Forces. Special &ldquo;direct entry&rdquo; competitions are also held from time to time in order to recruit prequalified personnel for specialist technical appointments. To date in 2001, 17 officers have been appointed from such competitions. &ldquo;Direct entry&rdquo; competitions for appointments for engineer officers in the ordnance corps, electrical engineers in the Naval Service and medical and dental officers in the medical corps will be advertised shortly. The annual cadet competition will be advertised early next year.</P>

      <P>Following the submission of the White Paper on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000, the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force to 10,500, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence set out a positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. In addition to the £180 million which has been invested in equipment since I was appointed Minister in 1997, the White Paper involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure over the next decade. This year alone, the provision is about £107 million. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial programmes of investment will take place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and some examples are as follows. Twenty-two of the new fleet of 40 Mowag armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing in total £40 million, have now been delivered to the Curragh Camp. All 40 vehicles will be delivered by the end of <Col N="1030" /> February or beginning of March next year, almost two years ahead of previous expectations. Negotiations are ongoing with Mowag with regard to the provision of an additional twenty APCs. There has been significant investment in new vehicles for the Army with over £6.5 million spent on specialist transport cargo vehicles, deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 × 4s, and three quarter tonne trucks.</P>
    <P>More than £10.5 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. An investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million over the next three years is under way. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces has commenced.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on this matter shortly. The second new ship for the Naval Service, <i>LE</i><i>Niamh</i>, which is a sister ship of <i>LE Róisín</i>, was commissioned into the Naval Service in September. As with <i>LE Róisín</i>, the new ship cost over £20 million and already is proving to be a tremendous asset to the Naval Service in carrying out its various roles.</P>
    <P>The new equipment programme is a top priority for me. It ensures that the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation in which people are proud to serve. The Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will have the most modern equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at <Col N="1031" /> Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth &ndash; Clancy Barracks &ndash; will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council in conjunction with the IDA for £767,000 or 973,889 has been completed. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000 or 380,921 for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million or 8,888,167. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly. In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North-Eastern Health Board for £600,000 or 761,843 and sale contracts have recently been signed. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board last year on foot of that agreement. The legal formalities to complete the sale are progressing.</P>
      <P>With regard to Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, a comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of this property. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of last year for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan. I understand that this plan has now been adopted by the council. My Department has advertised for the appointment of selling agents for the property.</P>
      <P>The vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide <i>circa</i> one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In relation to the remainder of this site, I am arranging early discussions with all interested parties, including the local authority. Clancy Barracks, Dublin, was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001. Two bids were received, one of which was from Dublin Corporation. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property, which remains on the market. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> The total cost to my Department associated with the disposal of surplus military property since July 1998 is £1.607 million or 2.041 million. Income from completed sales is £767,000 or 973,889 and income from lettings is £14,761 or 18,742. Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers, the cost of security at Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North-Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and the former Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy has been sold to Cork County Council and no further costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to either of these properties.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £1,064,000 or 1,351,001. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £171,581 or 217,863 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. No insurance costs have been incurred in respect of any of the properties as the State carries its own insurance.</P>

      <P>A military college was established at the Curragh in 1930 in accordance with Defence Force Regulations CS 3. The military college currently includes the following schools: the cadet school for officer induction training and potential officer training and the infantry school for officers, providing a junior command and staff course. In addition, this school has a number of training wings: the non-commissioned officer wing to conduct senior NCO courses &ndash; sergeant &ndash; and standard NCO courses for corporals and the infantry weapons wing for the training of weapons instructors. There is also the command and staff school for officers of senior rank and UNTSI. In 1993, the then Minister inaugurated a new constituent school, the United Nations Training School Ireland, for the purpose of formulating and disseminating peacekeeping doctrine throughout the Defence Forces and to train officers and NCOs for specific peacekeeping missions.</P>
      <P>This structure has been reviewed by military boards established by successive chiefs of staff and by Price Waterhouse in 1994-95. Current arrangements are considered satisfactory and compatible with international military standards in training and military education. Instructors of the various schools attend courses overseas in order to stay abreast of current doctrine and procedures.</P>
      <P>The military college also includes various support elements to assist the schools. These include an audio visual unit, library and language laboratory and administrative staff for logistical support. The military college is recognised as a designated institution by the Higher Education Training Awards Committee. The cadet course and specific NCO courses have been awarded diploma status by HETAC.</P>

      <P>The sheepmeat forum was established in February 1998. Its terms of reference were to evaluate the future direction of the sheepmeat sector and to assess how the industry can address existing constraints and future challenges. The forum issued its report and recommendations in October 1999.</P>
      <P>The food industry development group was established in 1998 for the purpose of formulating an action plan for the food industry in the context of a strategic approach to the future use of national and Structural Funds for the industry. The group issued its report in December 1998.</P>
      <P>The beef task force was established in November 1998 in order to devise an action plan for the development of the beef industry covering the whole sector from primary production through to processing and marketing with a view to enabling the sector to overcome the obstacles impeding its development and to generate better returns from the markets. The task force issued its report and recommendations in June 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 consultative groups were consultative groups involving representatives of various organisations which were set up in 1999 in a number of sectors, including milk, beef and cereals in advance of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The agri-food 2010 committee was estab<Col N="1035" /> lished in June 1999 with the purpose of proposing a strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food over the next decade. It reported in March 2000 and the Government's response was published in the agri-food 2010 action plan in August 2000.</P>

      <P>No record exists of any application from the named person for additional milk quota either under the scheme for the temporary allocation of quota due to restrictions caused by the foot and mouth crisis or under the milk quota appeals tribunal schemes dealing with hardship cases or animal disease. If the named person wishes to apply to my Department under these schemes he should do so before 18 January 2002. Application forms are available from his co-operative or dairy or my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a scheme for the allocation of approximately seven million gallons to certain small and medium scale active milk producers who had farm development plans in the early 1980s or whose herds were adversely affected by animal disease in the late 1970s. Application forms for this scheme are also available from my Department or from co-operatives or dairies. The closing date in this case is 31 January 2002. The person named did receive an allocation of 690 gallons last year from the additional quota available under Agenda 2000.</P>

      <P>At present, targets for the reduction of zoonotic diseases are set out in Commission Decision 92/117/EEC of 17 December 1992. Ireland is in conformity with the provisions of this directive. Ireland is one of only seven member states with an EU approved national salmonella plan and has a targeted policy of slaughtering flocks from breeding poultry and laying hens detected with strains of salmonella having consequences for human health.</P>
      <P>Discussions are currently taking place at an EU Council working group to adopt a further set of regulations to revise the measures set out in Directive 92/117/EC and deal in a more comprehensive way with the control of zoonotic diseases. Among the measures contained in these draft regulations is the use of Community targets for the reduction in the prevalence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents in poultry breeding flocks, laying hens, broilers, turkeys and breeding herds of pigs. The intention is to have these targets in place and implemented in all member states on a phased basis between the years 2004 and 2009.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, as previously stated, is already carrying out the policies necessary to achieve the existing <Col N="1038" /> target for breeding poultry and the proposed target in relation to laying hens and has supported the Belgian Presidency's proposal to adopt new targets for broilers, turkeys and breeding herds of pigs.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid £570.62 under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme on 24 September 2001 in respect of 12.68 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. This compares with his average payment of £332.33 under the old animal based headage schemes in the three years 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system, regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> Following a thorough review of the area based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare, subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> A sum of £3.4 billion is available under the CAP rural development programme for rural environmental protection, early retirement and compensatory allowances schemes. The sum of £0.47 billion is provided under the Border, midland and western regional operational programme and the southern and eastern regional operational programme for on-farm investment, diversification, general rural development and advisory services. A total of £0.3 billion is available under the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme for a full range of support measures for the food sector covering capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion and human resources. A further £0.12 billion is provided under these operational programmes for agricultural research and training.</P>
    <P>My Department plans to proceed with all the relevant measures and the vast majority of these are already being implemented as originally planned.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>the method by which tag allocations are determined for each herd owner; the reason it is necessary for a veterinary inspector to fit brass tags in the event of persons requiring extra tags before each annual quota is released; the reason these must then be replaced under supervision by a Department inspector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[30777/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual tag supply threshold for each herdowner is established by taking the number of his or her calf births in either of the previous two years, whichever is the greater, less the number of unused tags on hand and adding 10% to that figure. For autumn calvers, that is, where 50% of calves are born between 1 September and 31 December, there is no deduction for unused tags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> If a herdowner requires supplies of tags over and above his or her annual allocation, application must be made to the district veterinary office. The purpose of this is to ensure that supplies of tags are issued only in respect of genuine animals. Occasionally, when a herdowner does not have tags for an animal at the time of the annual herd test, a temporary brass tag is attached to the animal by the testing veterinary inspector for identification for animal health purposes. When the herdowner receives the additional supply of tags, he or she must apply the plastic tags to the animals in question. The temporary brass tag is left in the animal's ear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government gave a commitment for a targeted investment programme in both urban and rural disadvantaged areas. CLÁR is the programme for revitalising rural areas and is up and running since 5 October 2001.</P>
      <P>I have selected 16 areas to participate in the programme. My primary criterion for selecting areas was the greatest percentage loss of population between 1926 and 1996. These are, in general, the areas experiencing the most rural degeneration with a constant decline in population, withdrawal of services and high dependency ratios. I have also included the area which had a full cull of livestock due to foot and mouth disease recently, the Cooley Peninsula. The areas selected include parts of all the counties of Connacht/Ulster, parts of five counties in Munster and parts of four counties in Leinster. The average population loss in all these areas is 50% and the total population that will benefit from the programme is 283,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CLÁR will operate through two basic instruments, namely, the reprioritising of investments under the national development plan to ensure that these areas get priority of investments under the plan and a £20 million dedicated fund over two years, 2002-2003, to provide matching funding to Government Departments and other State agencies for special projects, including some not included in the NDP that are urgently needed for rural development. Priority will be given to co-funded projects to be undertaken by other State agencies and in the case of community development also by the local community. Particular consideration will be given to projects that provide basic social infrastructure such as care of the eld<Col N="1044" /> erly and other social services for the vulnerable groups.</P>
    <P>Special consideration will also be given to economic infrastructure, such as enterprise centres, small broadband projects and other basic infrastructure, which would have a clear benefit in terms of employment creation, thus providing opportunities to local people who otherwise would have limited employment expectations.</P>
    <P>My aim is to complete the preparatory phase of the programme by the end of this year and that investment to these areas can begin to flow in 2002. CLÁR is not a tax designation scheme and tax designation did not form part of the Government decision. It is not intended to seek tax designation for CLÁR areas.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 165 of 27 November 2001, arrangements are currently being made for the incineration abroad of the meat and bone meal, MBM, produced from the rendering of carcases purchased under the EU purchase for destruction scheme. There are no incineration facilities in this country. The quantity involved is about 35,000 tonnes and I am hopeful that the first shipment will take place before the end of this year as soon as commercial arrangements are finalised. The MBM will be stored and transported in its present form until it is incinerated.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Every REPS participant must undertake to farm to the scheme conditions and agri-environmental specifications for a period of five years as a condition of eligibility for payment.</P>
      <P>The governing EU regulation provides that when, during the period of an undertaking, all or part of the holding is transferred to another person, the latter may take on the undertaking for the remainder of the period. Where such continuation of the undertaking does not take place aid paid on the land transferred must be reimbursed. The regulation also provides that member states may choose not to require reimbursement where there is a definitive cessation of farming by a beneficiary who has already completed three years of the undertaking and it is not feasible for a successor to continue the undertaking. In all cases, a transferee may opt to continue the REPS plan of the transferor. Such an undertaking by the transferee would dispense with the reimbursement requirement.</P>
      <P>In January 2001 the REPS participant concerned transferred her land. She applied for the early retirement scheme on 30 May and her application was approved in August. While payment of the early retirement pension to the person named did not begin until August, she had transferred title to her lands by lease in January and could not therefore claim to have been in control of them thereafter. As the participant concerned had not completed three years of the scheme and the transferee did not elect to continue to farm the land under REPS, my Department has no option but to recoup all moneys she received under the REP scheme in accordance with the governing EU regulation.</P>

The scope of the work of the action team was to consider how best the Border corridor groups could contribute to decisions on spending from the new round of EU structural funds support in the Border corridor, in particular the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA CIP and the cross-Border components of the Peace II Programme. In this context, the action team was to consider the following: maximising the role of the groups to bring practical benefits to the communities on both sides of the border; the potential for a performance indicator which will optimise the outcome of spend on the Border corridor, regardless of spending authority; complementarity with existing structures North and South; complementarity of actions across related expenditure programmes, both EU and national; linkages with other district councils/sectoral representatives within the eligible area for INTERREG III and Peace II.</P>

The group monitored the study and finally accepted Arthur Andersen's reports on both funds.</P>
    <P>A secondary tax group was set up by the Department of the Taoiseach in July 1998.

The issues raised by the group are addressed in the various Finance Bills since the group was set up.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, however, the Department has chaired and provided the secretariat for a number of working groups established under Partnership 2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These include the working group to examine tax credits and standard rating and the Partnership 2000 working group on tax credits established under the former, working groups examining work related expenses and benefits and the role of refundable tax credits, and a consultative committee on employee financial participation, respectively, established under the latter agreement.</P>

The group has met on two occasions but has yet to report its findings. It is made up of representatives from the DAFRD, DH&amp;C, DE&amp;LG and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The group's first two meetings took place on 13 June and 7 August.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on Debt Policy was set up to establish an appropriate debt policy after <Col N="1057" /> EMU and included representatives from the NTMA and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Committee for Performance Awards was recommended by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector to oversee the new scheme of performance related awards for assistant secretaries in the Civil Service and certain other posts, including posts at deputy secretary level.

      <P>The tax reliefs for the areas and sub-areas designated under the town renewal scheme were provided for under section 89(a) of the Finance Act 2000. The scheme provides for capital allowances of 100% in respect of qualifying construction or refurbishment expenditure incurred on qualifying commercial buildings and capital allowances of up to 100% in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of qualifying industrial buildings. In the case of lessors, the relief is written off at 50% in year one and the remainder at 4% per annum. Owner occupiers can qualify for similar relief but can also avail of free depreciation of 50%, which allows the owner to defer writing off the year one allowance if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reliefs outlined were subject to European Commission approval in the context of State aid <Col N="1058" /> and were notified to the Commission in July 2000. Agreement was reached with the Commission in March of this year to allow the application of commercial and industrial incentives to the majority of projects under the town renewal scheme. Details of the new arrangements which are tailored to meet the Commission's requirements on State aids were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 16 March last and the reliefs were introduced with effect from 6 April 2001. In view of the delay in reaching agreement with the Commission on the commencement of the commercial and industrial elements of the scheme, the termination date of the scheme has been extended from 31 March 2003 to 31 December, 2003.</P>
    <P>Incentives are available to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that is, enterprises defined by the EU as having certain characteristics, including a staff of fewer than 250 employees, with either an annual turnover not exceeding 40 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 27 million. In detail, the range of projects that have been cleared to proceed from 6 April 2001, following discussions with the European Commission, are all new build SME projects &ndash; such projects will be eligible for both commercial and industrial incentives and refurbishment projects in the following categories: SME projects where the expenditure incurred is below 800,000 or £630,051 will qualify for the full range of commercial and industrial incentives; SME projects which involve both expenditure on refurbishment and the provision of an extension where the cost of the extension is at least 25% of the market value of the existing building &ndash; this category will also qualify for commercial and industrial incentives; local retail SME projects, excluding mail order and financial services &ndash; incentives for office and industrial development are therefore excluded under this category.</P>
    <P>Projects which qualify under any of the three refurbishment categories outlined above are eligible under the scheme. Refurbishment projects which do not fall within these categories are the subject of ongoing discussions with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Provision to allow the implementation of these arrangements was included on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001. The provision also provided that capital allowances will not apply in respect of expenditure incurred, on or after 6 April 2001, on industrial and commercial premises in designated areas under this scheme where any part of that expenditure is met by way of grant assistance from State bodies or elsewhere. This amendment was made in order to ensure that the scheme complies with the European Commission's regional aid guidelines for the period to 2006 and similar amendments were made on Committee stage in respect of the urban and rural renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>The scheme also provides for relief in respect of expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, <Col N="1059" /> conversion or construction of residential property. In the case of rented residential property, relief is available against all Irish rental income in respect of 100% of qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, conversion or construction of qualifying property. Owner occupiers can also avail of relief of 100% over ten years against all income in respect of qualifying refurbishment/conversion expenditure incurred on qualifying residential property. In the case of construction expenditure incurred on residential property, owner occupiers are entitled to relief at 50% of the qualifying expenditure over ten years against all income. These reliefs were not subject to European Commission approval and were introduced from 1 April 2000 and will run until the scheme's deadline of 31 December 2003.</P>
    <P>As indicated, the full range of reliefs available under the town renewal scheme have been in operation for less than one year. It is therefore premature at this stage to review the operation of the scheme or to ascertain the take up of these reliefs. In addition, it is also too early to give consideration to the possibility of introducing additional reliefs under the scheme and, in any event, any amendments to the business elements of the scheme would be subject to European Commission approval.</P>

      <P>In the 1998 and 1999 Finance Acts, I provided for capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction, extension or refurbishment of buildings used as private registered nursing homes and convalescent homes. Expenditure incurred on the conversion of an existing building into such a nursing or convalescent home also qualifies.</P>
      <P>The capital allowances are available, at the rate of 15% per annum for years one to six and at 10% in year seven, for expenditure incurred on or after 3 December 1997 in the case of nursing homes and for expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 in the case of convalescent homes. Individual passive investors may only offset a maximum of £25,000 per annum of these allowances against their non-rental income. The nursing homes and convalescent homes in question must be registered with a health board in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The buildings which qualify for the capital allowances must be used as nursing homes or convalescent homes for at least ten years, otherwise there will be a clawback of the capital allowances granted in the form of a balancing charge.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has no record of having received an application for a refund of income tax from the taxpayer. The inspector's records indicate that the taxpayer had two employments during the current tax year. On the basis of her earnings from those employments, and assuming she does not take up employment again before 31 December 2001, the inspector has calculated that the taxpayer is due a refund of £703.01 or 892.64. A cheque for this amount is in the process of being issued.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant inspector of taxes has no record of having received a claim from the taxpayer in question for tax relief on his private pension contributions. The inspector does not, therefore, have enough information to determine whether or not the taxpayer may be entitled to arrears of tax in respect of such contributions.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, a taxpayer is entitled to claim tax relief on private pension contributions provided he or she is not in pensionable employment. If this is the position, the taxpayer should forward a copy of his retirement annuity contract to his inspector, together with written confirmation from his employer that his employment is not pensionable. The inspector will then be in a position to determine whether he may be due tax relief on his contributions.</P>

      <Quest>if the roll-over relief in the Finance Act, 2001 was extended in respect of farmers whose land is acquired by compulsory purchase order for roadway purposes; if the Act includes the situation where the proceeds from the land sale can be reinvested in non-farming assets.</Quest>

      <P>Roll-over relief for capital gains tax purposes has been available since the 1995 Finance Act in respect of farmland acquired under a compulsory purchase order for road construction or road widening purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for this relief, the assets disposed of and the assets acquired must be within the same class. There are two classes of assets. Class 1 is concerned with the assets of a trade, including <Col N="1061" /> farming &ndash; broadly plant or machinery, land and buildings, not being trading stock, and goodwill. Class 2 is concerned with land and buildings which are not assets of a trade. Consequently, where a farmer disposes of farmland used in the farmer's trade of farming under a CPO, an asset falling within Class 1 is being disposed of and therefore to qualify for the relief the proceeds must be invested in assets also falling within Class 1, that is, fixed assets of any trade, not necessarily the farming trade.</P>
    <P>Section 95 of the Finance Act, 2001, extended this CGT relief to all land and also extended the time frame within which replacement assets must be acquired for the relief to be available.</P>

      <P>A competition for the post of prison officer in the Irish Prison Service was advertised on 27 September 2001 and 3,456 applications were received.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commissioners agreed that a trial system of application by telephone could be piloted for this competition to facilitate smoother operation for both the candidate and the Civil Service Commission. Inadvertently, 125 applications were accepted from candidates who were outside the age limits and on 7 November 2001 invitations to attend the written tests issued in error to these applicants. This came to light before the tests were held and these applicants were then contacted by letter on 9 November 2001 and advised that as they did not satisfy the requirements of the competition, they could not be deemed eligible for these posts, so there would be no point in their attending the testing stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age limits, along with all the other requirements for the competition, are specified in the statutory competition regulations made by the Civil Service Commissioners under section 16 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956. In this instance candidates were required, on 1 October 2001, to be at least 19 years of age and under 35 years of age. As these regulations are statutorily binding, it is not possible to accommodate applicants who do not meet these requirements at later sittings of the test stage of this competition. The Commissioners have a policy of reviewing all <Col N="1062" /> elements of recruitment processes which will include, in this case, the pilot system for accepting applications by telephone.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the derelict sites levy which was introduced by the Derelict Sites Act, 1990. This Act provided for more effective arrangements to prevent land dereliction through the consolidation of the existing law on dereliction and included a provision that owners of derelict urban land must pay a levy based on a percentage of the market value to the local authority in whose functional area the land is situated. This, I might point out, is a levy charged and collected by the relevant local authority and not a national tax whose proceeds are paid into the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for public policy in the telecommunications sector, including broadband, rests with the Minister for Public Enterprise and various initiatives are under way at present to facilitate the development of broadband infrastructure through funding provided under the national development plan. In the circumstances, I do not consider that the measure proposed, which would have no parallels within the tax system, would be suitable.</P>

VAT applies at the standard rate on all new motor vehicles in each EU member state. This ranges from 15% to 25%, with Ireland having a standard rate of 20%. There are no plans to harmonise the rate of VAT applying to motor vehicles in the EU.</P>
      <P>EU member states in many cases apply various other taxes at varying rates to vehicles, based on registration or other criteria.

    <P>Comprehensive information regarding State bodies that are not included under the first schedule is not held in my Department. In order to be helpful to the Deputy, I have included a list of bodies under the aegis of my Department that are not included in the first schedule and I have asked my officials to request other Departments to supply the information requested directly to the Deputy. This list does not include subsidiary organisations and groups such as the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and the committee on top level appointments in the Civil Service whose records are deemed to be under the control of my Department and, therefore, accessible for FOI purposes.</P>
    <P>No State bodies are excluded from the FOI Act as such. Rather, the first schedule sets down criteria under which additional public bodies may be prescribed in regulations. The process of extending FOI in this way has been incremental. When the Act came into force in April 1998, it initially applied only to Departments and offices and to certain closely related bodies. Since that time, the Act has been extended gradually as experience has been gained in its application. In October 1998, it was extended to health boards and to local authorities. One year later, it was further extended to certain statutory agencies in the health sector, publicly funded voluntary hospitals and voluntary organisations which provide substantial public mental health services or services to persons with an intellectual disability. During 2000, the Act was extended to bodies in the broadcasting sector including RTE and TG4, to bodies in the environment, social services, cultural and regulatory fields and to certain bodies providing services to persons with a physical disability. This year has seen further extensions to bodies in the enterprise-support area, such as IDA Ireland, Forfás, Enterprise Ireland, etc., and third level education, including universities, institutes of technology and colleges of education.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to further extending the FOI Act. Earlier this year, it decided, in principle, that the Act should be extended to cover remaining public bodies by no later than end 2005, subject to examination on a case-by-case basis and commencing next year.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 25 and 33 on Wednesday, 28 November last, which set out the general position as regards implementation of the national development plan. The question of the scheduling of specific projects under the NDP is a matter for responsible individual Departments and implementing agencies taking account of NDP objectives and available resources. I understand that the Deputy has put down a separate question to individual Ministers in this regard.</P>
      <P>The only elements of the plan for which my Department has direct responsibility is the technical assistance operational programme. There has been no slowdown in the implementation of this programme arising from the downturn in the economy. The commissioners have a policy of reviewing all elements of recruitment processes which will include, in this case, the pilot system for accepting applications by telephone.</P>

      <P>The review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, which was established in 1969, is an independent standing body whose primary function is to advise the Government on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to higher public ser<Col N="1072" /> vants, Civil Service, local authorities, health boards, non-commercial State bodies, Garda Síochána, Defence Forces, hospital consultants etc., members of the Judiciary, members of the Oireachtas and other political office holders. Consequently, its recommendations set the remuneration levels for top posts across all arms of government of the State. In doing so it takes account of the differing responsibilities and tasks applying to each of the posts being reviewed and recommends salaries based on these weightings in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
      <P>In line with the established Government policy of accepting the recommendations of this independent review body, the Government decided to accept and implement the recommendations in report No. 38. In relation to a number of posts, the review body recommended a rate of pay below the current rate. The Government decided that in these cases the present holders of the posts should continue to be paid their existing salaries on a personal basis, subject to their contractual arrangements. The review body recommendations will therefore not result in a decrease in salary for the current holders of these posts.</P>

Solar panels purchased and installed by an individual are subject to the standard rate of VAT at 20%.</P>

    <P>Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, it would not be possible to introduce a 5% rate which would apply to the widespread installation of solar <Col N="1073" /> panels for all interested parties. In any event, such a change would require the introduction of a new reduced rate and there would be pressure to extend the rate to other goods and services covered by the relevant section of the Directive. I am concerned that this would in time lead to a reduction of the Exchequer revenue from VAT.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to indicate what, if any, tax measures will be proposed in the budget. Concessional arrangements for biofuels provided in earlier Finance Bills were largely unused, except in very limited trial programmes.</P>
      <P>As the cost of producing biofuels and of making them commercially viable are considerable, the current low level of crude oil prices may also discourage future commercial exploitation of such products. The European Commission recently adopted an action plan and two proposals for directives to foster the use of alternative fuels for transport, starting with the regulatory and fiscal promotion of biofuels. The action plan outlines a strategy to achieve a 20% substitution of diesel and gasoline fuels by alternative fuels in the road transport sector by 2020. One proposed directive would establish a minimum level of biofuels as a proportion of fuels sold from 2005, starting with 2% and reaching 5.75% of fuels sold in 2010. The second proposed directive would give member states the option of applying a reduced rate of excise duty to pure or blended biofuels, when used either as heating or motor fuel. Neither directive is agreed and no discussion of the tax directive has taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>In April 2001, South Dublin County Council forwarded to the Office of Public Works a report entitled &ldquo;Report on Flood Events 5th &ndash; 6th November 2000 in the River Griffeen Catchment&rdquo;. This report identified the flooding which occurred on the river Griffeen in the Lucan Village area in November 2000 as being in excess of the 100 year flood event. The severity of the flood event coupled with the lack of capacity in the watercourses and culverts in the area resulted in widespread flooding from the Griffeen river. The report contained short and medium term recommendations. The county council commenced with a number of the remedial measures recommended. The main recommendation of the report in the medium term was the development of a catchment numerical model to identify the most appropriate combination of measures to deal with flooding in the area and to identify the requirements for the continued development of the catchment in line with proposed development strategies. The results of this hydraulic modelling are now available and are included in documentation which the Office of Public Works has received from South Dublin County Council during the last few weeks. The documentation outlines the county council's proposed works on the river Griffeen in the Lucan village area. The council has now requested the support of Office of Public Works with respect to financial contribution towards the cost. Flood relief works for the Griffeen are currently not in the Office of Public Works programme of flood relief schemes and provision for such is not included in the Office of Public Works's multi-annual estimates. Nevertheless, the Office of Public Works will be meeting with South Dublin County Council in the near future to offer advice and assistance. It has to be noted that significant additional information such as a cost benefit analysis and environmental impact study would be required to determine if a flood relief scheme for the Griffeen is feasible.</P>

      <P>The green area in question at Sidmonton Court, Bray, became vested in me, as Minister for Finance, under Section 28 of the State Property Act, 1954, upon the dissolution of Durkan Brothers Limited, later known as DB (Dublin) Limited, the company which developed the Sidmonton Court estate. Unlike the roads and other open areas within the estate the green area in question was not taken over by the local authority. An application was received for a waiver in respect of a small portion of the green areas in order for the applicant to gain assess to an adjacent site purchased by the applicant for the purposes of building a house. From a legal point of view the Chief State Solicitor recommended that a right of way over the green area be given in this case under section 31 of the State Property Act, 1954. This recommendation was accepted by my Department and submitted to the Government contracts committee which approved the decision.</P>

An important pointer to labour competitiveness developments is afforded by comparing actual and prospective changes in nominal earnings here and abroad, adjusted for differences in output per worker.</P>
      <P>For international comparison purposes, we use various sources of data, for example, EUROSTAT and the OECD. Tables 22 and 24 of the recently published European Commission forecasts for the member states provide estimates for both wages and output per worker. The change in unit labour costs which one might derive from these projections as adjusted for exchange rate considerations are one indicator to prospective competitiveness developments.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the decision taken by the school in question to close the special classes for children with autism. Many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. The Deputy will be aware from previous information given to this House of the short, medium and longer term measures which I and my colleagues in Government are taking to address this issue. My Department has also asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. It is a matter for each board and the authority to decide on the measures which it might take in this matter.</P>

      <P>One of the objectives of the new health strategy is to develop a system which has the capacity to deliver timely and appropriate services. Under this heading, action 58 of the strategy outlines plans to provide responsive and high-quality maternity care. Models of maternity care are changing with increasing demands for choice with regard to type of care and location of birth. In recognition of the changing needs and pressures on existing services, a working party will be established to prepare a plan for the future development of the maternity services. The objective will be to ensure that maternity care in Ireland is: woman-centred; equitable across different parts of the country; accessible to all; safe; accountable. The target date for the establishment of the working group is 2002, and it is expected to submit its report by the end of 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strategy for nursing and midwifery in the community is being developed at present under the auspices of the primary care strategy. This will address the deficits in the current system by providing a plan for the integration of nursing and midwifery services within primary care. This <Col N="1082" /> strategy will build on the existing diversity of nursing and midwifery competencies, currently provided by public health nurses, practice nurses, general nurses, midwives, community mental health nurses and others. The strategy will seek to maximise the use of nursing-midwifery competencies in the provision of a needs-led, high-quality and sustainable primary care service.</P>
    <P>It will also consider the potential for the role of the clinical nurse specialist-clinical midwife specialist and advanced nurse practitioners-advanced midwife practitioners as members of the primary care team, in line with the guidelines developed by the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery. The target date for publication of the strategy for nursing and midwifery in the community is the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>My Department's plans to introduce enterprise liability as the basis for providing professional indemnity cover for doctors and insurance cover for health boards and hospitals in July 2002 should address the issue of meeting the cost of claims arising from litigation. The &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; advisory group is also examining the possibility of introducing a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for infants who suffer brain damage at, or close to, the time of birth. This small group of claims generates the high cost settlements which are pushing up indemnity and insurance costs. Action is also being taken to deal with the underlying incidents which give rise to claims. Most health boards and hospitals have appointed risk managers who help identify and reduce the risk factors which contribute to the occurrence of adverse events. Several hospitals have appointed specialist risk managers to their maternity units.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have been informed of proposed changes to the EU directive governing the education and training of general nurses and midwives. The current sectoral directive prescribes three methods for the training of midwives within the European Union. It stipulates the hours of <Col N="1083" /> theory and clinical practice necessary for mobility within the European Union.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed changes, a general systems directive would place the onus on the individual member states to ensure that midwives entering their jurisdiction have qualifications comparable to those trained domestically. In effect, there would be a requirement on the national administrations to set the minimum standards for the practice of midwifery in their area. In the long-term, these proposals could conceivably have implications for the recruitment of midwives from abroad. However, it must be stressed that the changes are presently up for discussion in the member states and that An Bord Altranais has indicated its opposition to them.</P>

      <P>The number of children on waiting lists includes those children waiting for assessment by the consultant orthodontist. Not all children on the assessment waiting lists will require treatment. In order to identify the number of children who would benefit from orthodontic treatment using an internationally recognised index of treatment need, a survey is being carried out. This will enable an accurate prediction of the manpower required to provide this level of care. Preliminary results from this survey will be available in mid-2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, however, that a substantial number of additional orthodontists will be required and the arrangements for training additional staff are being put in place.

Further<Col N="1084" /> more, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine.

      <P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71, as amended by Regulation (EC) 2000/83, is the co-ordinating regulation covering the referral of patients abroad for benefits in kind, including hospital treatment. This regulation requires that patients seeking hospital treatment, in a EU member state other than their own, seek prior authorisation from their competent institution, ERHA/health boards in Ireland's case, prior to receiving this treatment. The most recent European Court of Justice judgments in this area have not changed this position in that they reaffirm the necessity for a person seeking hospital treatment abroad to seek prior authorisation from the relevant health board prior to receiving this treatment.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that due to the specific nature of hospital services member states should not be precluded from restricting the free movement of patients for the receipt of health care where such restrictions can be objectively justified. The risk of seriously undermining the financial balance of a social security system; the objective of maintaining a balanced medical and hospital service open to all and the maintenance of treatment capacity or medical competence on national territory are three such objective criteria set out by the European Court of Justice. However, the court has ruled that the granting of such an authorisation must be subject to the conditions that the treatment must be regarded as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in the professional circles concerned and the person's medical condition must require that treatment. In that regard, the court has also ruled that authorisation cannot be refused on the grounds of the treatment not being &ldquo;normal&rdquo; where it is considered that the treatment concerned is tried and tested by international science. In addition, authorisation can only be refused on the grounds of lack of medical necessity where similar or equally effective treatment can be obtained without undue delay in the person's member state. Indeed, there is provision in the current regulations that authorisation may not be refused where a person cannot be given treatment within the time normally necessary for obtaining the treatment in question taking account of the persons current state of health and the probable course of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that a scheme of prior authorisation must be based on <Col N="1086" /> objective, non-discretionary criteria which are known in advance, in such a way as to circumscribe the exercise of the national authorities' discretion, in order that it is not used arbitrarily. My Department issued directions some time ago outlining the objective criteria which health boards must consider prior to referring patients abroad for treatment.</P>
    <P>Referral of patients to countries outside the EU are outside the terms of the Regulation (EC) 1408/71. Referrals to the United States, for example, will not be affected by these judgments and will continue to be made based on the Department's directives, as mentioned above.</P>
    <P>The contracting out of cases to other EU member states, primarily the United Kingdom and the United States, has been a facility used by health boards. These contracts are outside the terms of Regulation (EC) 1408/71.</P>

      <P>I accept that obstetric services at the Dublin maternity hospitals are experiencing service pressures. A number of factors have been identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, as contributing to this pressure.</P>
      <P>The number of births in the eastern region has increased from 20,646 in 1996 to 22,813 in the year 2000 with a further increase expected in 2001. A further contributory factor to the current pressures is the level of referrals from outside the regions. The ERHA advises that 10% of the workload in the Dublin hospitals relates to women from outside the region. The ERHA has recommended to the Dublin maternity hospitals that, in general, referrals from outside the region should be based on an assessment by a consultant in the women's own region that such a referral is warranted on clinical grounds.

      <P>I accept that obstetric services at the Dublin maternity hospitals are experiencing service pressures. A number of factors have been identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, as contributing to this pressure. The number of births in the eastern region has increased from 20,646 in 1996 to 22,813 in the year 2000 with a further increase expected in 2001. A further contributory factor to the current pressures is the level of referrals from outside the regions. The ERHA advises that 10% of the workload in the Dublin hospitals relates to women from outside the region. The ERHA has recommended to the Dublin maternity hospitals that, in general, referrals from outside the region should be based on an assessment by a consultant in the women's own region that such a referral is warranted on clinical grounds. The ERHA is also contacting other health boards with a view to facilitating women to access maternity services in their local areas in keeping with a policy of regional self-sufficiency. However, services will continue to be provided for patients living outside the region who require access to specialised obstetric services.

My Department has made inquiries of the board in relation to bed numbers in the Sacred Heart Home and has been informed as follows: the bed capacity in St. Patrick's unit has been reduced from 48 to 24 due to serious structural problems. From the total of 200 beds being provided in the home's other units, approximately 13 beds have been withdrawn from service, on a temporary basis, due to serious difficulties being experienced in the recruitment of nursing staff.</P>

Furthermore children requiring dental treatment under general anaesthetic are treated at some of the board's general hospitals. The board occasionally refers patients with special needs who are medically compromised for treatment to Cork Dental School and Hospital and the administrative officer of that hospital has informed me that ten patients from the SEHB were referred to it in 2001 for restorative treatment under general anaesthetic.</P>

The three health boards in question, the North-Western Health Board, the Western Health Board and the Southern Health Board, pay this allowance under the Local Offices (Irish Language) Regulations, 1966, which entitles an officer fulfilling the conditions outlined in the circular to an additional remuneration not exceeding 7.5% of the rate per annum of the annual basic salary of the post holder. The number of personnel who are in receipt of this allowance in the years 2000 and 2001 for the boards are as follows: North-Western Health Board &ndash; 20 people for the both years in question; Western Health Board &ndash; 42 and 41 people, respectively, for the years 2000 and 2001; and the Southern Health Board had two people availing of this allowance over the two years.</P>

The report emphasised that the treatment of ADHD/HKD is an integral component of the provision of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service and recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service throughout the country as the most effective means of providing the required services for this group. The recently published health strategy, &ldquo;Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You&rdquo;, includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard parity criteria whereby retired nurses benefit from adjustments made to the salaries applicable to the grades in which they served before their retirement continue to apply.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the senior staff nurse post, and to red-circled allowances payable to deputy nursing officers, theatre-night sisters and public health nurses. The senior staff nurse is a new post created as part of the 1999 nurses' pay settlement. Staff appointed to these posts will benefit from the rate for the post on retirement.</P>
      <P>With regard to the red-circled allowances referred to above, these allowances only apply to nurses who were in employment on the effective date (16 November 1999). As pensionable allowances are only taken into account at retirement where (a) actual monies have been paid, and (b) contributions in respect of such payments have been made to the superannuation scheme, it follows that these allowances cannot be applied to pensioners who retired before the effective date. My Department has confirmed with the Department of Finance that this approach is consistent with public service pensions increase policy.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. There are no plans to extend the scheme to include Crohn's disease, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>The Deputy correctly points out that the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, identifies the need that eligibility for health and personnel social services be clearly defined. The guidelines for entitlement to medical cards will be simplified and clarified. In line with the recommendations of the recent review of the medical card system commissioned by the chief executive officers under the programme for prosperity and fairness, this will ensure an improved, open and consistent framework for assessing eligibility for medical cards in all parts of the country. The health boards executive will monitor and evaluate medical card guidelines across the country and reduce as much as possible the need to exercise judgment on individual cases outside the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report on the nursing home subvention <Col N="1101" /> scheme, the Ombudsman has drawn attention to the uncertainty surrounding the eligibility of older people for long-term residential care. Clarification of entitlement in this regard will be given particular attention in the general review of legislation on entitlement referred to above. Emphasis will also be placed on implementing a standard approach to dependency assessment and the payment of subventions in each area of the country.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90 &ndash; 114.28, £120 &ndash; 152.37, £150 &ndash; 190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, namely, medium, high and maximum, which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase, and were introduced on 1 April 2001. Any decision to further increase rates will be considered in the context of the ongoing discussions on funding for the health services in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations <Col N="1103" /> are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance. As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. As indicated in the national health strategy, the nursing home subvention scheme will be amended in line with the principle outlined in the expenditure review and proposals in relation to this will be brought forward in due course.</P>

In the first year of admission, such patients would have to <Col N="1104" /> pay 33.01 for the first ten days, as the charges for in-patient services do not start until after 30 days. However, the 33.01 is not payable in subsequent years if they are still paying under the other regulations; and persons receiving services in respect of prescribed infectious diseases.</P>

A survey conducted some years ago indicated an approximate level of ownership of one in five persons, which would suggest a dog population of 750,000 approximately. In 2000, the latest year for which statistics are available, a total of 158,200 dog licences and 206 general dog licences were issued. I have no proposals to introduce compulsory microchipping for all dogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 281 and 293 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics regarding the total number of road accidents are published by the National Roads Authority in their annual road accident facts reports. The reports, which are compiled from information supplied by the Garda Síochána, are available in the Oireachtas library. The latest year for which figures are available is 2000. These reports, however, do not include details of accidents in which drugs were a contributory factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 49(1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that it is an offence to drive or to attempt to drive, or have the intention of so doing, a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle. Intoxicant includes alcohol and drugs and any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol. A person who is convicted of an offence under that subsection shall be liable to the payment of a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, provides that the level of the maximum fine for this offence will be increased to 2,500. In addition to a fine or a term of imprisonment, a <Col N="1106" /> person convicted of this offence will be disqualified for holding his or her driving licence for a minimum period of two years in respect of a first offence and four years in respect of a second or subsequent offence.</P>
    <P>The Government Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002 recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol. Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments. To advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, my Department has pledged an additional £200,000 to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, over 2000 and 2001 for a two-year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens. Preliminary findings of this programme were made available last year by the MBRS. These findings are based on samples submitted to the MBRS between 1 July and 31 December 1999, which proved to be under the legal limit for alcohol. Within this sub-set of samples, further MBRS analysis screened some 37% as being positive for drugs, the most common being cannabis.</P>
    <P>These early findings underline the Government's view expressed in the road safety strategy that drugs and driving is an issue of growing concern. While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the research programme when completed will, along with other international analysis and research in this area, inform the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and possibly changes to existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 299 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> The main threat to water quality in Ireland is eutrophication due to excessive inputs of phosphorus from various sources. The most recent comprehensive report on water quality from the Environmental Protection Agency relates to the period 1995-97 and indicates that 73% of such phosphorus inputs arise from agriculture, 15% from urban waste water treatment plants and rural households and 12% from other sources.</P>
    <P>The total phosphorus content of domestic detergents was estimated at some 2,100 tonnes in 1996. Prior to the introduction of phosphate-free detergents, domestic laundry detergents contributed an estimated 35-40% of the phosphorus influent to wastewater treatment plants and septic tanks. The quantity of phosphorus entering water from such sources is continuously being reduced by the phasing-out of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents and by the major programme of investment in waste water treatment plants by my Department and local authorities, including the provision of phosphorus removal facilities where warranted.</P>
    <P>In December 1999 I signed a voluntary agreement with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association, IDAPA, for the effective phasing-out of the marketing by IDAPA members of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergent products in Ireland. IDAPA members supply some 90% of the domestic laundry detergents marketed in Ireland. The agreement provides for an incremental approach with targets as follows: by 30 June 2000 55% of market share to be zero phosphate; by 31 December 2001 90% of market share to be zero phosphate; and by 31 December 2002 95% of market share to be zero phosphate.</P>
    <P>In May 2000, IDAPA merged with the Irish Cosmetics and Toiletries Association to form the Irish Cosmetics and Detergents Association &ndash; ICDA. Sales figures indicate that 73% of market share for the period 1 July to 31 December 2000, was zero phosphate. This compares with a figure of just under 51% for the preceding 12 month period and constitutes a significant and ongoing industry response to my Department's comprehensive strategy to tackle eutrophication of Irish rivers and lakes. In response to the ICDA commitment to the elimination of phosphate-based detergent products, my Department is liaising with the non-ICDA suppliers in relation to the remaining 10% of the market with a view to obtaining similar commitments for the &ldquo;own-brand&rdquo; sector. Significant progress is being made in this regard. Given the continuing and rapid phasing-out by industry of phosphate-based detergents, I have no proposals to launch a public awareness campaign in the matter.</P>
    <P>The estimated average disposal of phosphorus into water systems from a single wash using commercial washing powder will vary depending on the type and quantity of detergent used. My Department does not have precise information on the estimated number of washing machines used on a daily basis.</P>

      <P>Section 246 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the making of regulations relating to fees payable to planning authorities. Such regulations may provide for the payment to planning authorities of fees in relation to the making of submissions or observations in respect of applications for permission. Under draft regulations which I am now finalising, a fee is proposed to be charged to all persons, other than the applicant or prescribed bodies, who make a written submission or observation on a planning application. The fee is intended to contribute toward the enhanced service to be provided by planning authorities to persons who make submissions, as required under the new Act and the regulations. I have repeatedly emphasised that this charge would not be set at such a level as to deter any person or body who has genuine concerns in relation to a planning application. Therefore, the proposed fee is being fixed at 20.</P>

Of the total planned investment, approximately £19 billion &ndash; 24 billion &ndash; is for infrastructure programmes coming within the remit of my Department, including national and non-national roads, water and waste water, housing, waste management and urban and village development.</P>
      <P>Satisfactory progress is being made by local authorities and the National Roads Authority on the implementation of these programmes. Expenditure on these programmes in 2000 amounted to £1.75 billion &ndash; 2.222 billion &ndash; which was in line with NDP targets. Good progress is continuing so far in 2001; provisional figures indicate that combined expenditure to the end of September 2001 on national roads, housing and water services amounted to £1.237 billion &ndash; 1.571 billion. A Supplementary Estimate involving additional gross spending of £213 million &ndash; 270 million &ndash; has been introduced and the following capital services will benefit: national roads £95 million &ndash; 121 million &ndash; and water services £63 million &ndash; 80 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abridged Estimates for my Department for 2002, launched on 15 November, provide for an expenditure increase of 8% in 2002 by my Department over the 2001 revised Estimates provision. Taking account of the already unprecedented volume of investment in major NDP programmes, this increase will ensure a continuation of activity at a high level under these programmes. In the housing sector, the 2002 provision will ensure that local authority housing completions next year will increase by over 1,000 on the 5,000 completions projected for the current year. The voluntary housing sector will benefit from a ramped-up provision, and will receive an additional 5 million for its programmes. The housing regeneration projects for local authorities, notably Ballymun, will also see enhanced investment levels &ndash; increased by over 10 million &ndash; in 2002. The special programme for hous<Col N="1113" /> ing aid for the elderly will also receive an increase next year.</P>
    <P>The provision for the national roads network improvement programme will allow the ambitious construction and improvement programme set out in the national development plan to continue. Allied to this, the maintenance provision for the national network will be increased to an all-time record level. The non-national network &ndash; which is being restored as part of a ten-year programme &ndash; is also set to benefit from increased investment. The Dublin Transportation Office's capital spending for traffic management measures will increase by almost 20%. Spending on the water supply and waste water treatment programme will also be maintained at a high level. The overall provision reflects the continuing emphasis on delivery of the necessary water and sewerage infrastructure over the NDP period.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the Minister for Finance has also indicated that he will be bringing forward additional measures to support NDP infrastructure programmes in the forthcoming budget. This continuing high level of capital investment reflects the Government's commitment to the implementation of the NDP, in particular the infrastructure elements of the plan, which are crucial to future competitiveness and social progress.</P>

      <P>Under the shared ownership scheme, applicants are required to purchase at least 40% of the value of the dwelling and to rent the remaining share from the local authority. Under <Col N="1114" /> the current terms of the scheme applicants receive the full value of capital repayments which are offset against the purchase price. A rental subsidy is also payable to lower income applicants which substantially reduces the amount of rent payable. The offsetting of rent payments against the purchase price would be contrary to the principle of the shared ownership scheme which is designed to enable persons who cannot afford full purchase initially to part purchase and part rent their dwelling. I have no proposals to introduce an amendment as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In its 1995 report, the task force on the Travelling community considered that all types of accommodation, including permanent halting sites, should be made available to Travellers. The task force recommended the provision of 3,100 units of accommodation, incorporating 900 standard and group houses, 1,200 serviced bays on permanent halting sites and a network of serviced transient halting sites providing 1,000 bays throughout the country to cater for the normal patterns of movement of Travellers, otherwise than as their normal place of residence. Following consideration of the report the Government, on 26 March 1996, adopted the national strategy for Traveller accommodation incorporating the principal recommendations of the task force in relation to Traveller accommodation.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the national strategy are supported by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998. The Act required all the major housing authorities to adopt and implement five year programmes for the accommodation of Travellers in their area. The Act requires relevant housing authorities, when assessing the housing accommodation needs of Travellers under section 9 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1988, to make an assessment of the need for halting sites, including transient sites, to accommodate Travellers. The memorandum on implementation of the Act, issued by my Department in November 1998, advised local authorities that their assessment of need must relate to a range of accommodation options, including standard and group housing, permanent halting sites and transient halting sites, as specified in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 Act requires local authorities to include in their programmes measures for imple<Col N="1115" /> mentation of the programmes, including the provision of the range of accommodation required to meet the accommodation needs which have been identified. The provision of halting sites is not therefore necessarily related to housing Travellers in settled communities or new estates but rather one element in a range of responses to meet the accommodation needs of Travellers according to their preferences. All relevant housing authorities concerned have identified a need for halting site accommodation.</P>

      <P>My Department's annual review of the construction industry Review 2000: Outlook 2001-2003, which was published recently shows that the volume of building output grew by 6% and reached a value of almost £14 billion in 2000; the growth in the volume of building output will moderate to almost 3% in 2001 and will reach a record value of over £15 billion in value by the end of this year; that continued growth in building output is projected at 3% in both 2002 and 2003; and building unemployment remains low &ndash; 3.6%.</P>
      <P>The numbers employed in construction have also increased significantly with the total numbers employed in construction up by 66% in the period 1996 to 2000. There were almost 166,000 employed in the sector at the end of 2000, with over half of these employed in the housebuilding sector. There has been a high volume of construction activity under the national development plan.

Output for the first nine months of this year is up over 4% on the same period last year.

    <P>In addition Dundalk Urban District Council indicated that a further 100 rented dwellings had partial central heating.</P>
    <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 667 of 3 October 2001, from the Deputy, the management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. It is properly a matter for individual authorities themselves to prioritise programmes of maintenance and improvement works within these resources.</P>
    <P>Where capital funding is provided under my Department's remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated estates, the installation of central heating may form part of the works undertaken. The remedial works programme at Aisling Park, Dundalk and St. Finians Park, Drogheda included the installation of central heating. A total of some £1.4 million &ndash; 1.78 million &ndash; has been allocated to date in respect of these projects. Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to the use of their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of their local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme, to fund improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> Drogheda Corporation recently sought funding from my Department to enable them to provide central heating in 180 of their rented dwellings.

      <P>In Budget 2001, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the weekly income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. The effect of this increase ensures that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100 qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 qualifies for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
      <P>This means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes and the measures that I have introduced further enhance the qualification for this scheme. The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme and the health strategy. This strategy proposes the reform of the operation of existing schemes, including the carer's allowance, in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. The Department of Health and Children will begin work shortly with my Department to develop detailed proposals for the new scheme with a view to introduction as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance prior to commencing a FÁS scheme on 12 December 1999. The scheme ended on 23 November 2001. When the person concerned recently <Col N="1123" /> contacted her social welfare local office to apply for an unemployment payment she was informed of her option to apply for long-term unemployment assistance, which carries an entitlement to the Christmas bonus or unemployment benefit. The person concerned applied for unemployment benefit on 26 November 2001, in the knowledge that this payment does not carry an entitlement to the Christmas bonus. If she wishes to apply for unemployment assistance, she may do so. Unemployment assistance is subject to a means test and her entitlement would depend on the level of means assessed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314 and 317 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package of necessary benefits in the area of travel, electricity and telephone that ensure a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group. It is not within the scope of my Department to provide for all socially desirable items of expenditure. A review of the free schemes recommended that no further goods and services be covered by the schemes, unless their social benefit is clearly over and above that which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
      <P>With regard the issue of cable television, the Deputy might be interested to note that many private companies extend concessions to pensioners in order to increase their business usage, as part of their social aims and as recognition of the value they have received from their customers over the years. In this regard, following previous requests for concessions on the cost of cable television, my officials wrote to the cable company concerned bringing the demands for such concessions to their attention.</P>

      <P>The recent media campaign undertaken by my Department in relation to the introduction of the euro comprises an advertorial which featured in the print media and a television and radio commercial which is currently running. The advertorial campaign cost approximately £130,000 and was carried in the following newspapers: <i>Sunday Tribune, Sunday Independent, Sunday World, Sunday Mirror, News of the World, Irish Independent, Evening Herald, Star </i>and<i> Sun.</i> The cost of the television and radio campaign is approximately £108,000. The contract for this campaign was awarded to Bates Ireland Limited following a competitive tendering process.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new currency presents my Department with the major challenge of informing customers of the implications of the change. While no social welfare recipient will lose out financially when the change over occurs on 1 January next, it is necessary to ensure that all customers are aware of the change over and how it will be reflected in their payment. My Department has been working very closely with the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland to ensure that people receive as much information as possible to help them with the transition to the euro.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, authorises criminal courts to require offenders to pay compensation to their victims for any personal injury or loss suffered. The purpose of this compensation is to restore the injured party to their situation prior to the offence taking place. Accordingly, this form of compensation is similar to compensation claimed through civil proceedings. Court awards for compensation do not affect entitlement to social insurance payments, but are, in general, assessable as means for social assistance purposes. However, where the compensation relates to losses arising from damaged to stolen property and the compensation award is used by the victim to repair or replace that property, then no assessment will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the injured party decides to invest the compensation award instead of replacing or repairing the damaged or stolen <Col N="1125" /> property, then the sums involved would be treated as capital for means-tested social assistance purposes. The normal rules relating to the assessment of capital would apply to such sums, i.e. the first £10,000 is disregarded, the next £10,000 is assessed at £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, the next £10,000 is assessed at £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, with the balance being assessed at £4 weekly means for each £10,000 of capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's employment support services offers a number of options which are designed to assist and encourage long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education. The first of these is the back to work allowance scheme which encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced an enhanced version of this scheme specifically targeted at persons who had been five years or more on the live register. Persons participating in this can avail of a six week training period either on or off the job and during this period receive a top up of £35 a week in addition to their weekly unemployment payment. An additional incentive is the payment of a £200 bonus on taking up employment and a further payment of £200 on completion of six months work. The back to work allowance scheme has been highly successful since its introduction and to date almost 78,000 people, the vast majority of whom were previously long-term unemployed, have taken part in the scheme. Currently there are 32,700 participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self employment options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also administers the back to education allowance programme. This is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the work force. Courses covered under the scheme range from second level through to third level postgraduate courses of study. However, in cases where a person's choice of course falls outside the realm of formal second and third level courses for which the <Col N="1126" /> allowance is payable, he or she can avail of approved courses of education, training and development. Participants on these courses may continue to receive their social welfare payments for the duration of the course.</P>
    <P>Another key support option is provided through the Department's locally based jobs facilitators. Their primary role is to assist the long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare dependants back to work, training or further education by providing them with assistance on an individual basis to access the necessary programmes or supports which their circumstances demand. My Department's employment support services have been very successful to date in assisting people away from the cycle of long-term unemployment and back into the workforce. The services provided are constantly reviewed and evaluated to ensure that they continue to be relevant in the current labour market.</P>

      <P>Pensioners in receipt of an appropriate benefit from the United Kingdom already qualify for a fuel allowance provided they satisfy the other standard qualification criteria concerning income levels and household composition. The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to £8 per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3 per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or health board payment as set out in the table below. UK pensions qualify for this purpose and are included in the following table.</P>
      <P>A pension, benefit or equivalent payment from any country governed by EU regulations or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement is considered a qualifying payment for the purpose of the national fuel scheme. In order to qualify, a person must also satisfy a means test and live alone or with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance payments or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.</P>

      <P>Income deriving from participation in the home-help service has not, in general, been taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlement to means-tested social welfare payments. The basis for disregarding home help income originates in the fact that the service was traditionally a community-based good neighbours scheme attracting volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service and, as such, the service did not come within the realm of conventional employment. These arrangements apply to home help earnings without reference to the status of the client receiving the service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that, following the conclusion of Labour Court negotiations last June, agreement was reached on a revised overall pay structure for home helps in return for a restructured and enhanced home help service. The agreement provided for the alignment of hourly home help pay-rates with the pay-rates of other non-nursing health service employees, the payment of travel expenses, premia payments for Saturday-Sunday working and full annual leave entitlement as set out in the part-time workers agreement in the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised pay-rates were awarded on a <Col N="1128" /> phased basis of 75% from 1 January 2000, 85% from 1 July 2000, and the full rate from 1 January 2001. Accordingly, home helps now have full employee status similar to all other health service employees. In light of these developments, the current arrangements for home helps are under review.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity. A scheme along the lines envisaged by the Deputy could potentially be extremely difficult to administer and there are no plans in this regard at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companion passes are, subject to qualifying conditions, available to visually impaired and dis<Col N="1129" /> abled people under the free travel scheme. This pass allows a free travel recipient to have any one person aged 16 or over accompany them free of charge when travelling.</P>

      <P>These arrangements involve two separate elements. The carer's leave scheme covers the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. Issues in relation to this are the responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The carer's benefit scheme, which is the responsibility of my Department is intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. This is a weekly income support payment which is based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The maximum duration of the carer's benefit scheme is set at 65 weeks as it is considered that employers would experience difficulties in preserving employee's rights for a longer period. However, it is important to note that each care recipient may receive a total of 65 weeks care. This may be claimed as a single continuous period or in separate time periods. In the event of a person's carer's benefit expiring and the need for income support still existing, it is, of course, open to the carer to apply for carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for carers' benefit a person must be in full-time employment. This condition is satisfied if the person worked at least 19 hours per week in the three months prior to applying for carer's benefit. Issues surrounding the 19 hour per week requirement have recently been brought to the attention of my Department and the position is being reviewed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An oak-steel stairway is currently under construction in the castle and will be completed by the end of this year, well in advance of the 2002 visitor season. As the Deputy may already be aware, the question of fully restoring Portumna Castle was considered by the consultants engaged by my Department to prepare the draft management plan for the Portumna Estate. The consultants recommended conservation of the castle itself rather than its full restoration. The reasons for this are to avoid conjecture in any such restoration; the need to study, preserve and present the fabric that does survive; and the possibility offered by the building in its current state of creating a unique experience not to be found elsewhere in Ireland. This recommendation has been accepted by my Department and consequently it <Col N="1133" /> is not proposed to undertake further restoration works to the castle. As only work of a routine maintenance nature was undertaken at Portumna Castle during 1989, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>

Conservation management plans are not finalised until after a public consultation process but a copy of the second draft of each management plan is forwarded to Brussels to demonstrate the satisfactory progress of the preparation of each plan under the terms of the LIFE NATURE contracts with the EU Commission. This arrangement was necessitated by the long time-scale envisaged in clearing plans through the public consultation process, coupled with the ongoing requirement for EU Commission to monitor contracts to ensure they are proceeding satisfactorily.</P>

      <Quest>if she has initiated an investigation into a decision by Dúchas following the reasoned opinion of the European Commission that the reconfiguration of the boundaries of the special protection areas at Big Meadow, Athlone, to facilitate a development approved by Athlone UDC, was not justified on a scientific basis; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply dated 16 November 2000 to Parliamentary Question No. 104, in relation to the boundary adjustment of the Middle Shannon Callows special protection area. The reasoned opinion is currently being examined by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and a reply will issue shortly to the European Commission on this issue and other matters raised.</P>

      <P>My general approach to staffing this sector has been to build up resources over time to address the growing volume of work involved in safeguarding our wildlife and important habitats, including responsibilities arising in connection with implementation and enforcement of the EU habitats and birds directives and the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000. This approach has ensured that this sector is now better and more effectively resourced than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 19 posts for ecologists in Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, in the conservation science sections of national parks and wildlife. Two of these posts are currently vacant. I have sought and obtained approval for six additional posts in this area and arrangements to fill the vacant and additional posts by public competition are currently under way. Scientific work arising under our national and international obli<Col N="1149" /> gations is also undertaken by an extensive national network of field staff ranging from divisional managers to conservation rangers and including three regional ecologists. Of 118 posts allocated, there are currently seven vacancies and replacement staff are being recruited to fill these posts. The work of both the research and field staff is supported by an additional ecologist based in the heritage policy and legislation unit of my Department.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that on 31 July 2001, I signed the commencement order giving effect to provisions in the Wildlife Amendment Act, 2000, which,<i> inter alia</i>, provides for the designation of natural heritage areas, NHAs. The criteria used in selecting NHA sites are broadly similar to those applying to SACs but are not confined to a specified list of habitats and species. NHAs will conserve habitats and species listed in the habitats directive and additional habitats and species, of importance in the Irish context, as well as areas with a geological or geomorphological interest.</P>
      <P>Final designation of individual sites will take place only after the designation process is completed. The designation provisions are set out at sections 16 to 18 of the Wildlife Amendment Act, 2000. These provisions encompass public advertisement of the intention to designate a site, notification to land users and land owners of the extent, scientific interest and conservation requirements of the site, consultation with other Government Ministers and planning authorities, and opportunities for objection on scientific grounds.</P>
      <P>With more than 1,100 proposed NHAs encompassing in excess of 900,000 ha, as well as sites of geological interest newly proposed by the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Deputy will appreciate that the preparatory work will be substantial. The staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, dealing with the designation of nature conservation areas must also continue to give priority to complete the process of designating sites under the EU birds and habitats directives. Against this general background, NHA designation will be progressed on a phased basis starting next year. Having regard to the scale of the task, I envisage the process of designating all proposed NHAs will take at least two to three years to complete.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, carries out or commissions scientific surveys of habitats and species to address national conservation priorities. Localised surveys may form part of this work from time to time. In this context priority is, and will continue to be given to areas that are designated or are proposed for designation as special areas of conservation under the EU habitats directive, special protection areas under the EU birds directive and natural heritage areas under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>Among these designation categories Liffey Valley features as a proposed natural heritage area &ndash; site code 000128 &ndash; only. It is not proposed at this time to commission an audit of flora and fauna at this location. The following site synopsis is a summary of the scientific information that forms the basis for the proposed NHA status of this site.</P>

      </P>
      <P>

        </i>Site Name: Liffey Valley</P>
      <P>Site Code: 000128</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> The Liffey Valley site is situated along the River Liffey between Leixlip Bridge on the Kildare-Dublin border and downstream of the weir at Glenaulin, Palmerstown, Co. Dublin. The river meanders through low hills for much of its course through the site and forms the focus for the site itself. The Mill Race between Palmerstown and the weir at the Wren's Nest Public House is also included in the site.</P>
    <P>The river is a salmon river and there is a series of weirs along the river between Palmerstown and Leixlip. The water level in the Mill Race has dropped and the channel has been filled with vegetation in a number of areas as a result.</P>
    <P>The main terrestrial habitat included within the site is mixed deciduous woodland on fertile, limey alluvium and boulder clay, in which Beech (Fagus sylvatica is dominant in some areas. Elsewhere Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and Willow species (Salix spp.) are common and there are also some stands of Larch (Larix) and Scot's Pine (Pinus sylvestris). Tootwort (Lathraea squamaria) has been recorded on a number of tree species.</P>
    <P>The ground flora commonly includes Ivy (Hedera helix), Primrose (Primula vulgaris), Voilet species (Viola spp.), Lords-and-ladies (Arum maculatum) and Hart's-Tongue Fern (Phyllitis scolopendrium). These woodlands occur on both sides of the river and normally consist of old estate woodlands.</P>
    <P>A wet marsh occurs on the strip of land between the Mill Race and the river east of the metal bridge and west of the paint factory. This marsh is fed by seepage from the Mill Race and plant species such as Bulrush (Typha latifolia), Marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris) and Sweet-grass (Glyceria spp.) occur here. This strip of land also has rough grassland which is not regularly grazed. Much of the river bank and the banks of the Mill Race are fringed with Willow (Salix spp.) and Alder (Alnus glutinosa).</P>
    <P>The threatened Green Figwort (Scrophularia umbrosa), a species listed in the Irish Red Data Book, is recorded from a number of stations along the river within the site. This stretch of the river Liffey has the greatest number of recently recorded populations of this species in Ireland. The Rare and legally protected Hairy St. John's-Wort (Hypericum hirstutum) (Flora Protection Order, 1987) has been recorded from woodlands in this site. This species has only been recorded in Kildare and Dublin, at sites on the river Liffey, since 1970. The threatened Yellow Archangel (Lamiastrum galeobdolon), listed in the Irish Red Data Book, is also recorded from these woodlands.</P>
    <P>The section of river within the site is used by conoeists. The West Link bridge spans the valley west of Palmerstown. Recent management of woodlands at Brooklawn and Quarryvale has cleared a lot of Laurel and undergrowth. Some mature Beech have been removed in this area.</P>
    <P>This site is part of the Liffey Valley Special Amenity Areas Order, 1990. The site is important because of the diversity of the habitats within the site, ranging from aquatic to terrestrial. A num<Col N="1152" /> ber of rare and threatened plant species have been recorded from the site.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that officials of my Department have been in contact both with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the family of the detained person in relation to the possibility of the person concerned transferring to Ireland under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. The application process can take some time due to the fact that several legal requirements need to be satisfied before a transfer can take place under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they will be forthcoming, an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his or her continued detention here.</P>
      <P>These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and must be adhered to in processing each application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for an application to be considered. However, I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the circumstances of this case and every effort will be made to complete this application as promptly as is possible.</P>

    <P>Cloverhill and Midlands Prisons were not fully operational during 2000 and have been excluded from the table. The average cost of keeping an offender is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders in those institutions. These items include certain items which are fixed no matter what the number of offenders in custody, e.g. staffing numbers, light and heat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any application for temporary release is given full and careful consideration. I am advised by the director general of the Irish Prisons Service that in certain cases, including some offenders who have been convicted of drug related offences, temporary release has been granted to allow attendance at community based addiction counselling centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the prisons service and my Department are resolutely committed to tackling the problem of drug abuse in the prison system in a comprehensive way. An action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system was approved by me in 1999. It advocated a broad general approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This included the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services was central to this recommended approach which built on a medical <Col N="1161" /> policy which had been agreed between my Department and the then Eastern Health Board in this area. It sought to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community. At my request the director general of the prison service then established a national steering group for prison-based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan.</P>
    <P>In considering applications for temporary release the following factors are taken into account: would the release of the offender constitute a threat to the community; is it reasonable to grant release at the particular stage of the sentence; and has the offender engaged constructively with the relevant therapeutic services while in custody, in relation to addressing his addiction problem, and if so, what progress has been made? In this regard, the recommendations made by the therapeutic services as to the appropriate treatment required will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The overriding concern when considering temporary release is the safety of the public. The offender in question is serving a four year sentence for possession of drugs for supply and allowing for normal remission is due for release on 22 January 2003. I have reviewed his application and I am not prepared to consider temporary release for him at this stage of his sentence. His case will, however, continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 and 352 together.</P>
      <P>Non-EEA nationals who have permission to remain in the State as students are entitled to take up casual employment while pursuing their course of studies here. This entitlement came into effect in April 2001. Arrangements are being made, in consultation with the Garda national immigration bureau, to amend the stamp currently used to endorse the passports of such students so that casual employment is explicitly exempted from the general prohibition on employment. It is planned to commence replacing the old stamp early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's information note on this subject, which has been widely distributed, makes it clear that the entitlement to take up casual employment had immediate effect and was not dependent on the stamp being amended. It was considered neither practical nor reasonable to require all such students to attend again at Garda registration offices for the purpose of have their permission to remain stamps amended or to preclude them from deriving benefit from the <Col N="1164" /> new entitlement in the absence of an amended stamp.</P>

    <P>The Northern Area Health Board, on behalf of the three area health boards in the eastern region, is providing emergency accommodation for approximately 2,500 asylum seekers, the great majority of whom are either pregnant or who have given birth, at 54 properties in the greater Dublin area.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal position in relation <Col N="1165" /> to trespass, including trespass arising from unauthorised encampments, is that it is a civil wrong and, for the most part, falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. In broad terms, that civil wrong may be defined as consisting of intentionally or negligently entering or remaining on, or directly causing anything to come into contact with, land in the possession of another without lawful justification.</P>
      <P>In certain circumstances trespass may be dealt with under criminal law. The criminal law provisions dealing with trespass include a range of offences under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. The 1971 Act makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land, or remain in forcible occupation or to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation.</P>
      <P>The 1994 Act makes it an offence for a person to enter a building, or part of it, as a trespasser, or to be in its vicinity for the purpose of trespassing thereon in circumstances giving rise to the reasonable inference that such entry or presence was with intent to commit an offence or to unlawfully interfere with any property situated there. It is also an offence for any person to trespass on any such place in such manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person, and the Garda has power to direct a person to desist from acting in such a manner and/or to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner. It is an offence for any person to fail to comply with such a direction from the Garda.</P>
      <P>It is important to understand that the problem of trespass by Traveller encampments is one that involves complex social and cultural issues and is not an issue which can be dealt with by the law acting in isolation. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility both to ensure that public order is maintained and to ensure that Travellers receive equality of treatment taking into account their way of life. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has an important role to play in relation to the issue that is at the heart of the Deputy's question, that is the responsibility that is on each local authority under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, to have regard for the need for transient sites, as identified in its assessment of need, in preparing its Traveller accommodation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1998, I established a committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the Traveller community. The committee, which is chaired by my Department, is representative of Traveller interests, social partners and relevant Government Departments. At my request the issue of trespass by Traveller dealers and traders was discussed at the meeting of the committee in October last, and a subgroup of the committee has now been established to consider the matter more closely. This subgroup has already had one <Col N="1166" /> meeting and is due to meet again this week. I will keep the matter under review, in particular in the light of the outcome of the committee's consideration of the matter.</P>

      <P>In line with its terms of reference, the Commission on Liquor Licensing presented an interim report on off-licensing to me in April last. It contains a set of recommendations relating to dormant licences, under-age drinking, access to off-licences and certain related matters. I subsequently obtained Government approval to publish the interim report.</P>
      <P>The commission considered the complex issue of proof-of-age and identity cards in its interim report in the context of combating under-age drinking but did not recommend the introduction of a compulsory identity card. Instead, it recommended that the existing national age card scheme be publicised and promoted, and suggested a number of ways in which this could be done. Arising from the commission's recommendations, I have established a review group within my Department to review, together with the Garda, the operation of the current age card scheme and to make appropriate recommendations. I expect that the review group will report to me by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The national age card scheme provides that any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2, has overall responsibility for the issuing of cards. The age cards have security features, which include a hologram, incorporated into their design. I am happy to say that 46,800 age cards had been issued as of 27 November 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 358 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for a review this year by my Department of the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, in consultation with the social partners. This commitment is in accordance with section 28 of the Act, which provides for a review of the operation of the Act within not less than two years and not more than three years of its commencement on 3 December 1998.</P>
      <P>I announced the commencement of the review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, on 28 February last. My Department subsequently established a working group comprising the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority to assess and review the provisions of the Act in the light of its operation. The working group held 12 meetings and concluded the review last Thursday, 29 November. The working group report of the review is being finalised. The recommendations of the group will be submitted to Government for consideration in due course and I expect that their report will be published early in the new year.</P>
      <P>There are no statistics available centrally in relation to the uptake of parental leave. Individual employers are, however, required under section 27 of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, to keep records of parental leave taken by their employees. As part of the review of the Act, research was commissioned to ascertain the uptake levels of parental and <i>force majeure</i> leave. The researchers estimated that 6.74% of the labour force is eligible to avail of parental leave and to date, 20% of eligible employees are estimated to have taken parental leave. It was found that of those who availed of their entitlement, 84% were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, provides an individual and non-transferrable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age, except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted child. The entitlement originally applied to parents of children born or adopted on or after <Col N="1168" /> 3 June 1996. The Act was amended by the European Communities (Parental Leave) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 231 of 2000), with effect from 19 July 2000. The effect of the amendment is to extend the parental leave entitlement of 14 weeks unpaid parental leave to parents of children born between 3 December 1993 and 2 June 1996 or children born on or after 3 December 1993, in whose case an adoption order was made between 3 December 1993 and 2 June 1996; this leave must be taken not later than 31 December 2001. I am satisfied that, as amended, the Parental Leave Act, 1998, fully complies with the parental leave directive.</P>

      <P>As I said in the House on 14 November, the tourism victim support service, TVSS, receives an annual grant of IR£15,000 from Bord Fáilte and not from my Department. The TVSS forwarded an application for increased funding to me last August, which has been forwarded for consideration to Bord Fáilte which has confirmed to me recently that it is still in discussion with the TVSS. I am aware that a number of organisations, in addition to Bord Fáilte, also make contributions to the TVSS. I understand that the TVSS is now making a concerted effort to increase sponsorship and I have called on the many tourism enterprises which avail of or have access to the referral service to also consider making a contribution to the funding of TVSS activities.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract document, tender and construction. My Department's technical adviser, the Office of Public Works, evaluates <Col N="1172" /> each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the provision of the replacement pool facility for Dundrum Family Recreation Centre is that the local authority has submitted a preliminary report for the project and this is currently being examined by our technical advisers, the Office of Public Works. My officials will be in contact with the local authority when the assessment of this proposal is complete.</P>

      <P>In the case of adults granted refugee status, either long-term or temporary, my Department bears the cost of language tuition in order to assist them to participate in various aspects of our society in accordance with their needs and wishes. Such tuition is normally provided on contract and the provision is co-ordinated by the refugee language support unit RLSU, established in Trinity College with funding support from my Department's post-primary administration section. The RLSUs functions are fulfilled in co-operation with the Refugee Agency, my Department, FÁS and refugee groups.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, proposed that adult asylum seekers would have free access to literacy, English language and mother culture supports. Responsibility for policy co-ordination and funding of adult literacy provision rests with the further education section of my Department. Funds have increased for overall adult literacy provision from a base of £850,000 in 1997 to £10.677 million in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>VECs have been advised that adult literacy funds may be used to address the literacy and language needs of adults for whom English is not the <Col N="1173" /> mother tongue to the extent that resources allow. To progress matters further, an action research project with a full-time co-ordinator has been put in place in the Dublin area to assess the language and literacy needs of asylum seekers in consultation with key interests, to initiate pilot actions and make recommendations on a framework and costings for addressing future needs in this area.</P>
    <P>To date the project has undertaken research on the numbers, rights and entitlements of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland. This report, Immigration and Residency in Ireland, was published by City of Dublin VEC in March 2000 engaged in extensive consultations with refugee-asylum groups, FÁS, health board and welfare interests and educational practitioners on how best to meet needs; provided pilot training programmes in a number of locations for asylum seekers, including specific groups for women and summer programmes for unaccompanied minors; provided staff development programmes for providers on the language, literacy and intercultural aspects of provision; and established a working group to develop support materials.</P>
    <P>The primary research for this project is now complete and the results and recommendations are currently being prepared by the VEC. The final phase of this project will consist of focus groups with asylum seekers and refugees to discuss the nature of the recommendations and whether they truly address their needs. A report on outcomes from the pilot projects together with recommendations for future programme development is expected in early 2002.</P>
    <P>This project is working in tandem with that of a working group established by the Irish Vocational Education Association in this area, whose report was recently published. In addition, my Department has provided funds for the refugee language support unit in Trinity College for staff development and materials production in this area in consultation with the project and the National Adult Literacy Agency.</P>
    <P>At this stage, 22 vocational education committees have adult literacy programmes in place to cater for the specific needs of those for whom English is not the mother tongue.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have statistical information regarding accidents involving pri<Col N="1174" /> mary school pupils being transported to school by privately contracted services outside of the school transport scheme. With regard to the services provided under the school transport scheme, my Department and Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, place special emphasis on safety. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of the school transport scheme and has an ongoing commitment to highlight awareness of safety involving school transport.</P>
      <P>A wide range of checking procedures are in place to ensure safety. Regular safety promotions involving pupils, parents, and teachers, are also undertaken. Instructions to school bus drivers emphasise the importance of safety and include a special instruction to constantly remind pupils to exercise the greatest care in crossing roads when boarding or alighting from school buses. In addition, a safety notice is placed at exit doors as a reminder to pupils as they leave the bus. All Bus Éireann school buses are clearly identifiable and carry the international symbol for school children. Private contractors' buses also have a school children sign fitted to front and rear screens.</P>
      <P>The school transport scheme involves travel throughout the entire country in both remote rural areas and populous urban centres. All routes are examined with regard to the suitability of the roads for the various types of vehicle used. Safe set-down, turning and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind. In the planning of routes, road conditions, traffic hazards, and all other aspects of safety are considered. Services are monitored and, if conditions deteriorate or dangers arise, they are revised to ensure safety.</P>
      <P>In view of the safety procedures in place and having regard to Bus Éireann's very good safety record, it is considered that the presence of a person, in addition to the driver, would not significantly improve safety matters on school buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of school caretakers in the larger <Col N="1176" /> primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The question of introducing a pension scheme for caretakers employed under the 1979 scheme was explored in 1985. However, it was considered that the high age profile of caretakers at that time rendered the introduction of a pension scheme impractical. The position regarding the age profile has worsened in the interim. There are no plans at present to introduce such a pension scheme for caretakers employed in primary schools. The Deputy may be assured that I will keep this matter under review.</P>
      <P>The 1979 scheme has been superseded under the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive scheme that provides grants for primary and secondary schools towards the cost of caretaking services. The scheme by its nature is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which caretaking services are provided. Caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role regarding how they are employed. These individualised arrangements currently preclude a central superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>The funding arrangements for the VEC and C and C school sectors at second level include provision for caretaking services to schools. Pension scheme provisions apply in both sectors to caretakers.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &lsquo;top-up' grants.</P>
    <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that s/he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the Vocational Education Committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, plc, courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply <Col N="1179" /> to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <QRef>[30498/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): Since the introduction of the scheme of provisional recognition in 1996, my Department has received approximately 2,100 applications for recognition from teachers who obtained their teaching qualifications outside the state.</P>
    <P>At the most recent sitting of the examination in October 2001 the number of candidates who presented for examination was 138 and of this number, 49 were successful in completing their examination as a whole (i.e. passed the last of their four modules). With effect from October, 1999 candidates were allowed to take the scrúdú le haghaidh cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG, in four modules in order to facilitate candidates who wished to do so to attempt modules separately at different sittings. Candidates who pass in any one module of the examination are exempt from that module for a period not exceeding five years.</P>
    <P>Provisional recognition is granted to teachers for a five year period and the examinations are held twice a year, thus affording teachers ten attempts during their period of provisional recognition in which to pass the examinations. The standard required to obtain a pass in the SCG is determined by the fact that teachers in national schools must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy my Department that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to the teaching of the language itself it must be remembered that a primary teacher may have to teach pupils whose mother tongue is Irish, or who are competent users of the language. Even when teaching Irish to pupils whose mother tongue is English or another language, it is widely accepted by language teachers that, in order to be effective, the teacher needs to have a very good command of the language.</P>
    <P>I recently established a working group to review the syllabus and examination for an scrúdú le haghaidh cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. This review will involve two stages i.e. a short-term review and a long-term review. It is intended that a report arising from the short-term review will be completed by 28 February 2002 and the long-term review will be completed in the Autumn of 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of initiatives under the early literacy initiative measure have already been implemented and new initiatives are in the process of implementation. The key element of the <Col N="1182" /> literacy measure is to significantly raise public awareness of the importance of reading skills.</P>
      <P>During 2000 the national reading initiative was launched. It ran a media campaign to promote public awareness of the importance of reading. Revised guidelines for the school remedial service entitled learning-support guidelines were published in September, 2000 and were issued to every primary school. Under an initiative entitled Babies Love Books, a pack of high quality picture books was supplied to parents of children born in 2000.</P>
      <P>To develop and disseminate material to improve literacy standards, a video was made in 2000-01 to increase teachers' awareness of the approaches to the teaching of reading recommended in the English curriculum. This video will be launched next week and will be distributed to primary schools, education centres and colleges of education.</P>
      <P>A trilogy of books entitled Book Choice is in the process of publication. These books are intended to provide guidance in the selection of books for children and adults at different stages of learning to read. A copy of Book Choice for primary schools has been sent to every primary school. Book Choice for new adult readers will be launched next week and the final book in the trilogy, Book Choice for post-primary schools will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>To implement a proactive approach to preventing literacy difficulties, a number of initiatives are under way. The NCCA is in the process of devising revised procedures for the assessment of the English curriculum in the primary school. The Educational Research Centre is in the process of developing an early literacy test to ensure that children with reading difficulties will be identified early.</P>
      <P>A reading recovery pilot project began in Monaghan in 2000. Teachers have been trained in techniques to assess children's early literacy concepts with a view to taking action to prevent reading failure.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to build on the very good work commenced in 2000 with the launch of new measures in the Early Literacy Programme for 2001. These measures consist of the completion of aspects of the national reading initiative commenced in 2000; the continuation of babies love books scheme; the running of summer literacy camps for children at risk from learning difficulties; the provision of a special training programme, with particular emphasis on teaching reading to children with difficulties in this area of learning, for all learning-support teachers, resource teachers and resource teachers for travellers; additional once off grants of £150 for every learning support teacher and resource teacher for materials in association with the learning support training; the extension of the reading recovery pilot scheme to explore and evaluate new approaches to reading difficulties in children; and the establishment of a junior certificate school programme literacy strategy to address, through fresh approaches to library provision and use, the specific literacy needs of junior certificate students in selected schools.</P>

      <P>In the interests of clarity, I would point out that I did not issue any order in relation to the establishment of the model school for the deaf project at St. Joseph's. Any such action on my part would be entirely inappropriate in the circumstances of this case. The decision to admit the project in question was taken by the authorities at St. Joseph's following discussions with officials of my Department and on the understanding that the facility would provide a pre-school service for the children in question. I understand that the authorities at St. Joseph's endorsed the need for such a facility.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware that valid concerns have been raised by the staff at St. Joseph's at the manner in which the project in question has subsequently developed. In this connection, my Department has already advised the authorities at St. Joseph's that throughout its dealings with the model school for the deaf project, the focus of the discussions was solely on the development of a pre-school facility. At no stage did my Department agree that the proposed pre-school facility would be developed to cater for children beyond pre-school age or be used for other purposes. No such proposal was raised with my Department in its discussions with the model school for the deaf project and no such proposal was put by my Department to the authorities at St. Joseph's.</P>
      <P>My Department has advised the model school for the deaf project of its position in relation to this matter. I have also asked my Department's inspectorate to contact the authorities at St. Joseph's in relation to the matter.</P>

      <P>Until recently, the primary mechanism for addressing the effects of socio-economic deprivation in primary schools was the disadvantaged areas scheme which provides special teaching assistance and extra funding to schools in designated areas of disadvantage. The school in question is participating in the disadvantaged areas scheme and is benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home school liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of £30 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
      <P>I launched the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break earlier this year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, will retain their entitlements under that scheme.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March and April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £1,860 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned in respect of the 2000-01 school year. The school will be allocated a similar sum in the current school year. This funding is in addition to the £7,020 that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>

      <P>Social, environmental and scientific education, SESE, is a specific area of the curriculum at all levels in the primary school. The SESE curriculum seeks to enable the child to come to an understanding of the physical world, the relationship of humans with their environment, and the <Col N="1189" /> historical process through which that relationship has grown. The different strands of the SESE curriculum deal comprehensively, at a level appropriate to pupils of primary school age, with aspects of the human and natural environments and with environmental awareness and care. All primary school teachers are receiving in-service training in the SESE curriculum during this school year and over the next few years.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific environmental education syllabus available at national level for second level schools, aspects of environmental education are contained in a number of subjects within the junior cycle curriculum, in the transition year and in the leaving certificate programmes. The only mandatory subject that has an element of environmental education is civic, social and political education. In CSPE under one of the seven key concepts &ndash; stewardship &ndash; pupils should be aware that, as individuals born on the planet, every person becomes a temporary owner or steward entrusted or empowered with its care and maintenance, e.g. with constructive management of its finite resources. However, within the following junior certificate subjects, geography, environmental and social studies, science, home economics there are aspects of environmental education.</P>
      <P>At senior cycle level environmental and social studies is one of the recommended areas of experience in the transition year curriculum. At leaving certificate level, the recent revision of physics and chemistry syllabi has resulted in a greater emphasis on environmental education e.g. water treatment, water analysis, atmospheric chemistry, renewable and non-renewable sources of energy. The new biology syllabus will have a mandatory study of ecology. In addition revised syllabi in architectural and construction technology, engineering and home economics all contain elements of environmental education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants under the higher education grants <Col N="1190" /> scheme are a matter for the local authorities, while the vocational education committees make payments under the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>While it is the vocational education committees that assess applications under the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, the third level institutions, approved under the scheme, are responsible for payment of the maintenance grants to individual students.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme and the vocational scholarship scheme, maintenance grants are paid, in three equal instalments, as early as possible in each of the three terms of the academic year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme for commissioning psychological assessments has been operating since September 2001. My Department provided funding for this scheme with the main objective of allowing access to psychological assessments for those schools to which the national educational psychological service, NEPS, does not yet offer a service. Schools that have access to the full NEPS service such as the school referred to in the question are allowed to avail of the scheme only under exceptional circumstances. However, I recognise the disadvantaged nature of the catchment area to the school and I have asked NEPS to re-examine this particular instance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other concerns of the school in relation to the NEPS service, the management of NEPS has informed me that the school was one of the first primary schools in the country to have access to my Department's psychological service. It was included in the primary school psychological service pilot project 1990-94, and continued to receive a psychological service after the project had ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1996 the assigned psychologist was on leave due to illness and subsequently on career break. Due to a backlog of work arising from a <Col N="1191" /> number of such absences and the increasing demand for assessments, a project involving contracting of private psychologists to undertake assessments in affected schools was instituted in 1999. This particular school benefited from this project and a number of assessments were carried out there during that period.</P>
    <P>The first tranche of new psychologists in NEPS took up their appointments in September 2000 and began work in schools in November 2000. A highly experienced educational psychologist has been appointed to, and has been working in, the school since then. She has provided a full educational psychological service to the school, including a range of development and support activities as well as eight individual psychological assessments. I have no doubt that, as this excellent service continues, the concerns of the school will be met.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next 15 years. In relation to training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and an additional 25 training places in physiotherapy.  These increases are in addition to the extra number of places provided by the colleges in the last academic year in response to the request to expand provision in the light of perceived shortages.</P>

The Higher Education Authority has sought proposals from third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes, in response to the training needs identified in the report.</P>

      <P>Every year, my Department receives for examination over 1.5 million scripts, practical pieces and other test products. It is not logistically feasible to facilitate the return of this quantity of examination material to candidates and, in the interests of fairness and equity, it is not possible to return a metalwork project to a particular candidate and retain material from other candidates who took metalwork, art, engineering and other examinations.</P>
      <P>The optimum solution to the issues raised by the Deputy lies in realigning the assessment arrangements in subjects such as metalwork that generate artefacts. At present, the practical pieces in a number of subjects are examined in individual schools and consequently there are no logistical difficulties involved in returning the material. There are, however, short-term storage issues for the schools, which make it difficult to expand the number of subjects where the schools retain the material to include subjects like metalwork.</P>
      <P>I have requested my officials to review the arrangements in consultation with the relevant interests, including school management bodies, in order to progress these issues on a consensus basis.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations <Col N="1197" /> concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &lsquo;top-up' grants.</P>
    <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</P>
    <P>All four schemes have similar provisions relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be regularly <Col N="1198" /> reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department provides secretarial and other support services to vocational education committees, the main providers of post-leaving certificate courses, on a VEC scheme basis. The way in which such staffing is allocated to VEC schools and colleges is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools/education centres lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS primary and secondary school based community employment schemes come to an end. This funding is being made available to second level schools by way of increased grants under the school services support fund. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the mainstreaming of services provided under CE in respect of post leaving courses, my officials are in continuing discussions <Col N="1202" /> with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS regarding this issue. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in the education sector are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school and college based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school and college based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools and colleges means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools and colleges up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools and colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001 proposes a scheme of compensation for a particular set of circumstances. These arise from widespread public concern about abuse of children while they were in care in institutions over which the State had significant supervisory or regulatory responsibilities, in particular in orphanages, industrial schools and reformatory schools. I have previously outlined why the scheme applies to these institutions and not to other places, including ordinary schools, where children suffered abuse. I have referred to the fact that the children concerned were separated from their parents and as they did not enjoy the care and protection which children in the care of their parents normally enjoy, they relied to a significant extent on public bodies who had statutory duties to protect them. These considerations do not apply to day schools where public bodies did not have the kind of supervisory functions, powers or duties which applied in the residential institutions and the children themselves were resident with their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who as children suffered sexual abuse in schools have, however, other ways in which they may seek compensation from those who were responsible for their abuse. Amendments to the Statute of Limitations recognise that a person who suffered sexual abuse in childhood may not have been in a position, due to the abuse suffered, to take legal action against the abuser. Normally a person would only have three years from the date on which he or she attained his or her <Col N="1203" /> majority to bring such an action. The statute now provides that the normal period of three years within which a person can bring an action will not apply where the delay in bringing the action resulted from the abuse itself, for example, suppressed memories of abuse.</P>
    <P>Following an amendment to the Statute of Limitations made by this Government, provision was made for people who suffered sexual abuse and who were advised that their claims were statute barred. To assist such people in bringing claims, provision was made for a special one-year period, from June 2000 to June of this year, to allow such a person to commence actions against his or her abusers. As regards other kinds of abuse and the application of the statute, the Law Reform Commission has published a discussion document on the broader issue of limitation periods in those cases and is considering the issues further.</P>
    <P>Finally, one of the functions laid down in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, requires the commission to advise the Government on the actions that may be taken to alleviate the damage suffered by persons who were abused in childhood. The commission process is open to all people who suffered abuse in childhood, except where the abuse occurred in a family home. The commission may have views on how issues of compensation for abuse in ordinary schools can be dealt with.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in setting income thresholds for assessing eligibility for housing schemes, the Department of the Environment and Local Government is continuing to apply a 12 month income guideline for eligibility and allowing applicants qualify either on their income in calendar year 2001 or the 38 week tax year April to December 2001 grossed up to a full year; and if he will apply a similar system for higher education grants.</Quest>

      <P>My Department understands that, in relation to the short transitional tax year, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has indicated that in assessing appli<Col N="1204" /> cations for local authority housing the income for eligibility purposes will be the amount of income in the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001 or the nine month period 6 April, 2001 to 31 December 2001 annualised, whichever is the lesser.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of my Department's student support schemes for the 2002/2003 academic year, reckonable income will be based on the short transitional tax year running from 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001. The reckonable income thresholds, which will apply, will be adjusted downward from their full year value to take account of the short tax year. Income threshold details for both the full year value and the adjusted value, to apply in respect of 2002 only, will issue when the 2002 schemes are finalised.</P>
