      <P>Before we come to the Order of Business, I undertook to report to the House on the prolonged ringing of the division bells for the vote at 6.53 p.m. last evening. The bells continued to ring beyond the required six minutes due to an oversight, which is very much regretted. However, the bells cannot be heard in the Chamber and now action is being taken to augment the sound of the bells within the Chamber. This will prevent any recurrence. It is sincerely regretted that some Members were locked outside the Chamber and, consequently, were unable to vote.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 19, motion re Agreement on Scientific and Technological Co-operation between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of <Col N="3" /> Ireland (returned from committee); No. 43, Finance Bill, 2001 &ndash; Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage; No. 44, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage; No. 45, Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.00 p.m.; (2) No. 19 shall be decided without debate; and (3) the proceedings on the resumed Report and Final Stage of No. 43, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10.00 p.m. by one Question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.

      <P>The Government is continuing to frustrate the operation of this House. A Bill that passed Second Stage last December was referred to a committee. The chairperson of that committee, which is meeting today at 2 p.m., received a diktat from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government ordering him not to proceed with the Committee Stage of the Bill, for which he has no responsibility, until such time as a Bill, one of many delayed measures which this Minister has promised, finds its way to Committee Stage. Will the Taoiseach remove the diktat the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has imposed on the Labour Party's Bill to ban corporate donations, to enable an all-party committee, in full frontal review of the force of State, to discuss the matters which have been the subject of correspondence and debate in many papers over many months, so that we can resolve this issue? This matter could proceed in an orderly way today if the Fianna Fáil diktat on the Committee Stage of a Bill which passed Second Stage is removed. Will the Taoiseach give an indication in this matter?</P>

      <P>I support the position being taken by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn. We had great hopes when committees were introduced in this House that they would be an independent forum for Deputies where the three line whip would not apply to the same degree as it does in the case of the Dáil Chamber. A Bill, which has gone through Second Stage and is not replicated by any proposal being brought forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is now being frustrated in a committee. The committees were not intended to work in this fashion. I know what the Ceann Comhairle said is correct, as it always is. Technically the Minister has no right to prevent a committee from discussing anything it wishes but, in practice, the chairman involved, Deputy Healy-Rae, is taking the Minister's letter as diktat. It is intended as a diktat. The business of a committee is being frustrated by a Minister of this Government, therefore, we will not agree the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>I will certainly give an indication. It has been the practice since I have been in this House, and long before, that if a Government Bill was proceeding on an issue that is what proceeded. In this case the Electoral Bill is in the Seanad and that Bill is proceeding. In the normal course the Bill would not proceed, but it is a matter for the committee. That is the normal practice. It has always happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Taoiseach is a very busy person but he is not as well informed as he indicated on the matter about which he spoke before the vote. He stated that the Government Electoral Bill, 2000, contained similar proposals to the Labour Party's corporate donations Bill. It contains no such proposals. There are promised amendments. Indeed, so ill-informed is this Government that the Tánaiste yesterday stated she welcomed the Bill because she favours more modest amounts. She stated she had no wish to pin her colours to a particular amount and that the amounts of expenditure should be reasonably modest and that, in relation to electoral spending, the increases proposed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are the levels introduced by the Deputy's party in Government. What the Tánaiste does not realise is that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, wants to increase them by 50%.</P>
      <P>In light of the manifest confusion in Government ranks displayed here this morning, will the Taoiseach ask the chairperson of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government to disregard the veto from his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and allow Committee Stage of a Bill passed without division in this House to commence? Members of the Taoiseach's party are against corporate donations. Let us have an open democratic debate on this issue. Let it proceed and see where it goes. Why have this stifling of democratic debate because of a Bill published by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government which has no reference to corporate donations whatsoever?</P>

      <P>There is an emerging consensus in this House among all parties that corporate donations are bad for politics and should be banned and that quite low limits should be introduced for any personal donations. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to proceed on that basis, allow the Labour Party Bill to be the vehicle for the debate and let us arrive at a con<Col N="7" /><Col N="8" /> sensus to which the mood of the House is moving anyway to ban corporate donations, to limit personal donations and have declarations of everything except pretty nugatory amounts?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been indicated by me, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government that issues around electoral funding would be included in the Electoral Bill which is before the Seanad. They will be. It has been the practice of the House for as long as I can recall that a Government Bill should proceed in this manner. I agree with Deputy Noonan, as I did here two or three weeks ago, that there are issues around donations that must be and will be resolved. The Deputy is correct that the way to do so is on an all-party basis. I am glad that he has come around. I do not say that it was his view because he was not in the position, but that was the view I had agreed with Deputy Bruton last April. I take the opportunity again to call on Deputy Quinn to lift the veto in order that we can deal with the issue on an all-party basis.</P>

What I have in mind is that we would decide to ban corporate donations and limit personal donations to small amounts and that there would be full disclosure of everything except the pound notes, fivers and tenners one might receive at a church gate.

      <P>The Minister for Education and Science came into the House last night and made a very provocative speech. He certainly did not do anything to help a resolution of the difficult dispute. On the day when the school children of Ireland are at the gates of Leinster House seeking a solution and the Government has based its approach on the Labour Court findings, I draw the Taoiseach's attention to one of the final paragraphs of the Labour Court judgment. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the Court in considering this case has been conscious of the emotions aroused by the <Col N="11" /> effects of this dispute on a wide range of people and the national consequences of failure to resolve the dispute. The dispute has the potential to divide the community, the teaching profession and do irreparable damage to students taking State examinations this year. The effects on the educational process will last for many years and have enormous impact on the 350,000 in our schools.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court is stating in the final section of its judgment that the dispute must be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Court is speaking to both sides in that paragraph. There is a responsibility on the Government to commence a process in order that a settlement can be arrived at along the lines of the Labour Court judgment, but with modifications. The children who are facing their examinations are not marching on the ASTI headquarters or the Department of Education of Science, but on Dáil Éireann because they are saying to us, as elected representatives, that they want a solution and they are demanding that the Government commences a process to resolve the dispute.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is aware of the feeling on the ground this morning. The Government has been acting as a hard nosed employer. It is about time that it acted as a national Government. The Government has wider responsibilities than those of an employer. It has a responsibility in the national interest to resolve the dispute and it must take the necessary initiatives. I am aware that the Government is on the end of a greasy pole and in a difficult position. We appreciate its difficulty, but a process must be recommenced to solve the problem. It can be solved with modifications to the Labour Court recommendations which were a good attempt to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>All Members sympathise with the dilemma of pupils and their parents because they are suffering most in this dispute. That is the reason the Government met as soon as the Labour Court issued its findings. The Government would not have met last week in the normal course of events but did so to discuss this issue and to accept the measure. Within two days the Government accepted it. The Labour Court findings came out on Friday night and first thing Tuesday morning the Government accepted the Labour Court award and conditions in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not an award. It was a recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an award as I understand it. It was a recommendation stating there was a sustainable case if the process was followed&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and a sustainable case would lead to the teachers' unions reaching a satisfactory outcome.</P>
      <P>Those recommendations also included a teachers' forum to address the issues that have changed teaching since 1964 such as the management and supervision of schools as well as structures and lay involvement, all of which have changed fundamentally in the last 37 years. The Labour Court recommended that a non-paid forum should look at these matters to introduce fundamental change in these areas. The Government also accepted this.</P>
      <P>I understand Deputy Noonan having to raise these issues. He might say the Labour Court told us the Government should accept this, and that as Mr. Pomphrett, the facilitator, requested, this should be put to the membership of the ASTI. Unfortunately the ASTI did not consider that.</P>

      <P>As I said yesterday, the industrial relations machinery of the State is something everyone in the House would adhere to, whether that is the conciliation and arbitration scheme, which has already been rejected by the ASTI or, <Col N="13" /> without going through all the intermediate steps that have also been rejected, the Labour Court recommendation. At no time since last Friday week has anyone from the ASTI asked for clarification on any aspect of that on the airwaves, in the print media or in a direct approach to a member of the Government. If the ASTI wants to adhere to the industrial relations machinery of the State I and my excellent Minister for Education and Science are ready and willing to assist it, as Deputy Quinn has asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about what is happening to 120,000 students this morning. They feel they have been let down, principally by the Government, and their representatives will be at the gates of Leinster House. It is not good for civil society when the children of a country are demonstrating outside the gates of the national Parliament. That is very bad.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court has come a very long way. It has recommended on the five stop days; it has recommended a forum on education on the wider issues; and it has maintained that the teachers have a sustainable case for a significant pay increase. However, the Taoiseach and the Minister know that because the teachers walked out of PPF on the benchmarking issue they have not been given the opportunity to put the recommendation to their members. The Taoiseach should say this morning that he is in favour of further clarification of the judgment by the Labour Court and that he would be involved in bilateral talks to position it. The sides are not that far apart but because of the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, with the Minister for Education and Science digging a bigger hole for everybody last night, the Taoiseach should make some approach of a bilateral nature. He should recommence the process whereby the Labour Court, as it has done in the past, can clarify some of its recommendations, particularly in relation to the exercise of benchmarking. There is a solution there because otherwise the Taoiseach is saying come hell or high water he will score a victory over the ASTI and run examinations of doubtful outcome when it comes to corrections. He has very little time left and it is a heavy responsibility for a Government to confine its activities to that of a hard-nosed employer without looking at its wider responsibilities to parents, students, teachers and the wider community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect to Deputy Noonan, that is not how it is. The Labour Court recommendation was issued last Friday week and it was for the ASTI to ask for clarification. My understanding is that in rapid time they were out on the airwaves rejecting it. I will not say how rapid it was although I know, as I do not want to inflame the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at these important issues. I do not like to see young people having to protest about <Col N="14" /> anything other than something of entertainment value to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter that deeply affects students. They are under pressure and have examinations in a matter of weeks. Many of them have done their mock examinations and have studied hard through transition year and fifth year and are now in their last months in school. They have worked out what they want from the CAO. They know the points needed and that there is pressure on them. Everyone in a responsible position, the Government, the parties in this House which know the industrial machinery of the State and the ASTI, whose standing committee meets tomorrow, knows this.</P>
      <P>The ASTI has been afforded every opportunity to process its 30% claim in an orderly manner and in accordance with the best industrial relations practice. That has been followed for a long period. Last spring I set out the Government's position. The Minister had done so many times but I did so then because I saw what was happening. The ASTI, a respected group in society, was setting out to try to get almost exactly the amount the social partners were trying to get in PPF but it wanted that in addition. The ASTI did not say it did not want the money when we paid the PPF; it did not ever say it did not want to get into that process but was glad to take the money. One must therefore come to the conclusion that it wanted the 30% on top of the 29%. The ASTI rejected the conciliation council and I accept that that is not unusual. It objected to the arbitration council, which is unusual. The arbitrator told the Government that it should pay PPF anyway and the Government did so forthwith. The Minister recommended we should do so. A facilitator was appointed and the Labour Relations Commission was available. Mr. Pomphrett, one of the most senior industrial relations officers in the State, heard the case. There were difficulties with the days chosen and those were corrected; right, wrong or indifferent, that was done.</P>
      <P>Then we moved on to the Labour Court decision. Mr. Pomphrett said both sides should go to the Labour Court and both sides accepted that so off we went. There were hearings under Mr. Flood and the court made its decision, recommending that the ASTI had a sustainable case, that a teaching forum should be set up to address issues arising since 1964 and that the issue of a down payment, the core of the ASTI case, should be taken against PPF because the Government had already paid it. I interpret that as meaning the Government should continue to pay the remaining part of PPF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All those issues have been dealt with. I do not like the idea of trying to press someone into the ground. Nobody in this House is more aware of <Col N="15" /> the history of industrial relations and Mr. Murphy and 1912. I understand all those issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am trying to do is to get the ASTI to follow the same system and process as all the other trade unions. This morning I heard a spokesperson for ASTI state on the radio &ndash; I have no wish to say anything to inflame matters &ndash; that ASTI voted last November. It might have voted on benchmarking last November but, unfortunately, we did not conclude the arrangements on benchmarking until late on the night of 4 December. Whatever ASTI voted on, it was not what we concluded on the night of 4 December.</P>
      <P>There are ways, if people seek or want them. If there are issues about benchmarking which need to be clarified, as Deputy Noonan mentioned, or about anything else in the Labour Court award or if there is anything else under the industrial relations mechanism to try to resolve this and to avoid the difficulties, this Government is ready to deal with them. However, it takes two and it is time the ASTI played its part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the future of the education system. The Taoiseach and other Members will agree that just over six years ago, when there was a different Government in office, concerns about the future of the medical profession, particularly the nursing profession, were communicated to both the Government and the Opposition. Certain predictions were made about the changes that would occur, especially with regard to the number of people coming into the nursing profession and the availability of well motivated and qualified people in Ireland. I confess I did not listen to those voices at the time as well as I might have, and the problems the Minister for Health and Children now has are, in part, related to that.</P>
      <P>The issue of education and the status of the profession of teaching, its role in society and its contribution to the Celtic tiger, as much as the concerns of the young students who will hopefully do examinations this year, is much bigger than simply saving the social partnership agreement or just considering the issue within the narrow confines of an industrial relations dispute. I agree with much of what the Taoiseach said today. He went further than his comments yesterday, while the Secretary General of the ASTI opened the possibility of clarification, elaboration and exploration against the background of a rapidly deteriorating timeframe within which decisive action can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of what has been said &ndash; I support Deputy Noonan's analysis &ndash; and bearing in mind the substantial content of the Labour Court recommendation, will the Taoiseach consider taking the initiative by inviting representatives of the ASTI to Government Buildings to explore the possibilities contained in the Labour Court <Col N="16" /> recommendation? The Taoiseach has taken such action in the past, in the context of Northern Ireland and in the context of many other disputes. We must seek a way together of finding a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>A solution can and will be found but the Taoiseach has the opportunity to take the initiative. I implore him, on behalf of the parents, pupils and the teaching profession, to take an initiative, without undermining the role of the Minister for Education and Science, to elaborate on and consolidate the explanations he has given to the House. Let the teachers' representatives and others hear directly from the Taoiseach about the prospects he sees and about the room for manoeuvre and let us, together, make some progress on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Members have direct experience of industrial relations from both sides of the table, as it were, but the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Labour, has significant experience in that area. He is well aware that the Labour Court will not intervene to clarify unless it gets an assurance in advance that the clarification it brings forward will be acceptable to both parties or at least acceptable to the degree that the union involved will put the issue to its members. Everybody who has been involved in industrial relations is aware of that fact and the Taoiseach knows it better than anybody.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach take a step to recommence the process so that an element of consensus can be put to the Labour Court in seeking clarification? That will get everybody out of the current Mexican stand-off. I urge the Taoiseach to do this today in the interests of the students outside the gates, the 120,000 students throughout the country, the stressed out parents, the teachers and the future of education. We are at one of those epiphanies in society where the decision taken in the next week or two will be crucial to the future of this country, because education is crucial to its future. I urge the Taoiseach to act and not let himself get dug into a position from which he cannot move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn will be aware that the Teaching Council Bill is on Report Stage in the House. That Bill addresses many of the important issues he refers to, such as enhancing the profession and moving it to new heights. It is an excellent Bill and is considered so by the House. That Bill will be passed and will address those issues for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teaching forum issues are also important in the teaching profession. The Minister, Deputy Woods, has been dealing with this dispute for almost 13 months and there are other issues relating to part-time teachers, why there are so many, why rosters are the way they are and so forth. The religious in many cases do not have the numbers for or have moved on from many aspects of second level education and that has changed the position and the clarity of responsibility with <Col N="17" /> regard to supervision and many other areas. There are many other fundamental issues to be addressed. These are non-pay issues but they are important to the profession. The Minister, Deputy Woods, said many times in the past year that the teaching forum would be an excellent exercise. That was not picked up until the Labour Court did so and recommended it. The Government has accepted that recommendation.</P>
    <P>It is pointless for me to say the same thing again because I have already answered Deputy Quinn's request. I know where I can and cannot be helpful and if I can be helpful in this matter, I will be.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Noonan that nobody is getting dug in. It is only ten days since the Labour Court finished a long and arduous examination of the case. That followed many other avenues. What the conciliation system did was rejected, as was arbitration. The facilitator did not get anywhere and what the Labour Relations Commission might have done did not get anywhere. It was moved into the Labour Court and that court did its best in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many Members have dealt with trade union officials, good, bad and indifferent, over the years. In a difficult situation it would have been normal practice to give a Labour Court decision more than a brief scan in an important case. One would seek clarification. I recall days when people sought clarification of things where nobody could work out what the clarification could be about. It was normal enough practice in industrial relations. That is not the case this time. This time there was no vote, no clarification, no nothing &ndash; just no.</P>
    <P>I am a little annoyed about the last point I wish to make but I will try not to be. A former president of ASTI and a respected member of the profession, who will be respected as far as I am concerned too, said this morning that ASTI is not interested in benchmarking or in the PPF. I cannot negotiate on those terms and I will not. If people wish to move to a position where all other sectors of the industrial relations world in this country are prepared to be, I will try to help. However, if somebody says it is all about 30%, breaking the PPF and making a nonsense of benchmarking, they are barking up the wrong tree and I will not, cannot and have no intention of negotiating with them. They had better make up their minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the same comments this morning. The Government has a responsibility to reinforce the teaching profession and our education system. That is what is at stake here. I can understand why the Government is so committed to maintaining PPF and my party supports the PPF, but ways round the present impasse can be found. A mechanism should be found whereby all members of the ASTI will have a voice in deciding the way forward as distinct from the comments of some high profile individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> The Taoiseach could clarify the benchmarking process, as from 4 December and as set out in his own union's magazine by the general secretary of the PSEU, Mr. Dan Murphy, for those ASTI members not fully aware of what it now is. There are gaps in information and perception, and anger, hurt and confusion have got in the way of clarity and an understanding of the present position. Only one person in this House has the power to break through the fog of obfuscation, mysticism and mystery which has begun to surround this dispute against the background of the rapidly approaching deadline of the examinations. That person is the Taoiseach. The Opposition has made constructive comments designed to find a solution for this democracy to give faith to the next generation of citizens possibly facing the biggest professional hurdle of their educational careers. On behalf of the students outside the gates of this House, will the Taoiseach take the initiative to call the parties together and elaborate what he knows to be fact but what protagonists in the dispute do not yet see as facts? </P>

Deputy Crawford's point is a valid one; it is vital that people adhere to the measures which have been intro<Col N="22" /> duced to prevent this disease. Unfortunately, the number of cases in the United Kingdom is now in excess of 400. The disease has spread all over the United Kingdom and we must continue to be very vigilant.

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12 to 20 seek to amend the Bill in such a way as to introduce a middle income tax rate of 30%. The Minister was good enough to acknowledge yesterday that I had tabled a number of parliamentary questions in advance of the budget, one of which sought to make comparisons between income tax rates here and in the United Kingdom. The Minister agreed yesterday that we still have a problem here in that those on middle incomes still pay more income tax than those on similar incomes in the United Kingdom. That is not the case at higher and lower rates of income tax.</P>
    <P>The problem could be addressed in three ways. The first would be to increase bands at the lower rate to take some 90% of taxpayers off the top rate and the second would be to significantly reduce the top rate. Both options would prove very expensive and be regressive in the latter case. We are proposing a third way which would be the most effective and equitable way of achieving our goal, namely, the introduction of a 30% rate. The 30% rate should apply in the case of a single person for an additional £11,100 after the standard rate and for an additional £22,200 in the case of a married couple. This would make eminent sense and prove far less costly than the other two options to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Our proposal would focus precisely on the group who still pay more income tax here than their counterparts in the United Kingdom. It would also focus on the earners we need to attract back to the country. There is a place for a third rate of income tax in order that those on middle incomes do not have to pay tax at the top rate of 42%, in addition to PRSI, relatively early, compared to other jurisdictions, in their income levels. I hope the Minister will accept the principle that there is a need for a third rate.</P>
    <P>There is a certain inevitability about the direction in which taxes are going. The Minister reduced the capital gains tax rate to 20% and the Bill introduces a share options scheme whereby gains will be taxed at 20%. Unearned income such as rental income is taxed at 25%, yet we have the completely anomalous situation whereby middle income earners pay tax at 42% on earned income, in addition to PRSI. That is an untenable position. Not only is it untenable, it is unwise. It is one of the factors inhibiting skilled workers either returning or coming to this country, and they are badly needed. There are many newly-married people working in London, New York and Boston, highly-skilled workers, who wish to come home. There are two important factors which inhibit their choice to come home, their take-home pay would be a great deal less and the high cost of housing. This amendment seeks to address the first of those problems. I <Col N="24" /> hope the Minister can at least accept the principle of the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments deal effectively with the higher rate, the issues of individualisation, the reduction of the higher rate and the proposal from Fine Gael to introduce a middle rate. We debated the issue of individualisation at some length last evening and I do not intend to repeat it. This debate concerns a minority of taxpayers and the measure is to the advantage of a very small minority of taxpayers. As the National Economic and Social Forum report shows, individualisation benefited mainly those in the top two deciles of income earnings. If it were to be pursued further, individualisation would be concentrated in the top decile, the top one-tenth of income earners. Frankly, this is not a relevant issue for the majority of taxpayers and perhaps the level of interest it has attracted is in a sense disproportionate.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to hear whether the Minister intends to pursue the individualisation project he launched with such fanfare last year. The pace of delivery has slowed dramatically. He announced his intention to implement this measure in three tranches, we presumed three equal tranches. If that were the case, he would have gone much further than he did this year. The indications from him on Committee Stage were that he sees it slowing down even further and perhaps not being completed at all. Perhaps the Minister could explain to the House how he intends to progress this project.</P>
      <P>I have said all I wish to say about the middle rate of taxation. I note that Fine Gael policy on this matter has changed in the past few weeks. The previous policy of introducing a rate of 35% would have applied to all income up to £50,000 for a single person and £100,00 for a married couple. It would have caused a dramatic reduction in the higher rate. The refinement clearly makes a significant difference. It applies over a narrower tranche of income and it is at a lower rate. I suppose it is fairer to call it a middle rate because that is what it has become. It is not a priority for me or for my party. My personal view is that there should be an introductory rate of income tax introduced as a new third rate rather than a middle rate. However, if resources allow, I would not object to the notion of a middle rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Minister became Minister for Finance, there has been an argument every year about the reduction in the higher rate of taxation and I do not think we are getting any nearer to consensus. It has always been my view that the reduction in the higher rate benefits only those who earn a substantial tranche of income which is subject to the higher rate. The Minister constantly and understandably from his own point of view deals with people who are just into the higher rate in terms of their marginal rate of tax. Those people do not benefit at all from reductions in the higher rate or else benefit very little. They benefit to the extent of £20 per £1,000 <Col N="25" /> earned. The only serious benefit is for people earning numbers of thousands of pounds where tax is payable at the higher rate. Reductions in the higher rate are of significant benefit only to people on high pay. It was at best a mistake for the Minister to identify that as a priority for his tax policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell makes the point about our tax rates being a significant feature in terms of encouraging Irish people to return to Ireland. That may have been the case in the recent past but I do not think it is the case any longer. The primary disincentive is that housing is not affordable. I do not believe our rates of taxation are the primary determinant any longer when people are making a decision to come to work here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. It is very important to consider the level of taxation and the rate of tax paid by middle income earners. If a single person earns more than £20,000 per annum, the 42% rate automatically applies. The major criticism from taxpayers is that the top rate of tax is reached very quickly. People in very modest jobs can now earn £20,000 quickly. Single people are caught in the trap whereby every little amount of overtime is liable for tax at 42% and PRSI at a further 4%. They are then taking home only 50% of their overtime earnings. This is a huge disincentive.</P>
      <P>Our economy is doing well and many factories, particularly in the export area, have mandatory overtime. These workers are then tipped into the 42% bracket very quickly and this is resented by them. A middle rate would be far more appropriate whereby a rate of 30% tax would come first and then the 42% rate for top taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The points made by Deputy Mitchell about returning emigrants are very important. Deputy McDowell said a major disincentive was the high cost of housing and the scarcity of housing near centres of employment. It was suggested to me recently that we are going to need 200,000 additional workers over the next four or five years. There are hundreds of thousands of Irish people abroad and many would love to return. In 1987, 45,000 young people left this country. We should now encourage those people to return. They would bring back skills acquired abroad and perhaps even some capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing and transportation costs are very high compared to other countries. A man with four adult children, three of whom work abroad and one at home, suggested that for every four years spent abroad, a returning worker should be given one year tax free. This would give them the opportunity to set up home and become re-established in Ireland. Perhaps the Minister could consider this suggestion. There may be difficulties with this suggestion because of EU regulations, but it should be considered. We need to make Ireland a more attractive place in which to work. At present there are problems with the higher rate of tax kicking in too quickly and the high cost of <Col N="26" /> housing. Perhaps the Minister will take on board the concept of a middle rate of tax. If he will not do it in this budget, perhaps he will do so in the next one which he continually informs us he will introduce. Perhaps he will also explore for the long term the possibility of attracting some emigrants by means of tax incentives. Such incentives are given for many reasons, such as repairing old houses. The most valuable asset a country can have is its workforce. Why not give emigrants an incentive to return home and join it by taking up employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments concern the income tax rates and bands structure to apply for the years 2001, 2002 and subsequent years of assessment. The amendments proposed by Deputies Jim Mitchell and McGrath envisage a structure containing a standard rate band of £14,800 for single persons, £17,131 for widowed parents and £29,600 for all married couples; introduce a new third  &ndash; intermediate &ndash; rate of 30% which would apply to a tranche of taxable income above the standard rate band of £11,100 for single persons, £8,769 for widowed parents and £22,200 for married couples; and retain the standard and higher rates as proposed in the Bill, with the higher rate applying to taxable income of £25,900 in the case of single taxpayers and widowed parents and £51,800 in the case of married couples.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment would, as he explained on Committee Stage, increase the standard rate band for married couples with one income from 36,823 to 38,000 in the year 2002.</P>
      <P>The overall effect of these amendments would be to set aside the move to widening the standard rate band which I took last year and which I have continued this year. As I explained previously, one of the main difficulties with the current band structure, which the amendments seek to retain, is that the single person's standard rate band is doubled for all married couples, whether one or two incomes are involved.</P>
      <P>When we discussed identical amendments on Committee Stage, I reminded the Select Committee that the Government is committed in its Action Programme for the Millennium to work towards having 80% of income earners taxed at the standard rate. The Government believes that the introduction of a single standard rate band for each individual taxpayer is essential to meet that commitment. The band-widening provided for in the Bill will mean that the percentage of income earners on the higher rate will fall to 23%, so that we are well on the way to achieving the programme target. With allowances converted into tax credits, the only way to reduce the numbers on the top tax rate is to widen the standard rate band. The most effective way to do that is to place it on an individual basis and tax people on what they earn as individuals, whether single or married. The first step in this direction was taken last year and we are continuing on this road in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> For tax reform to be meaningful, it must go beyond tinkering with the system. It must involve making radical change and that is what I have been engaged in since 1997. To put the income tax system on a sound foundation, I will not take on board any changes at this stage, apart from those signalled in the last general election campaign. My aim, at the end of the five budgets, is to have an income taxation system which, I hope, will be fair and equitable as well as being based on principles which are easy to understand. When such a system is in place, it should be relatively easy to make adjustments to it and to target changes towards specific groups. Ultimately, the approach to tax reform comes down to one's judgment and I will be happy to be judged on the combined effects of the five budgets which I will have brought forward by the time of the next general election. I believe in giving the electorate what it voted for at the last general election. Each of my budgets must be taken as part of a sequence. The tax strategy I have pursued has borne fruit in terms of higher take home pay and an increased incentive to work. I am confident the considered judgment of the electorate on this record will be favourable at the next general election.</P>
    <P>I made radical reforms to the entire tax system in the four budgets for which I have been responsible since 1997. It is now inherently fairer as a result of the introduction of tax credits. Tax rates have been cut to improve the incentive to work and to contribute to the development of the economy. Substantial numbers of taxpayers have been taken off the top rate of tax. In its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government highlighted the need to reduce the burden of personal taxation and to reward effort. Its answer to those needs has been to retain the two rate income tax system coupled with substantially reduced rates over the life of the Government. This is the programme in which we are engaged and whose targets are being achieved.</P>
    <P>As regards the introduction of a third intermediate rate of income tax, I am on record as having said that I would have no objection to it in principle. However, I will be prepared to consider a third rate only when the radical overhaul of the tax code to which I referred is complete. The introduction at this stage of a 30% rate will mean an effective cut of 12 percentage points for higher rate taxpayers at a time when the Government is trying to assist lower income taxpayers by endeavouring to remove as many of them as possible from the tax net. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell and McGrath raised the issue of the effect the marginal tax rate has on the capacity of the State to attract home individuals to work or to attract people from outside the country to work here. I readily accept some of what Deputy McDowell said in this regard, that other considerations are probably borne in mind by such individuals and that tax may not be the <Col N="28" /> only consideration. That said, the marginal tax rate has an effect on whether people are attracted to work in Ireland. They examine what their marginal tax rate will be. I refer to the marginal tax rate as the top rate of tax plus the employee PRSI contribution. Many people only take the marginal take-out into account. When we complete our programme in the next budget, the marginal take-out from a person's pay will be much less than when I took office. It has an effect on the attraction of Ireland as a location for people to return home to or to come here for the first time. I readily accept that there are other considerations, such as housing. People also like to have the choice. Many people who emigrated in the 1980s to America, for example, have decided that that is where they will stay for the rest of their days. That said, there are many who would like to return home and take up gainful employment and tax is definitely an issue with them, although it is less of a deciding factor than it was some years ago.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying I have no objection in principle to an intermediate rate of tax. When Deputy Noonan was the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, he started off with a 35% intermediate rate and, each time I adjusted the top rate, he adjusted his rate to half way between the standard and top rates of tax. Deputy Mitchell must assume that I will reduce the top rate of tax from 42% to 40% next year because he has gone all the way and changed the intermediate rate to 30%. We will have to wait and see what will be in the next budget, but he is thinking ahead, has decided that is what I will do and has set the rate at 30% instead of half way between 20% and 42%, which is 31%. However, we will have to wait for the next budget.</P>
    <P>As I have no objection in principle to the intermediate rate of tax, the logical question is why I have not introduced it before now. I have tried to explain this before. Economic circumstances definitely held back many Ministers for Finance from making radical changes to the taxation system and I accept that. However, even when they were in a position to make radical changes, such as moving to tax credits, having a single standard rate band or many other innovations, the difficulties were as follows. All commentators, pressure groups and lobbyists had become content with the system in place and, when the time for a budget approached, people wanted minor changes and some tinkering with the system. Successive Ministers for Finance made minor changes here and there with the result that we have the same old creaky system which has been in place since Adam was a small boy except for the fact that it has been tinkered with by politicians who made it much worse than it was ever intended to be. We have ended up with a crazy and ridiculous income tax system which has been developed over many years.</P>
    <P>Every time there is a problem an adjustment is made. Politicians make finance policy decisions with the help of their advisers and the unfortu<Col N="29" /> nate Revenue Commissioners then have to draft a particular section to pander to the stupidity of the politicians. The process gets so complicated that further adjustments are needed in following budgets and Finance Bills. This method has left us with a nonsensical system in many respects.</P>
    <P>What I have tried to do is to act as if I was creating a tax system from scratch. I hope after the next budget to have a sound taxation system grounded on easy to understand principles. The temptation will always be there for politicians to make a mess of things. However, it will take them time to mess up the system after these changes as it will be a transparent system grounded on solid foundations. To get to that point will involve controversy, but that is something I have never had a difficulty with during my political life, and not only as a Minister in various Governments.</P>
    <P>I have not tinkered with the idea of a new rate, as Deputy McGrath suggested, because if I did so it would dissipate resources. I would not be able to do what I want with the system. If I get to a satisfactory position it will be easy to introduce a new intermediate rate or to do what Deputy McDowell has suggested, and that is to introduce another rate altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not have principled objections to either idea but I refuse to let either idea enter my brain at present. If I did so I might fall prey to mistakes similar to those that have hampered previous Administrations. I want to elude the effects of those mistakes. There is a finite amount of money available and many things must be balanced in the budget. If I change intermediate or other rates I will not be able to achieve what I want. However, I do not have a principled objection to these rates. Perhaps these are matters that will be dealt with by the next Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been enough trouble with the European Commission without introducing such a tax holiday scheme. We would not create trouble between Ireland and Europe if we gave such a tax break to all taxpayers. However, to target such a relief at one section of workers would be seen by the Commission as distorting competition and as an unfair State aid.</P>
      <P>There have been many debates in the House about tax rate bands and allowances. I have succeeded in giving the most favourable tax regime to low paid employees in Ireland compared to tax regimes in the EU and further afield. Before the last budget, I used the opportunity of a question from Deputy Jim Mitchell &ndash; who was not a Finance spokesperson at the time &ndash; to make a comment on this matter. I mentioned the EU position at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to correct Deputy Mitchell on a point which he has misunderstood. He has said correctly that capital gains tax has reduced to 20%, capital acquisitions tax has effectively reduced to <Col N="30" /> 20% also, and many other changes have been made. However, the Deputy complains that rental income is taxed at 25%. This is a confusion. Rental income is to be aggregated as part of an individual's total income. It will be taxed at an individual's marginal tax rate if total income is sufficient. There is a 25% tax rate on one aspect of rental income but this only applies to the non-trading income of companies. Trading income for companies is taxed at the single low corporation tax rate at 12.5%. Only non-trading or passive income, including rental income, attracts the higher rate of 25%, but this provision only applies to companies.</P>
    <P>The debate on rates, bands and allowances will surely continue. The Government clearly outlined its policies in this area before the last election. The only surprise for some commentators is that we are doing what we said we would. When we get to the end-game in the next budget, most fair minded commentators will agree that the changes introduced make the system fundamentally fairer, more equitable, more transparent, easier to operate and easier to understand.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell will have to wait until the next budget to find out what action I intend to take on the widening of the standard rate bands. We have had this debate&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised many hares in his long reply and I will not chase any of them except to say that his claim to have made the system fairer is a lot of palaver. He has not made the system fairer. Instead, the tax changes have disproportionately favoured the wealthy. Those earning £100,000 plus, and those who benefit from capital gains and capital acquisitions taxes, are the real winners from the changes of recent years.</P>
      <P>Many of those changes were justified as tax rates were penal and there were huge disincentives to economic activity, but the Minister cannot claim that the system is fair when those on minimum income are still paying tax. How can he claim the system is fair when those on modest incomes are paying at the higher rate of tax? To have those on middle incomes with high mortgage payments, whose disposable and discretionary income is very low, paying tax at an effective rate of 50% is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has presided over this system for four budgets. The claim that the system is now fairer is incorrect and that is the major difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition. We want a fairer system and that does not mean penalising initiative or success. I <Col N="31" /> agree that these must be rewarded and that initiative bring dividends for the overall good of society.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot allow a situation where those on minimum income are paying tax, and where those on small disposable incomes are paying at the higher rate of tax or the same rate as those earning £250,000 or more. That is manifestly wrong. It is also counter-productive. The middle band, which is the subject of these amendments, is intended to alleviate the position of those on middle incomes who pay at the higher rate, without extending the concession to the very wealthy.</P>
    <P>The proposed Government policy is costly and unfair. Why should those with enormous incomes benefit to the same extent as those on middle incomes? This is one matter the Minister has failed to grasp. I know that in principle the Minister accepts such action may be possible in the future but we have an urgent problem now. We need to attract more people into our society in these areas of income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is at risk of beginning to believe some of his own propaganda, but I agree with him on one point. I did not think the higher rate of tax would be reduced to 42% or even 40%. I assumed that was there to keep the Progressive Democrats happy and I thought that when the ordinary, decent Fianna Fáil Party backbenchers realised the consequences of doing something so blatantly unfair, they would say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Sadly, we had not reckoned on the Minister really being a Progressive Democrats Deputy at heart. We should have guessed that at an early stage and I blame myself for not noticing it.</P>

      <P>I did not think the Minister would do it, so I accept I got that much wrong. However, the Minister should not start believing that he has a mandate for some of the other measures he introduced. He did not have a mandate for individualisation and he would not have received the support of his party for individualisation of the standard rate band if he had sought <Col N="32" /> it. In addition, he would not have received the support of the average Fianna Fáil Party supporter for such a measure if he had sought it.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not have a mandate for the reduction in capital gains tax and he did not seek a mandate for reducing tax on gains from 40% to 20%. He did not seek a mandate to reduce capital gains tax rate on development land to 20% and he would not have received such a mandate if he had sought it. The Minister's claim that he had a mandate for the various changes he made is not true. I accept there was a mandate to reduce the rates and that was done. Undoubtedly, the issue will be debated at length during the next general election campaign. There is little to be gained from prolonging this debate. As Deputy Mitchell said, there are fundamental differences between the approach on this side of the House and that taken by the Government. I do not accept there is a fairer system than if other measures had been taken.</P>

My commitment was to have 80% of workers paying tax at the standard rate. This commitment was contained in the Fianna Fáil Party's manifesto that was produced long before the last general election.

After the next budget, the commitment is that all those on the minimum wage will not pay tax. Deputy McDowell and others were surprised that we fulfilled our election promises, but everybody on the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net and less than 20% of workers will pay tax at the higher rate, which will be 42% and possibly 40% with <Col N="33" /> the standard rate at 20%.

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) for the purposes of this section a married couple, both of whom have attained 65 years of age, shall be treated in like manner as a married couple where both spouses are in employment irrespective of whether one or both spouses are in fact in employment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The relatively simple net point behind this amendment was brought to my attention by a colleague. The primary argument put forward by the Minister for individualisation of the standard rate band was to improve or increase the incentive to work. The amendment seeks to disapply individualisation to people over the age of 65 years, who typically are not in the work force. I accept this change would affect a relatively small number of people who are over the age of 65 and have an income of an amount that would benefit. However, as the primary rationale behind individualisation does not apply to such people, it is fair to remove them from the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There has been some progress in relation to the taxation of elderly people and this process should be continued. Deputy McDowell's point that they should receive double allowances is worthwhile. While the Deputy's amendment applies to the age exemption limit, I wish to mention the small income exemption of £8,200 for a couple. This amount has not changed for many years and I do not understand why the Minister has not altered it.</P>
      <P>It would be another way of taking people on relatively low incomes out of the tax net, particularly if they have families. For example, a couple with a family of four children can earn in excess of £200 without paying tax. However, if the small income exemption had been increased in recent years, it would have taken a large tranche of additional people out of the tax net. This would have been worthwhile. Perhaps the Minister could indicate why he decided not to change the small income exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the amendment, which is intended to benefit married couples where both spouses are aged 65 years or over, is <Col N="34" /> to exempt such persons from the band widening process so that they will retain full transferability of the standard rate band. It seeks to confer the benefit of the extended standard rate tax band which applies in the case of two income married couples in cases where only one spouse is in employment or has an income.</P>
      <P>As I explained in response to an identical amendment on Committee Stage, the standard rate tax band in the case of one income couples will be £29,000 in the full tax year. In the case of two income married couples, the band may be extended by up to £11,000 to £40,000. However, if the income of the second spouse was less than £11,000, such as £7,000, the standard rate band would be extended to £36,000. There is, therefore, no set band for two income couples. It depends on the income of the individual spouses and can vary from case to case, depending on the respective incomes.</P>
      <P>If only one spouse is in employment, the maximum standard band that can apply is £29,000. To attempt to extend this to equate with the position that might obtain if both spouses were in employment is not realistic in that there is no fixed measure of the amount by which it should be extended. To try to operate the amendment could lead to inequitable results. For example, a one income couple with an income of £36,000 would, under the amendment, enjoy a standard rate band covering the entire amount. A two income couple with the same total income comprising £32,000 plus £4,000 would benefit from a standard rate to a maximum of £33,000 &ndash; £29,000 plus £4,000 &ndash; with a top rate of tax applying to the balance of £3,000. It is obvious the amendment does not sit comfortably with the scheme of widening the standard band in the case of two income couples which I introduced last year and which I am continuing this year.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy is anxious to direct an easing of the tax burden towards the over 65s. My preference, if further assistance was to be given to that segment of the taxpaying population, would be to do so <i>via</i> the age exemption and the age tax credit avenues rather than by way of altering the rates structure. However, I have gone as far as can be reasonably expected in easing the tax burden this year and in the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell said that the main purpose in widening the standard rate band was to provide an incentive to work and that in view of this it should not apply here. While that is one of the effects of widening the band, the main reason is to provide for greater equity. Widening the standard rate band and having a single standard rate band for everybody is inherently more fair. It pertained until 1980-81, even at a time when Deputy McGrath and others believe people were far more conservative in their attitudes. None of those who complained last year said anything against what happened in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, introduced a change. As he explained on numer<Col N="35" /> ous occasions at the time, his move was not in response to the Murphy case in the High Court. The cost of implementing the finding in the Murphy case would have amounted to approximately £30 million, whereas doubling the bands cost approximately £130 million. Those figures are subject to correction, but I frequently referred to them last year. The effect of the change was to make the system very unfair, especially to single taxpayers and couples where both people work. My move to widen the standard rate band and have a single standard rate band for everybody is more equitable.</P>
    <P>I have done more to raise, by multiples, the exemption limits for the aged than any previous Minister. I have increased them further this year with the result that only a very small number over the age of 65 years are in the tax net. I intend to proceed in this manner.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy McGrath suggested amending the small income exemption limit. The effect of an exemption limit for all taxpayers was to create a poverty trap for many. For example, in 1997-98, the last tax year under the previous Administration, 108,145 taxpayers paid tax at the marginal rate. The effect of the exemption limit was to impose tax at the marginal rate for income above the limit. Most experts, sociologists and commentators advised that this created a major disincentive to those returning to the workforce. By increasing the personal allowances I have reduced the number who fall into this trap. After the budget there will only be 4,522 cases at the marginal rate, of which the probable majority will be over the age of 65 years. All the sociologists and those who do not subscribe to my views on economics or tax policy applaud these measures. They do not often trumpet my achievements in this regard on the radio, but have acknowledged them in private.</P>
    <P>By increasing personal allowances I have eliminated what was a real problem in the tax system. In this regard Deputy McDowell would not agree with Deputy McGrath. The system as it applied imposed tax at the marginal rate for those with incomes above the exemption limits. This acted as a disincentive to those returning to work. In 1997-98, 7.24% of all tax cases would have been in the marginal band. This has been reduced to 4,522 cases or 0.26%, a significant change.</P>

      <P>The Minister ignores the fact that at that stage the small income exemption limit was much bigger than the personal rate for a couple, but because he has increased the personal allowances for a couple where both paid tax at the marginal rate he has reduced the number paying tax at the marginal rate.</P>

      <P>The marginal band was introduced in the 1980s, but it was criticised for creating a real trap for those with children. Subsequent Ministers for Finance introduced an add-on for children where a person's income just exceeded the band and became eligible for tax. The system then became so crazy that further changes were needed. This has bedevilled the tax and PAYE system. I am trying to simplify it to the extent that anybody can understand it. I also hope to eliminate any remaining disincentives by the enactment of next year's Finance Bill. That is the reason I have not increased the small income exemption limit, but I have overcome the problem of the poverty trap by increasing personal allowances. This has been welcomed by some of my most strident political opponents, both inside and outside the House.</P>

      <P>In page 21, line 1, to delete &ldquo;21,586&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;25,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with the age exemption limits. Amendment No. 23 proposes to increase the limit for a married couple to 25,000 while amendment No. 24 proposes to increase it for single persons to 12,500. On this issue I agree with much of what the Minister said. The small income exemption limit was a very blunt way of dealing with a difficulty and perhaps created more problems than it solved. This is also true of several kinks that remain in the system. Another example is the levy in terms of the PRSI exemption limit. In both cases the levy is applied to all income above the limits provided. That creates a serious disincentive. When resources are available the matter should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I also agree on the general principle of seeking to exempt a significant part of the income of older people from tax. I am sure the Fine Gael Party also agrees with this. In previous Finance Bills I sought to have pension income as opposed to other income excluded from tax. The Revenue Commissioners have indicated it would be difficult to differentiate pension income from other income. I accept that in view of changes introduced in recent Finance Bills this issue is no longer as relevant as it was and that <Col N="37" /> we can now deal with all income that accrues to pensioners.</P>
    <P>There is some distance to travel. The social welfare pension has increased to approximately £107 per week, which, in terms of annual income, amounts to approximately £5,500. As we are aware from our constituency work, it causes enormous resentment when people pay tax on relatively small private pensions in addition to the social welfare pension, especially when they rightly take the view that they contributed to their social welfare pension. Every effort should be made to ensure those who are caught for what is in many cases a small amount of tax are removed from the tax net. That is the purpose of these amendments in seeking to increase the age exemption limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes an increase in the age exemption limits for persons aged 65 years or over by £1,000, from £7,500 to £8,500, for single taxpayers and by £2,000, from £15,000 to £17,000, for a married couple. Deputy McDowell's amendments propose an additional increase of approximately £1,300 for a single person and £2,600 for a married couple. The cost of the amendments is estimated to be £5.3 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The increase in the age exemption limits already provided in the Bill represent a substantial increase on the current exemption limits. Since I took office, I have increased the exemption limits for the aged by up to 85%. The increase in this year's Bill is in keeping with the Government's commitment to reduce taxation on the elderly and to remove as many elderly people as possible from the tax net. I am satisfied the increase proposed in the Bill is in keeping with the Government commitment to the elderly and is a fair and just increase. In the circumstances, I must reject the amendments. We touched on this in the last amendment when I said there were just 4,522 people on the marginal band rate. All these people are aged 65 or over.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath raised the question of age and the single income. One would need to be under 65 years of age and have six or seven children to increase the figure to the £13,000 exemption limit, that is, the personal married allowance of £11,000, plus £2,000 PAYE allowance.</P>

      <P>Increasing the personal allowance is a more effective way of dealing with the issue. It is my intention to rationalise the PRSI levy system in the next budget. I promised this two budgets ago. I made a substantial change in this year's budget by abolishing the PRSI limit for employers' contributions, to which Deputy McGrath was opposed. I abolished the lower threshold for proprietary directors and self-employed but I adjusted the PRSI rate for them. People on high incomes will not benefit from the <Col N="38" /> budget, something they will find out very soon. During my pre-budget analysis, I discovered there are substantial numbers of very high taxpayers in the country, including the self-employed, proprietary directors and so on who earn substantial incomes. There is a big gain from these people which will be compensated for by reducing the rate on others.</P>
      <P>I accept there are anomalies in the PRSI levy system. It is my intention to rationalise further this aspect. Some of the changes in recent years have made the situation even worse. There are anomalies, including steps, ceilings, thresholds, cut-in points, cut-out points, no income limits for health levies, PRSI starts, stops and kick-ins. I hope to complete the process in next year's budget. I do not expect everyone to accept what I have said in this regard or to applaud me on the taxation system, but I believe the system will be easier to understand and more effective. It would be pointless having a good income tax system if the PRSI levy system was so complicated that no one could understand it bar the specialists. I intend to rationalise that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 22, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;Section 123 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, (which relates to the general tax treatment of payments on retirement or removal from office or employment), is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (6):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(7) This section shall not apply, and it and section 114 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall be deemed never to have applied, to any payment made or to be made under the Irish Shipping Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Act, 1994.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We touched on this issue during Committee Stage when I did not get an opportunity to move the amendment. This deals with the position of the former employees of Irish Shipping which was wound up, to all intents and purposes, by the Government in the 1980s. The Minister's response on Committee Stage suggested that the Revenue effectively treated the payments eventually made to Irish Shipping employees as redun<Col N="39" /> dancy payments in the same way as any other redundancy payment. That is to ignore the reality of what happened. What happened is that for a period of almost ten years after the forced winding up of the company, a number of former employees of Irish Shipping initiated a case against the Minister seeking compensation for damages. Some ten years after the winding up of the company, agreement was eventually reached and payment was made on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis to all the former employees of the company. It was not anticipated by those who made the arrangement at the time that they would be regarded as redundancy payments. All the circumstances suggest they are not ordinary redundancy payments. This is an anomaly going back to times past, but it is one which seriously affects a relatively small number of people. The Minister will be aware from representations that these people are still seeking redress. These people make a fair case, that is, that effectively the <i>ex gratia</i> payments to them by way of compensation should be regarded as tax free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised this amendment on Committee Stage two weeks ago. There is little more I can say on this matter beyond my response on that occasion.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to specifically exempt in full from tax compensation payments made to former employees of Irish Shipping Limited. Under normal rules, these payments are chargeable to tax subject to the exemptions due in respect of redundancy payments. From 1993 the exemption was £6,000 plus £500 for each year of service. In 1999 the exemption was increased to £8,000 plus £600 for each year of service. This is a generous exemption.</P>
      <P>While I have sympathy for those affected when Irish Shipping collapsed, I also have sympathy for any employee who loses a job and it would be inappropriate for me to make an exception in this case without applying it across the board to redundancy payments in all cases, and this is something I am not prepared to do. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>In the recent past, I met a representative of the former employees of Irish Shipping. This man, who has pursued this issue for a number of years, made a good case to me. I do not want to create a precedent in this regard because several changes would then have to be made. I will seek to revisit the matter between now and next year's Finance Bill to see if I can come up with some alleviation measure. I take on board what the Deputy said. These people fought long and hard before the State relented and gave an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in 1993. I do not want to make a specific commitment except to say I have not closed my mind to the issue.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I welcome the indication by the Minister that he may consider the issue again. I should declare a <Col N="40" /> special interest in the matter because, as the then Minister for Transport, I had the unpleasant duty of seeking the liquidation of Irish Shipping because of the unfortunate circumstances that arose at the time. The legal reality had to be faced that nothing could be done for several years afterwards until the statute of limitations had run out, otherwise the State would have been exposed to huge demands arising from unauthorised actions by certain individuals. Those unauthorised actions are the consequence of Irish Shipping having to be liquidated with very adverse consequences for the employees of the company who were a credit to this country. It would be an act of reparation if the Minister could see his way to meeting the overall intent of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said. However, these people have been getting sympathy from the political establishment for a long time, much like the employees of the Hospital Sweepstakes. We eventually made a reasonable arrangement with the former Hospital Sweepstakes workers which received general acclaim and consensus approval in the House. It would be possible without much difficulty &ndash; to use that appalling phrase &ndash; to ringfence this particular payment to ensure we would not be setting a precedent. That would not be the case as the circumstances surrounding the winding up of Irish Shipping and the case taken and subsequently settled are distinct.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments seek to increase rent allowance for various categories to 6,350 for married couples under the age of 55 years, to 8,000 for married couples over the age of 55 years, to 3,175 for single persons under the age of 55 years and to 4,000 for single persons over the age of 55 years. I still do not understand the reason, when the allowance was introduced, such a major distinction was made between those under and above the age of 55 years. If the Minister has any insights, I would be interested in hearing them as I am not totally persuaded that the circumstances justify such a major discrimination against those under the age of 55 years. That, however, is not the specific point of the amendments, the purpose of which is to increase the allowance to ensure it is more or less at the level of benefit obtained by a person on the full <Col N="41" /> rate of mortgage interest relief. They are intended to be tenure neutral.</P>
    <P>The report on the private rented sector recommends that we take action of this kind. There is a long tradition of people wanting to own their own homes, but a considerable number choose not to and are obliged by circumstances &ndash; not least the price of houses &ndash; to rent. It is only equitable in the circumstances that those who rent, particularly those who rent long-term, receive the same measure of assistance and encouragement from the Exchequer as those who buy their own homes. That is the purpose of the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Those living in private rented accommodation have received a raw deal under the tax code from this and previous Governments. In his Budget Statement the Minister announced an increase, from £750 to £1,000, in relief for single persons, in effect an increase of 70p per week. That was the improvement for which he provided for those living in private rented accommodation. The bonus, payback or tax break those living in private rented accommodation currently receive is £1,000 or £200 at the rate of 20%, a miserly £4 per week, to meet the large amount they must pay to rent an apartment or house. The weekly rates for rented accommodation are £70, £80, £100 and £120. Many have no choice, but to rent. I cannot understand the reason the Minister is not giving a more substantial tax break to those in private rented accommodation. Given the tax that could be clawed back from many of those who own private rented accommodation, it would surely be much more beneficial for the Minister to provide for a decent clawback to tenants to ensure they would be tempted to claim it and thereby indicate those who own the properties they rent. This would enable the Minister to note the names of all those who own rented accommodation and collect tax from them.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the reason the cut-off point of 55 years of age applies to the relief. Will the Minister explain the reasons for this?</P>
      <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister said that the full year cost of such a measure would be £7 million. That was a gross exaggeration. The cost of the tax break he has given is only in excess of £3 million in a full year. I obtained this information from the reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me. I calculated the sums from the information given and spoke to an official in the Department who agreed that the figure of £7 million was very much over the top. Is there an explanation for this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments relate to the relief for rent paid by individuals in respect of private rented accommodation. The level of rent qualifying for relief is dependent on one's marital status and age, under or over 55 years of age. The amendments seek to increase the rent allowance available to taxpayers for the tax year 2002. <Col N="42" /> Deputy McDowell proposes to amend the allowance available to married and widowed persons from 2,540, or £2,000, to 6,350, or £5,000, for those under 55 years of age and from 5,080, or £4,000, to 8,000, or £6,300, for those aged 55 years and over. In addition, he is proposing an increase in rent relief for single persons from 1,270, or £1,000, to 3,175, or £2,500, for those aged under 55 years and from 2,540 or £2,000, to 4,000, or £3,150, for those aged 55 years or over. I estimate that the cost of these amendments would be £33.7 million approximately in a full year.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell also tabled amendments on rent relief on Committee Stage of last year's Finance Bill which he indicated were an attempt to align rent relief with mortgage interest relief. While I was not in a position to accept his amendments last year, I indicated that I would consider the matter again this year. In the Bill I am providing for an increase of one third in the relief available to under 55 year olds, on top of the 50% increase provided for last year. The relief for those aged 55 years and over remains the same as last year when it was doubled and is the same as that available generally for mortgage interest. The amendments would provide for the same level of rent relief for those under the age of 55 years as that available to first-time house purchasers and give greater relief to those aged 55 years and over. Obviously, this is not a proposition I could accept. No doubt I will consider the appropriate level of rent relief again prior to next year's budget. In the meantime, I am not prepared to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>Deputies asked the reason a cut-off point applies for those under and over the age of 55 years. While no one can remember the reason, we put it down to the usual excuse, the cost factor. The relief was introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Quinn. The ratio, in cost terms, as between those under the age of 55 years and those aged 55 years and over is in the order of approximately 20:1. One can understand the reason for this given the number of young people who rent accommodation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath raised a question on the basis of information he obtained in a reply to a parliamentary question. He received the historical figures. The budget costings were based on the numbers forecast for the 2001 tax year. The Deputy will be aware that the budget costings figure, say, at the 22% rate, is a good deal less generous than when the rate is reduced. That is another reason for a change in the figures. As tax rates are reduced, the tax system becomes much fairer and more are removed from the tax net or pay tax at the standard rate &ndash; the intention is that 668,000 will be removed from the tax net this year and <Col N="43" /> that only 23% will pay tax at the top rate after this year's budget &ndash; the question arises as to whether reliefs should be given in a variety of areas.</P>
    <P>A colleague of the Deputy proposed on Committee Stage that, as a result of the fall in tax rates that will apply to a particular relief, I should increase the tax break for that relief. I do not follow that logic, but people are inclined to pursue it. As people will have more money in their pockets due to lower taxation, the question will arise in time as to whether there should be a myriad of tax breaks in place. That is a legitimate topic for another day. As the standard tax rate has been reduced to 20% and the top rate to 42% &ndash; it will possibly fall to 40% after the next budget &ndash; Deputy Mitchell has proposed an intermediate rate of 30%. I do not have a principled objection to having intermediate rates after the process is completed. If tax rates are to be low, we can then raise the question of whether a whole myriad of tax breaks should be there at all. People will have more money to do what they want, so why give them a tax break unless one has policy reasons for so doing? Unfortunately, in this country &ndash; I am sure it is the same in other countries &ndash; when the basis for either a relief, a tax break or a grant has long gone and the reason for having it is no longer valid, we fail to take away either the relief or the grant because to do so would bring all kinds of political depredation down on top of the unfortunate Minister who would propose it. It is an unfortunate consequence of politics as much as anything else. As tax rates go down, the tax take reduces and as people have more money, undoubtedly a question for another day is whether many of the tax breaks should continue. I will not revisit that matter before the next election. I will do it as Minister for Finance after the next election.</P>

I get the impression from listening to him that he still thinks there is some basic justice in aligning the level of relief given to people who are tenants as opposed to people buying their own houses.

      <P>There is undoubtedly that angle to it. I am aware that a few years ago the Revenue Commissioners had a major campaign in Dublin to detect landlords who were not returning their taxes. Due to other issues they have had to examine in recent times, I do not know whether there has been a big push on that. Revenue made a big effort to register landlords in Dublin. Due to a number of changes which have been made in recent years, further landlords are registering. The level of tax evasion by landlords in 2001 is a great deal less than it was in 1990. Undoubtedly, the fact people can claim a tax break and must give the name of their landlord would have had an effect of regularising the tax position of a number of landlords in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be right that there is an improvement in tax observance by landlords, but it is not dramatic. It is still very evident in my constituency that there is widespread lack of observance of not only the tax laws, but of planning laws and housing and fire regulations. I am absolutely appalled by the lack of will in the authorities, central Departments as well as local authorities, to address this issue in a serious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a suggestion a couple of years ago which I will again make to the Minister. If we really want to tackle tax evasion among property owners, one way of doing it would be to require by statute the ESB to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners every dwelling that has more than one meter and to disclose the names of those renting those meters. That would be a simple way of knowing the dwellings in multi-occupation. It would not identify houses in single occupation but, at least, it would address those housing in multi-occupation. It could also be used to the benefit of local authorities because if they knew <Col N="45" /> the houses in multi-occupation, they would know which had planning permission and which observe the fire and other housing regulations.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it could be used to highlight the abuse of the rent subsidy. That is something which has grown exponentially in recent decades and there is widespread abuse of that as well. Rent subsidy at the moment is in excess of £100 million. It went up from £3 million seven or eight years ago. I am not against rent subsidy and I am very much for it for those who are entitled to it. Each week at my clinics I hear of people who are getting rent subsidy on the basis that they are of a certain status when they manifestly are not &ndash; for example, when there is a couple living in a house rather than a single person or where someone is working. The idea of requiring the ESB to disclose to the relevant authorities, including the Revenue Commissioners, where there is more than one meter in a dwelling is something that would be of great advantage in the prevention of evasion by landlords. It would also help the Minister to come up with a more focused policy in giving tax relief mainly to those paying very high rents and who need a tax break.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine further the proposition made by Deputy Mitchell regarding electricity supply and how we could make some changes which would lead to greater regularisation of people's tax affairs by that method. I understand we would have to introduce a section to empower us to compel the ESB to give us that information, but it is something worth considering. In regard to the rent subsidy, when Deputy Mitchell was chairperson of the finance committee we spoke about it on many occasions. It has grown enormously. When I was Minister for Social Welfare it was growing and it has got bigger and better.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made fortunes for landlords all over the country and put people into hovels. It has been an absolute disgrace. As far as taxation is concerned, there is provision for the health boards to supply the Revenue Commissions with the names of the landlords to whom the rent subsidy is paid. There has been a problem in some health board areas in regard to computerisation and giving that information. At least the power is there in that area to allow the health boards to give the relevant information to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the innovations put forward by Deputy Mitchell are well worth considering. If landlords were forced to get their tax affairs in order, they would automatically get other aspects in order, such as complying with all the fire and planning regulations. We have learned to our cost that when we start to apply the law in one area, people give up in that area. When we enforced the law in regard to child care regulations, we removed 4,000 child care places overnight. That <Col N="46" /> was the downside of having very good regulations. It was very necessary to have the regulations but the downside was that we automatically removed 4,000 places out of what was scarce enough supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. When people are taken out of the system initially, special regulations are introduced. More people then enter the system and are properly regulated but it takes time. The same is happening to an extent in the housing sector but these other ideas can also be considered.</P>

      <P>This issue has been raised at the Committee of Public Accounts on several occasions. Health boards insist on ignoring the planning laws and fire regulations in granting rent subsidies. If we are looking towards a package in respect of this issue, the ESB and other authorities should be included and it could then be examined. It would be wise to avoid the problems which give rise to additional scarcity as people leave the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 41, to delete &ldquo;130&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;300&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We did not reach this amendment on Committee Stage because of the guillotines that had been agreed. It refers to the innovative allowance introduced by the Minister in the budget regarding trade union contributions. This issue has been part of the partnership discussions with the trade union movement for many years as the movement sought tax relief on the contributions of trade union members. The Minister accepted the principle in the budget but, having done so, he capped it at £100 per year, which means the financial benefit to any subscriber to a trade union is £20 per annum. This highlights all that is wrong with the relationship between Fianna Fáil and the trade union movement. It is very much a sop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the discussions about the principle. However, having accepted it, the principle could at least have been given some teeth so that it would be of benefit to those who subscribe to trade unions. There is no great rocket science behind the figure I picked, but the cap of £100 in terms of annual subscriptions is too low. I suggest <Col N="47" /> a figure of 300, which is approximately £250, and it is more realistic and appropriate in terms of the subscriptions paid by individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I thought it was a funny joke that trade union subscriptions of up to £100 would be allowable for tax relief but only as a tax credit of 20%, which works out at £20 per year. Most union subscriptions are more than £100 per annum. The Minister's proposal is small. He could easily increase the level of subscription allowable.</P>
      <P>There is also a clause in the provision of the tax allowance for trade union subscriptions whereby the information garnered by the Revenue Commissioners cannot be used for any other purpose. In other words, if one million people register as paying a trade union subscription the Minister cannot press a button on his computer to establish who they are and use the information for another purpose. I am informed by individuals in the tax business that it is most unusual for this clause to accompany such a measure. Why has it been provided? It is strange that this provision has been made. If I am a member of a trade union and, for example, I have two jobs but am registered for only one for tax purposes, the Revenue cannot approach me and say I am not paying tax on my second income. It is a strange measure from the point of view of tax consultants. Why has it been included in this provision? Has there been an agreement with the trade unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much support the amendment. We owe a great deal of debt to the trade union movement. It has been highly responsible and patriotic and not just over the past 15 years. That was equally true when I was the shadow Minister for Labour in the 1970s. The trade union movement has contributed enormously to Ireland's economic well-being. It has taken the overall interest of the country into account more than any other interest group, yet any support for the funding of trade unions by the State is minuscule. There is provision for funding to assist amalgamations and so on.</P>
      <P>Would it be more apt if trade union contributions were treated similar to charitable donations? The trade unions would, therefore, get the same benefit as charities when they receive donations as has been provided for elsewhere in the legislation. It would be well justified and warranted support of the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced in my budget speech last December my intention to introduce as a recognition of the role of trade unions an annual tax allowance at the standard rate of income tax for membership subscriptions to trade unions. The amount I propose is a flat £100 and the figure of 130 referred to in the section, which Deputy McDowell seeks to increase to 300, is the rounded up euro equivalent of £100. The new <Col N="48" /> allowance will be available regardless of the amount of the subscription. I am satisfied the £100 is a reasonable amount, being roughly equivalent to what most trade union members pay each year. Apprentices and trainees pay less. The trade union movement did not make any representations for an increased figure and seems to be generally pleased with the introduction of the relief. I am not prepared to accept the amendment in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised a number of questions. The subscriptions for SIPTU and Mandate, which provide the bulk of ICTU's membership, are less than £100 per year. There is a higher subscription for some white collar public service unions but these are in the minority. Deputy McGrath referred to a clause in the proposal. That is a standard clause for data protection purposes and trade union members sought it. It is also provided in the mortgage interest section for tax relief at source.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked why I do not treat subscriptions similar to charitable donations. The trade union movement does not regard itself as a charity. It was a significant step to grant this tax credit to trade union members. It is something they sought for many years. It was resisted by successive Ministers for Finance of different persuasions because it creates a new principle in the tax code. The general principle for employees is that they receive tax allowances only for the performance of their duties. Membership of a trade union does not relate to performance. That is one of the reasons successive Ministers would not provide such relief. Trade unions have sought it for a long time at the standard rate and they are happy with the cap of £100 at the standard rate.</P>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy McDowell meant when he referred to the unique relationship between Fianna Fáil and the trade unions. I am reminded of the two individuals in County Kildare who were responsible for getting me into politics. They visited my home one Sunday and told me they had made me secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann some three weeks previously, without having told me there was a meeting. Those were the days when one could say everyone in one house was Fianna Fáil while everyone in another was Fine Gael or Labour. That is changing gradually in my county.</P>
      <P>One of those men, Jim O'Grady, was a staunch trade unionist. He is now gone to his eternal reward but he prided himself on being a strong trade unionist and a die-hard supporter of Fianna Fáil. He influenced my thinking on trade union affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will go down that road.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister has accepted the principle that trade union contributions should be tax deductible. Having established the principle it would have been a significant and important step to say that whatever contribution is made should be deductible without a cap. I do not understand why he has not done that as it seems unlikely this allowance would be abused. It is extremely unlikely that people would inflate their trade union contributions for the purpose of claiming what is, after all, a pretty small tax credit. Having accepted the principle he should have brought this in without a cap.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 36, line 11, to delete &ldquo;7.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;7.(1)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 15 provides for a taxation system for share options granted to employees under schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners. Under an approved share option scheme, employees, instead of being charged for income tax on part of the gain to them from the shares of the date of the exercise of the option and the capital gains tax on any further gain on the subsequent disposal of the shares, will be charged only the capital gains tax on the full gain. That is the difference between the amount paid for the shares and the amount received on disposal of the shares. To qualify for this favourable treatment there will be a requirement that the period between the date of the grant of the option and the date of any subsequent sale of the shares must be at least three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for approval by the Revenue Commissioners the schemes must provide that all employees and full-time directors are eligible to <Col N="50" /> participate in the scheme on similar terms. Under the similar terms rule, the options may be granted by reference to remuneration, length of service or other similar factors. The option price must be stated at the time the option is granted and must not be less than the market value of the shares at that time. To assist companies in the retention of those employees who are vital to the company's success but who, because of their skills and experience are highly mobile, the scheme may, however, contain a key employee element, where options can be granted which do not meet the &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; conditions, provided that at least 70% of the total number of shares over which rights are granted under the scheme in any year are made available to all employees or directors on similar terms.</P>
    <P>When the section was discussed in Select Committee, I indicated I had received a number of representations about the scheme as published and that I would consider a number of amendments on Report Stage. The amendments I now propose are as follows. Amendments Nos. 32 and 33 are designed to allow former employees, who have been granted options by the company while in employment, to exercise those options after they have ceased employment with the company. Most companies allow former employees to exercise options within a stated period of leaving; the norm indicated by multinationals is in the region of 90 days while the Irish Association of Investment Managers guidelines suggest a period up to 12 months where the employee leaves at normal retirement age or dies and up to six months in other cases.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 is designed to allow part-time directors to participate, at the company's discretion, in an approved share option scheme. While most schemes do not admit part-time directors, some do. The amendment brings the new scheme into line with approved profit-sharing schemes where part-time directors may be admitted to such schemes at the discretion of the company. Amendment No. 34 is a technical amendment to copperfasten that at any time a company makes a grant of options, all eligible employees and directors must be entitled to receive grants at that time under the &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; rule.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 35 elaborates on what &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; means. Companies usually grant options once a year and in some instances new employees are entitled to the appropriate grant for the year in which they join, even if this is after the normal grant aid for that year. Also, in some schemes employees are not entitled to grants in the run-up to normal retirement. The IAIM guidelines, for example, suggest that options should not be granted in the two years prior to normal retirement. The amendment therefore provides that where new employees in their first year of employment receive options at a different time or on different terms from the generality of employees, or employees within a period of normal retirement fitted into the scheme are not <Col N="51" /> granted options, the &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; requirement will not be breached. The amendment also ensures that where, as provided for in amendment No. 32, a company allows part-time directors to participate in the scheme, they must also do so on similar terms.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 removes the condition that schemes must contain a rule that, if it subsequently transpires that options are not issued at least at market value on the day the option is granted, as required by the legislation, the price must be increased accordingly. Existing schemes may not have such an explicit rule and the condition is therefore being removed to avoid such schemes being without what basically would be a technicality. The condition will, however, remain an implicit requirement and failure to comply with it will result in withdrawal of approval.</P>
    <P>I commend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>While I support the idea that options may be exercised by those people who have retired at normal age or, in the case of a person who has died, his or her spouse or heir within a given period, is there a danger that this proposal will affect loyalty? I thought one of the ideas of a share option was to encourage loyalty and to encourage people to stay with a firm. Will the Minister clarify whether this will cut across that purpose?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following day long discussions with the pro-Agreement parties on Thursday, 8 March, the two Governments issued a statement in which we set out a framework for continuing work, which would help restore the momentum behind the <Col N="53" /> implementation of the Agreement. We urged all concerned to respond positively to that statement. I welcome the statement of Wednesday, 14 March, stating that the IRA had met the independent International Commission on Decommissioning and I look forward to further early positive developments in pursuit of the IRA commitment to resolving the arms issue as set out in its statement of 6 May 2000.</P>
    <P>In terms of the outstanding issues, the statement of the two Governments restated the commitment by the British Government of May 2000 to continue progressively to take all the necessary steps to secure as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland, consistent with the level of threat, on which it will consult with the Irish Government. The British Government would continue with a security normalisation process to include reductions in the level of troops and installations in Northern Ireland until normality is restored. The Governments also recognised that there is an issue to be addressed regarding supporters of organisations now on ceasefire against whom there are outstanding charges for offences committed before 10 April 1998. They stated that in the context of the agreement of May 2000 being implemented, they intend to take the necessary steps in their jurisdictions to resolve this difficulty, so that those concerned are no longer pursued.</P>
    <P>Regarding the operation of the institutions, the two Governments committed themselves to doing all within their power to sustain the full operation of the institutions, including during any formal review of the Agreement which may be necessary and called on all others to do likewise. They also stated that it continues to be essential that the full operation of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council resume, and that all the institutions continue their important work. Significant progress has also been made on policing, and discussions will continue over the coming period with a view to reaching an agreement in June.</P>
    <P>My programme of engagements for the St. Patrick's Day period began on Thursday, 15 March, when I attended a lunch on Capitol Hill hosted by Speaker Hastert. President Bush, Secretary of State Powell and National Security Adviser Rice and party leaders from Northern Ireland also attended, as did the Ceann Comhairle and a large number of members of Congress. In my remarks, I took the opportunity to express appreciation for the support of both Houses of Congress for the peace process. In the afternoon, I met Senators Ted Kennedy and Dodd and briefed them on the recent discussions between both Governments and the parties. That evening, I addressed the American Ireland Fund gala dinner which honoured Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Jim Walsh. I was delighted to have the opportunity there to acknowledge the important contribution of the fund and to add my tribute to Senator Dodd and Congressman Walsh <Col N="54" /> for their unstinting support for the peace process and for their overall commitment to Irish issues on Capitol Hill.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 16 March, I chaired a breakfast meeting of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board, where I briefed members on the peace process. The meeting also included a discussion on developments in both the Irish and US economies, and on our strategy for research, development and innovation. Later that morning, following the traditional presentation of shamrock at the White House, I had a very positive meeting with President Bush. I was very pleased that the President pledged his administration's strong support for our efforts to implement the Good Friday Agreement, and his willingness to help the two Governments in every appropriate way, and I welcome the nomination of Mr Richard Haas to take responsibility for Northern Ireland within the State Department. We also discussed the very positive economic relationship between our two countries, as well as a wide range of international issues. Following my meeting, I attended a reception in the White House, hosted by the President, with the leaders of all the main parties in Northern Ireland in attendance. I then returned home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Is it fair to say that in the joint statement between the two Governments that essentially no deal was reached but progress was made? Can the Taoiseach give any further detail as to how close we are to an agreement that could amount to a deal? Does he have any date for when General de Chastelaine's report will be produced or how imminent is it? Some reports said it was due this week. In his discussions with the British Prime Minister was the question of local and general elections in the UK raised given the sensitivities and fears in this country about the spread of foot and mouth disease and is the British Prime Minister cognisant of those fears when organising domestic matters in the UK?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks went better than I thought and the round table process worked. There were two fairly lengthy sessions, one at midday and one late in the evening. The rest of the day was taken up with bilateral and multilateral meetings. The atmosphere and the engage<Col N="55" /> ment of all parties were good. The small parties often feel they are not as close to matters as they would like and a day like that is useful for them. The Irish and British Governments like to give time to them when they seek meetings. We are looking at ways to bring the smaller parties up to date on matters. That was the first round table format meeting since May. I had several meetings and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have had meetings on different occasions.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive agreement was never going to be achieved but progress was made on policing. As outlined by the Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon, the SDLP is very close to a conclusion. Although such progress was not articulated by Sinn Féin, a significant number of the issues it raised have been comprehensively addressed. We have certainly come a long way, if not quite full circle, as a result of the various legislative and other moves up to the consent reached before Christmas. There are some outstanding issues which we will continue to discuss prior to June to see whether we can achieve resolution. Some of these issues relate to flags and emblems and how precisely those will be addressed. People are concerned that agreement may be reached but nothing will happen. Northern Nationalists and republicans have concerns about having a police force about which they are unclear.</P>
      <P>We have addressed the operational matters and the RUC Chief Constable, Mr. Ronnie Flanagan, has been helpful in this regard. While there are some outstanding issues in this area, most of them have been well teased out.</P>
      <P>On decommissioning, I do not know when a statement will be made but it was clear in the statement made last week that engagement had commenced and would continue with the objective of getting back to 5 May statement about finding ways to put arms beyond use in a manner acceptable to the public. I hope the process will be a short one and I do not expect any undue delays.</P>
      <P>The British Government does not intend to move on demilitarisation in any substantive way although it may address some issues in the short term. However, it will not move on any other issues until it sees what happens in regard to decommissioning. That is the straightforward position outlined by the British Government.</P>
      <P>Good progress was made on OTRs &ndash; on the runs &ndash; and we can resolve this issue over the coming months. Some of the other smaller, though not less important, issues raised were cleared and significant progress was made on others. Hopefully, further progress will be made between now and June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised foot and mouth disease on the periphery of my meeting with the British Prime Minister and outlined our concerns, as I had done pre<Col N="56" /> viously by telephone. However, I did not ask him, nor did he offer to tell me, when the next general election would be held in Britain. Of course, the date for the local elections has been fixed for 3 May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, OTRs aside, one of the issues which was not referred to in the statement of 8 March which constitutes an integral part of progress in regard to the achievement of lasting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland is the position of those people who have effectively been exiled from Northern Ireland by paramilitaries on both sides? Does the Taoiseach feel it would be useful for the two Governments to call on Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, on the one hand, and the various loyalist parties and associated paramilitaries, on the other, to indicate that, in response to full and comprehensive movement on the issue of OTRs, all of the summary diktats to people exiled from Northern Ireland for whatever reason, would be removed and that people would be free to return to their own communities without fear of being beaten up by people using baseball bats etc.?</P>
      <P>In regard to progress on policing, will the Taoiseach indicate whether he is satisfied that the review of the legislation which gave effect to the Patten proposals &ndash; a review which we would normally expect to be completed in the next 18 months &ndash; will take on board any operational or legal changes which may become necessary? Will any such changes, therefore, be built into a process which, of itself, will be self-correcting?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the British Government is in a position to make progress on or clarify the role of the RUC in three particular instances which gave rise to Nationalists' lack of confidence in the force, namely the deaths of Mr. Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and solicitor, Pat Finucane? Has any progress been made, since we last spoke about this issue in the House, on the British Government's attitude to particular forms of inquiry which would remove those three instances as an obstacle to full participation by both communities in Northern Ireland in a modern police force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the OTR issue were fully dealt with, all people who have been threatened, abused or forced out of Northern Ireland or who live in unsafe circumstances should be totally free of any threat, particularly people who left Northern Ireland a long time ago and have never been able to return to their families. We have stated that clearly and would restate it in any overall package. Like other Members, I have met many of the relatives of these people in recent years. This is a very serious matter. It is essential that arms are put beyond use in the attempt to achieve normality in Northern Ireland. I previously called on parties associated with paramilitary groups to clarify their position on these matters and they have all done so, although not all of the threaten<Col N="57" /> ing activities have ceased. However, the level of punishment beatings and other horrendous issues which, in the past, were raised in this House week in, week out has reduced dramatically. I hope that will continue to be the case as we move into the summer when the atmosphere is always more difficult and dangerous. I will continue to raise this issue in any future discussions.</P>
      <P>On the policing review, I do not believe all of the issues can be resolved without legislation. We must examine this issue in an overall context. It is unlikely that the British Government will introduce a Bill immediately in regard to this, certainly not before the general election. As Deputy Quinn suggested, that would be the right way to proceed. The highly respected oversight commissioner, Mr. Tom Considine, and others, will review precisely how the legislation and reforms are operating and how the police service in Northern Ireland develops and evolves. It has not been agreed, as yet, that a designated person or group will play a particular role in this area although a number of groups may feed into the process. I am confident, following the recent talks, that we can arrive at a process whereby most of these issues will be resolved although it may not be possible to resolve some of them in the absence of a legislative base. The introduction of a Bill in the coming year would certainly be helpful.</P>
      <P>We did not resolve the position on the inquiries into the deaths of Mr. Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane but there was considerable depth of feeling on the matter, especially on the part of the SDLP which has always kept these inquiries &ndash; that of Pat Finucane, in particular &ndash; to the forefront. I have stated on many occasions that the Finucane inquiry is different to the others for obvious reasons which I do not need to restate.</P>
      <P>The Finucane inquiry is viewed in a different light. I do not see how progress can be made until that case is resolved. The British Government has a resistance to setting up judicial reviews on these issues because it believes that other inquiries are ongoing which may throw some light on these issues. I do not wish to take away from the good work of those inquiries, but a decade has now passed. Proof is essential, however, and hearsay will not be sufficient and that has been a difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of State Dr. Reid is now aware of the depth of feeling and the Government, through the Minister Deputy Cowen, has made the British authorities aware that these issues must be dealt with. Some cases are easier than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finucane issue will not go away. I do not see the SDLP giving way, and I do not think it should give way on that issue. It believes there was widespread collusion and wrong-doing involved and it must be exposed. If the SDLP is to co-operate with the setting up of the Northern Ireland Police Service, it might be in a position in which it could not then go back over some of <Col N="58" /> these cases. There is a clear understanding now that these issues are not for negotiation, they are fundamental issues going to the core of what the RUC stood for, for good or ill, in the past. I do not wish in saying that, to take away the good name of many officers who have served well. I think some of those three cases might involve more than just the RUC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has frequently referred to four issues: decommissioning: demilitarisation, policing and persons on the run. I take it that for the first three the strategy now is that a process will continue until the early summer or maybe into the autumn and the Taoiseach does not envisage a final result in any of these three until possibly the autumn.</P>
      <P>The second issue relates to persons who prior to the ceasefire were involved in terrorist-related crime and are now on the run. I understand the position as far as Northern Ireland and Great Britain is concerned. Would the Taoiseach explain the Government policy in respect of persons who were members of the Provisional IRA or other proscribed organisations, who are suspected of having been involved in crimes in this jurisdiction prior to the ceasefire. Is there a Government policy? Are the files closed or are the Garda still actively seeking such persons? I could refer to a number of unresolved crimes where the Garda have names of persons and where there is forensic evidence to at least advance a <i>prima facie</i> case against suspects. Will negotiations relating to persons on the run for crimes committed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland cause legislation to be enacted in this jurisdiction, and is an amnesty being contemplated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to clear the issues relating to decommissioning and see further progress under de Chastelain. There must first of all be more re-engagement which I think will happen but I am not sure when. General de Chastelain will have to make a statement of how he sees the situation. It is his call. We must also wait and see how the First Minister and the Unionists generally would react to that. I hope we will see positive developments but I do not know if it will be totally positive or just a step in the right direction. It all depends on the extent of the engagement. If that proceeds, it opens up the way for demilitarisation to move onwards.</P>
      <P>The issue of policing will not be resolved before June because it is felt it would not be wise to include it in a British general election campaign. We should not allow the work to be delayed, however, because training of recruits will commence in the Autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan will recall where the issue of &ldquo;on the run persons&rdquo; originates. There are those who had been convicted of offences and received fairly lengthy sentences and had even served short periods of those sentences. Under the Good Friday Agreement, there was a two year period <Col N="59" /> after the date of ratification, June 1998, when they were all released except for two people. People who were not charged and the only evidence against them is hearsay have a problem that if they return to Northern Ireland they are unsure of their position. They would be covered by the Good Friday Agreement if they gave themselves up to the authorities in Northern Ireland and the same applies in this State. That issue remains an anomaly. Escapees are in a different category because they had been charged or were on remand. There are about 20 or 30 cases involving persons who were under suspicion by the security forces in the North or have known that they are on the list as in some well-known cases highlighted by the media during the year. They have not got a clearance. Efforts were made in the British system to deal with this. That has not been possible and more efforts are being made now to look at it. The question of an amnesty arises. The British will have to decide if that can be done through current legislation or whether new legislation is required. I think the latter is more likely.</P>
    <P>We have not closed the files in many cases, most of which the RUC and the Garda will continue to pursue, but suspects on the lists prior to April 1998, or effectively June of that year, the application date for those in prison, would be entitled to avail of the same amnesty. Whatever mechanism is used, they will not serve much time. It would have to be formally indicated that they were no longer being sought, but no files have been closed as of now. There have been cases where people have been arrested while others are still in process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person in the United States is afraid to return home because he or she was involved in a Provisional IRA offence in this jurisdiction prior to the ceasefire and fears being arrested at Shannon Airport when he or she returns, will the outcome of negotiations taking place in Northern Ireland in respect of those in a similar position apply in this jurisdiction? If so, what legal mechanism does the Government intend to use to provide for this? It will have to legislate. It is not enough to state that people might believe that they are suspected and that, if they return, they might be arrested. The same answer could be given to those who raise such concerns in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach will have to clear his head and clear the lines in the South before he can establish a negotiating position on the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="60" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Other than citing examples of cases, we will not establish a negotiating position on the North because that will be done by the British Government. There are about 24 or 25 cases in the North whereas there are none on our lists and none has been advanced. The reason is complex because there are different cases. There are those who were charged and prosecuted and escaped; those who were charged and never prosecuted; those who were arrested, were on remand and had not been prosecuted; and those who were suspected on hearsay evidence and about whom nothing happened. The last category represents the majority of cases. In our case, anyone who returns is likely to be arrested by the Garda. If it is for an offence, the privileges of the Good Friday Agreement will take effect as it has for all other such offences. At this stage no legislation is required but, if a case arose which was not covered by our law, we would have to legislate for it.</P>

        <b>:</b> I wish to ask the Taoiseach about his visit to the United States. When the Taoiseach met President Bush, was it all soft soap and plámás or did he raise serious issues and make serious criticisms of any aspects of US foreign or domestic policy? The Government will hold a referendum in a few months to outlaw the death penalty in the State. Did the Taoiseach feel creepy giving a bowl of Irish shamrock to a man responsible for 150 executions in the state of Texas? It is something many in this country find morally repugnant, especially as the system is highly racially discriminatory and increasingly discredited with many innocent people being found on death row, a source of international debate and scandal.</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach raise with President Bush the issue of the sanctions against Iraq, the toll they exact on innocent human life, especially children, and the destruction caused to the social fabric and infrastructure of that country while not scathing the dictatorial leadership? Did he discuss the prospects for the US economy and the fact that a recession beckons in the largest capitalist economy on the globe with serious profit warnings by major multinational US based companies? Was there any discussion of this prospect and how it might impact on the tens of thousands of Irish workers employed in Ireland by affiliates of those multinationals?</P>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach lobbied by anyone on behalf of the United States administration on any issues relating to the United Nations, especially where our position on the Security Council is concerned, or European Union economic or security issues? If so, what were they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that Deputy Higgins will be no easier on this President than he was on the previous one. Discussions were centred primarily on bilateral issues and our bilateral relationships. The aim was to improve those relationships, to take up where we had left off <Col N="61" /> with the previous administration, to try to strengthen the relationships and use them to mutual advantage. The Iraqi sanctions will be debated in the House tomorrow when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will answer questions on the subject. We discussed a range of issues, the sanctions being one. I had an opportunity to obtain the President's views on a wide-ranging number of issues which he was glad to give me. We discussed environmental issues because they had arisen that morning in the context of the reports about Kyoto. I raised those issues to determine his precise attitude and what was happening in that regard. We discussed what would happen in the discussions on the Middle East. Mr Colin Powell and Ms Condoleesa Rice were present and participated in the discussions. We also discussed Russia and Africa, especially the AIDS issue in which the President has an interest.</P>
      <P>We spent most of our time discussing Northern Ireland and the American and Irish economies. The President is an informed person who is well briefed on what has happened here and has a clear mind about what he wishes to do. He informed me that he will attend the European Council in Sweden in June and give his views on European matters. I spent about an hour and 15 minutes with him at lunch and about the same length of time the following day. I had an opportunity to engage in a very extensive discussion with him on a range of issues. I was not lobbied on any issue. Neither was any of my delegation.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach in expressing satisfaction that progress is apparently being achieved on policing. Does he, as I do, look forward to agreement being reached on a declining number of matters when it will be possible for the SDLP to fully endorse and support the new police service? In those circumstances, can we be assured that the SDLP will have the full support of the Government as, I hope, it has the full support of all democratic parties in the House in order that the Government and any possible alternative to it may fully support the SDLP on this issue which requires courageous decisions?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said, concerning Sinn Féin, that policing issues have been comprehensively addressed in recent months. What are the main sticking points as far as Sinn Féin is concerned? Does the Taoiseach share the opinion many have expressed that Sinn Féin is not keen to come to terms with this issue and has no intention of asking its people to support any police service in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to consider the appeal of the Omagh victims' league for financial support in taking civil actions against those believed to be responsible for the Omagh <Col N="62" /> bombing? Is he prepared to support a plea to help them financially in that respect?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concern that, despite the moves the IRA has made to get in touch with General de Chastelaine, it stated that the meeting was to set the basis for discussions? Does the Taoiseach agree that, while this move is welcome, it is a very small move and the IRA needs to proceed from that very quickly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All parties are anxious to find resolutions to the remaining difficulties. It is unfair to say that the parties are not trying. Perhaps some parties have made more progress than others but all are trying. It has been a key objective to reach a point where the SDLP moves to recommend acceptance of the new police service in Northern Ireland &ndash; both to its party and to its community. The aim is to move with the SDLP toward that goal. We helped it in any way we could during the long passage of the legislation in Westminster and we continue with that help. We have moved close to a position from where we can make progress on this, and the other matters raised earlier by Deputy Quinn relating to the legislative base in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>On the Omagh issue and related cases, we are sympathetic. How the legal position will work out, I do not know, but our secretariat has been following that issue. I have not had a recent update on the matter but we continue to give it our attention and support. The security and intelligence efforts related to the Omagh bombing continue. I was asked recently about this and I take this opportunity to confirm that the efforts that were being made by the Garda are still being made and that will continue.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said to Deputy Sargent about the IRA meeting General de Chastelaine. It was a minimum move and the intention is that there will be further engagement. Deputy Sargent asked if that engagement would be this week and I do not know the answer to that. The meeting was the contact that was required. It got over a previous difficulty that there had been a telephone contact between the IRA and the de Chastelaine commission but nothing further.</P>
      <P>However, there has been movement. The two Governments and all the parties were anxious that this would be a formal meeting and an official commencement of the operation. The matter has now progressed to the detail of how to move the process, and of trying to achieve what was set out by the IRA in its statement of 6 May 2000 in response to the 5 May 2000 statement by the pro-Agreement parties. I hope meetings to work on detailed matters will be arranged soon as that is the key to really making progress.</P>

      <P>On the Taoiseach's visit to the United States he met the Ireland and American economic advisory board. Did the Taoiseach raise with the board the issue of the many US firms, such as Gateway and Intel, who have indicated job losses in Ireland? I refer especially to Intel <Col N="63" /> who have stood down the work force constructing their FAB 24 building at Leixlip with the loss of 1,500 jobs. Did the Taoiseach raise these issues and the concerns of the Irish work force about redundancies in American based firms operating in Ireland?</P>

      <P>It is a delay to the FAB 24 project and not an abandonment. We are lucky to have companies like Intel here, when we look at what is happening in many areas of Europe and the world. I discussed the economic situation when I met the economic advisory group. There has been a major downturn for dotcom and technology companies. One senior executive at the meeting pointed out that in 1999, £12 billion was put into the marketing and advancement of dotcom companies. Last year that figure was down to £7 billion and this year £1 billion is projected. The effect across an economy is easily seen.</P>
      <P>From an Irish perspective, the key thing is to remain competitive and to hold as much of the market share as we can. The excellent productivity of our work force is needed to get through what will be a difficult period. The fall-off in stocks for many of the medium to large size companies has been 60% since the Christmas period so there will clearly be a major slowdown. The advice of the economic advisory group is that while it is impossible to predict the length of any slowdown, it will certainly include the first half of this year, which will be a cautious period. That was the collective advice of what was a large turnout at the advisory group meeting.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the chairman of the National Salmon Commission resigned; his views on whether he has undermined the authority of the National Salmon Commission by intervening in localised disputes concerning logbooks; the reason sufficient notice was not taken concerning the opposition to aspects of this new legislation before it was introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with regret that I accepted the resignation recently of the chairman of the National Salmon Commission. I take this opportunity to inform the House of my decision to appoint Mr. Joey Murrin as chairman. Mr. Murrin has a distinguished record of service in the fisheries sector and has the experience to work with all interests on the commission to tackle the many issues affecting the salmon resource. I wish him and the commission well and I look forward to an early meeting of the commission to begin the process of collective engagement on the key issues.</P>
      <P>On 8 February, I informed the House of my decision that the amount of information to be supplied by salmon anglers with their logbook returns will be reduced forthwith. I made this decision following discussions with the Federation of Irish Salmon and Sea Trout Anglers and others regarding their concerns relating to the wild salmon tagging scheme. I wrote to the chairman on 12 February advising the commission of my decision. I requested him to convene a meeting of the commission at the earliest opportunity to progress discussions on logbook requirements in light of my decision for 2001 and looking ahead to 2002, and to move ahead on priority salmon conservation issues.</P>
      <P>In a letter to me dated 1 March 2000, the chairman advised that he was not in a position to call a meeting of the commission and asked me to accept his resignation, unless I felt that the commission need not be called on to advise further regarding the logbooks for 2001.</P>
      <P>The legal framework for the wild salmon tagging scheme is provided for in regulations under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999. To put into legal effect my decision on logbook returns an amending regulation is required. The legislation also provides that before I may make this amending regulation I must consult the National Salmon Commission in addition to a public consultation period of 30 days. Apart from legal and procedural considerations, I am anxious to see the commission membership engaging constructively without further delay on all the priority salmon conservation issues as well as tagging and logbook requirements. In the circumstances I have accepted the chairman's resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tagging regulations were discussed at length by the commission in the spring and summer of 2000. On the recommendation of the commission itself, the draft regulations were amended to increase the amount of information relating to <Col N="65" /> fishing effort to be recorded by anglers in the logbooks.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The regulations which I signed in August 2000 incorporated this and other recommendations made by the commission. FISSTA is represented on the commission and no objection was recorded regarding the logbooks. Concerns regarding certain aspects of the logbook effectively surfaced at the start of the year. To build confidence in the tagging scheme, which has been debated in this House and generally welcomed by all sides, I have moved quickly to take the necessary action to deal with these concerns.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the valuable contribution the former chairman made to progressing the salmon agenda in general and during his time as chairman of the commission. He chaired the salmon management task force which reported in 1996. The recommendations of this task force form the basis of the various salmon management strategies being progressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister introduced the legislation on salmon tagging, he went to great lengths to point out the independence of the salmon commission and we all agreed with the great tribute he paid to the commission. He said its independence meant that its proposals should be taken seriously and it was stated on several occasions during Committee Stage that they were the best available. It was stated that, in the overall context, the proposals corresponded to what should be happening in the industry.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree his involvement undermined the commission's independence? He took it upon himself to take certain action and it is debatable whether that action was right or wrong. If some of the participants in the salmon tagging scheme had behaved like others, they would not have to do what they are doing now. Does the Minister agree his decision shattered the future independence of the salmon commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasised the commission's independence in the past and I will continue to do so. However, it is an advisory group to the Minister; that is its function. My view was that it was necessary to avoid a complete breakdown in a considerable section of the salmon angling community which had refused to tag salmon. Their case was that the amount of information required in the log book was onerous. On the basis of an understanding from them that they were prepared to tag all salmon, which is the most important requirement, it was decided the information in the log books for this year would be only a record of the salmon tagged. In the interest of trying to find agreement, I made a decision, which I put to the commission for its consideration, to reduce the amount of information required on the log book to a record of the salmon caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> The chairman was not happy with that decision and informed me that he could not continue under such circumstances. It was with regret that I accepted his resignation. However, we had a fundamental disagreement. He felt the way to deal with the problem of anglers who were not prepared to tag was recourse to the law. My view was that this would not be an appropriate way forward. I did not want fisheries officers having to give out summonses in an effort to sort out the problem. I am satisfied the proposed way forward is the best option and that everybody is united. I am also satisfied the commission can deal with other important issues and that a significant problem has been overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's comment that everybody is happy with a grain of salt. When the legislation was going through the House, I asked the Minister if all the participants were in favour of the system. He said it was the commission's proposal and it was the right thing to do. The Minister has undermined the commission and its good work to date. In the future, if some sectors of the fishing community decide the scheme does not suit them, they will go directly to the Minister and bypass the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the UK became known, my Department put in place a comprehensive series of precautionary measures across a wide range of areas to help combat the threat of the disease. This was done in co-operation with other Departments and agencies and senior officials from my Department are playing an active role, on an ongoing basis, in the high level task force set up by the Government under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. A number of general measures were immediately taken. Disinfection mats were provided at the entrances to departmental offices and all non-essential meetings involving travel to and from Northern Ireland were cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the forestry side, all site inspections by forestry inspectors have been suspended since 27 February. My Department is currently in discussion with the Department of Agriculture, <Col N="67" /> Food and Rural Development on this issue in the context of the expert group's recommendations. This group was set up by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to advise on limited relaxation of initial measures taken to combat the spread of the disease within Ireland. In the meantime, inspections of Coillte roads and reconstruction sites continue on the strict understanding that such visits do not involve entering on to or crossing any farm land. All forestry contractors and consultants have been advised in writing that, when entering and leaving farms, they and their machinery should be thoroughly disinfected.</P>
    <P>Preventing entry of the disease from the UK is the primary concern. In relation to commercial seaports, all the port companies and harbour authorities have put in place appropriate disinfection, notification procedures and preventative measures in strict accordance with Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development advice. My officials are also in ongoing direct communication with the seaports and relevant shipping companies to assist the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in monitoring the situation on the ground in our own ports and relevant seaports in the UK and France. In this context, my Department is in regular contact with UK Departments with a view to ensuring that all measures are taken to disinfect persons and vehicles leaving the UK for Ireland. Precautionary measures were also put into place at the five fishery harbour centres managed by my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Environment and Local Government, as well as the Customs and Excise, is developing a long-term plan to ensure an adequate arrangement is in place to deal with all the potential entry points at small piers, landing places, mooring buoys, etc., where yachts and other small leisure craft may enter when the tourist angling season starts.</P>
    <P>In relation to mining activity, I have requested all holders of prospecting licences to refrain from fieldwork and have deferred contract works entailing field visits in agricultural lands.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Steps have also been taken in the area of aquaculture. The industry has been told that movements of fish within the country must be kept to an absolute minimum and consignments must be accompanied by authorisation from my Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of angling, I made a by-law prohibiting angling nationwide with effect from 3 March. While this measure was consistent with the overall precautionary approach adopted by the Government, I was nevertheless aware that this restriction placed a considerable burden on the angling sector, which is particularly vulnerable due to the niche nature of many enterprises. <Col N="68" /> At the earliest opportunity, therefore, my Department sought the advice of the expert group in relation to foot and mouth disease controls. On 16 March my Department received the recommendations of the expert group, which allow for the lifting of the legal prohibition on angling with effect from 23 March. My Department is issuing guidelines which will be applicable to all involved in the angling sector from 23 March.</P>
    <P>Angling activity may resume from 23 March subject to non-entry onto agricultural land to which animals susceptible to the disease may have had access since 1 February 2001. It is hoped this easing of the restrictions will allow for the resumption of ordinary angling activity in many cases, in particular lake and sea angling. Unfortunately, however, it remains the case that visiting anglers from the UK and other infected areas should be discouraged. I will continue to monitor the need for, and effect of, the current restrictions in consultation with my Government colleagues and with the advice of the expert group.</P>

What further measures, if any, will continue to apply to people using shipping and port companies? Does he intend to review the measures and, if so, when will that happen?</P>

      <P>In the case of angling, I made a by-law prohibiting angling nationwide with effect from 3 March. Last week it was decided to lift this ban on angling from Friday next, assuming there is no outbreak in the meantime. A national advertising campaign advised angling clubs of the requirements and, following the lifting of the ban, a number of regulations and protocols will be introduced. These will forbid anglers entering land. They may go to angling venues only via public access points such as piers, bridges, etc. They will not be allowed to cross land.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the way in which anglers and the angling community acted so responsibly over the past number of weeks. It has been particularly difficult for sporting anglers and even more difficult for the angling tourism fraternity who had to close their businesses. They acted responsibly and I am glad the ban can be lifted. However, I urge people to continue implementing the regulations, protocols and precautions that will be advertised in the coming week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding shipping, the same precautions are encouraged at all points of entry, particularly from Great Britain. People are asked to use disinfectant mats, etc. Any travellers who have been on farms are requested to report at the point of entry to the personnel from Customs and Excise <Col N="69" /> and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <P>Precautionary measures were put in place at all fishery harbour centres as soon as the foot and mouth disease problem in the UK became known. The centres are located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel, and Killybegs. Harbour masters at all of the five harbours were instructed to take immediate action.</P>
      <P>Notices about the disease were erected at all of the harbours requiring any vessel arriving from outside of the State to inform the harbour master and carry out necessary procedures for prevention of the spread of the disease. The notice requires crew members to remain on board vessels until the necessary procedures are completed. Specific disinfectant mats are provided at the gangways of all vessels from visiting countries and for all Irish vessels which have visited foreign ports. In addition and critically, all food wastes originating outside of the country must be retained on board the vessel until suitable arrangements are made for proper disposal. The usual arrangements involving the provision of disinfectant mats for pedestrians and motor vehicles are also in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to landings into other harbours, my Department has been in contact with coastal local authorities advising them to put in place stringent precautionary measures at harbours and landing places under their control. My officials are in regular contact with the fishing industry and I am not aware of any loss of earnings to Irish fishermen arising from the food and mouth disease threat. There is ongoing liaison between my Department, the harbour masters at the fishery harbour centres, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and cus<Col N="70" /> toms officials to ensure that the procedures in place are appropriate and effective. The arrangements are kept under constant review and my officials will take all additional action considered necessary to ensure that the activities at the fishery harbour centres do not pose a risk of bringing the disease into Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>Forestry incentives consist of afforestation grants and premium payments for loss of income. The afforestation grants are paid in two instalments in years one and four and cover the capital cost of setting up a forestry plantation. The same rates apply to farmers and non-farmers. Loss of income premiums are payable to farmers over 20 years. A lower level of premium, payable over 15 years, is paid to non-farmers. The level of premiums is determined largely by the species planted.</P>
      <P>The planting targets are set out in the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector in Ireland, published in July 1996. The plan envisaged a planting target of 25,000 hectares per annum up to end of 2000 and 20,000 hectares per annum thereafter. Following discussions with the European Commission, I was pleased to announce in March last significant increases, averaging 30%, in the rates of annual forest premium for those planting from 1 October 1999. In the case of farmers planting broad leaf trees &ndash; oak and beech &ndash; in severely handicapped areas, for example, the annual premium increased from £265 to £373 per hectare. For farmers planting 20% diverse conifers, the premium increased from £210 to £308 per hectare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of the increased incentives in respect of planting for pre-October 1999 was an <Col N="71" /> essential element of the case submitted to the European Commission in August 1999. From the beginning the Commission had indicated that this aspect would be problematic. It was unwilling at that time to co-fund similar increases for those who planted in earlier years. I and my Department made a further detailed submission to the Commission in April 2000 in support of such increases and I vigorously pursued this case at a number of meetings with the Commission in the latter half of last year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The question of applying the increase to those who had planted in the period 1993-2000 was the subject of protracted discussions at all levels with the Commission. Various arguments were advanced by the Commission in addition to legal factors, for example, the precedent on other agricultural schemes and budgetary considerations. In spite of cogent arguments, regrettably, the Commission remained steadfast in its refusal to co-fund the increases.</P>
    <P>Application of the 30% increase to pre-1999 planting would give a much needed boost in terms of confidence for the sector, in meeting the targets in our afforestation programme and in delivering on the forestry elements of the national climate change strategy. It is for that reason that I am now considering possible funding from the Exchequer, at an estimated annual cost at present of £3.4 million, for those who planted prior to 1 October 1999. The number of landowners involved, mainly farmers, is approximately 12,000. In view of the State aids aspect, any decision to have the cost borne by the Exchequer would require Commission agreement. As I indicated to the House on 8 February in reply to Deputy Connaughton, I hope to be in a position to announce a decision during the current planting season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the frankness of the Deputy's question and, as always, I will be as direct as I can in my reply. Approximately 12,000 people have planted. Some £3.4 million per annum is involved. That will apply from 1999. I have argued my position in Brussels on a number of occasions. We will not get the extra money from the Commission on the basis that it maintains the farmers signed an agreement for a certain level <Col N="72" /> of premium grant. Consequently, it will not agree to anything further.</P>
      <P>I discussed the position with the Minister and the officials in my Department and made a case to the Department of Finance. The Government has not made a decision, but I hope we will not have to wait another three or four months for one. A response is imminent. I do not like saying that because I may have given a similar indication on the last occasion. I am sorry if I did because, more than anyone else, I would like a positive response.</P>
      <P>The case has been made to the Department. I understand it will be on the Minister's desk within a week. I hope the result will be the one we all seek. If we get the positive answer from the Department of Finance we must then get agreement from the EU Commission because it could regard it as a State aid.</P>

It appears that, even in the media, there is an acceptance by many farmers that the Government has taken a decision. I emphasise, as has the Minister of State, that a decision has not been taken and until such time as the Cabinet makes a decision they will be as far away from receiving the money as they were a year ago. I hope we do not have to await the onslaught of a general election before it is announced. I believe the Minister of State accepts the farmers should be paid.

The Department of Finance is looking at this very seriously. However, no decision has been taken by the Government as yet.</P>

      <P>I have explained in detail, in my earlier reply to Deputy Connaughton, the background to this matter. I am sure Deputy Sheehan will accept that.</P>
      <P>I am now considering possible funding from the Exchequer, at an estimated annual cost at present of £3.4 million, for those who planted prior to 1 October 1999. In view of the State aids aspect &ndash; I emphasise this &ndash; any decision to have the cost borne by the Exchequer would also require the agreement of the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will agree that since the introduction of forestry measures under CAP, 80,000 hectares have been planted by more than 10,000 farmers. These farmers are the key to the future development of forestry but they will not receive the increased level of premium. It is estimated that £4.5 million annually would cover all farmers who planted before October 1999 and whose premiums are still being paid. Such people were the pioneers of the forestry industry. They planted their land when the premium was very low and they should be safeguarded now. The Minister of State mentioned £3.4 million in his reply. It is small beer in the tiger economy at a time when the country is awash with money. I have no doubt the Minister of State will get the co-operation of the Cabinet to include such farmers.</P>

      <P>I am not yet in the Cabinet but I have a very eminent Minister who plays his part in the Cabinet. Nothing is got easily and the reason we have a tiger economy is nothing was let slip. However, in this case, as the Deputy said, the pioneers planted land up to 1999. They should be recognised and acknowledged for doing so but they signed an agreement. One of the weaknesses of the plan in 1996 was no provision was made for an increase. In the new increases I succeeded in getting last March, I included a three yearly review. From now on, we will not have the same difficulty as we had prior to 1999. I will make as strong a case as I can, aided and abetted by the Minister, Deputy Fahey. We are in touch with the Department of Finance. I do not want to make the same speech to Deputy Connaughton again next month.</P>

      <P>The number of persons appointed to State boards, task forces or committees since my appointment as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in January 2000 is 135, of which 27 per cent were women.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on the Development of Port Estates in Commercial Harbours was launched on 28 February 2001. The membership announced to date comprises persons with expert knowledge and experience in the fields of port and property management, economics and law. I am currently considering possible further appointments to the task force before its first substantive meeting early next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is committed to gender balance, why are the ten members appointed to the task force on port estates all men? Has the Government changed its policy on gender balance on State boards? The percentage of female representation on State boards decreased in the lifetime of this Government and <Col N="75" /> two recent announcements would suggest there is a change of policy. Apart from this Minister's appointment of ten men out of the ten members of the task force on port estates, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, recently appointed the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission and there was only one woman among its seven members . Campus Ireland, the overall body in that regard, has only two women members out of a total of 11. This Minister's appointment to the task force wins the prize as regards lack of female representation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister may be adding to that number. Is the Government committed to the policy of gender equality on State boards? Does the Minister intend to appoint women in his further consideration of the task force on port estates? Will he bring to Cabinet the fact that there does not seem to be a seriousness about achieving the percentages that are, as we are led to believe, part of Government policy? There seems to have been a serious slippage in this area.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's point regarding the port estates task force. It is the intention to appoint women to this task force. I accept it was remiss of me not to include women at the outset. However, I found it difficult to get women who are prepared to serve. Quite a number of women turn down positions offered to them. I wish to include women on all committees, task forces, boards and so on that I appoint. I appointed two excellent women to the Central Fisheries Board and to harbour authorities throughout the country. I must accept that I was not as successful on this occasion. However, I am still seeking to appoint suitable women to this board. It is a specialist board, requiring specialist qualifications and knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the grace with which the Minister responded. The chairperson of the board is an economist. Given that the board includes architects, engineers, a solicitor and people from various professions, I cannot understand why suitable women are not available to serve on it. The National Women's Council has drawn up lists of suitable women for various positions. If the Minister makes it clear that he is serious about appointing women, he will not have a problem attracting suitable women for appointment to this board and to other boards. Women have proved right across the board their suitability for appointment to these positions. It is a bit disingenuous of the Minister to say he could not find suitable women on this occasion.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department received correspondence from Wicklow County Council on 20 November 2000 outlining proposals for Greystones Harbour and the north beach; if so, his views on these proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7612/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr Fahey Mr Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to correspondence dated 20 November 2000 which the Wicklow county manager addressed to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and which was copied to my Department. The correspondence outlined a profile of the project currently being promoted by Wicklow County Council which involves development of the Greystones Harbour and north beach area involving, among other things, a marina, coastal protection works and a residential development.</P>
      <P>I understand the council, in copying the correspondence to my Department, has made specific proposals for changes in the tax code by the Minister for Finance which the council believes will assist in attracting financial backers whose participation is crucial to the project's success. In particular, these proposals are aimed at amending current tax incentive schemes to include marina developments and coastal protection works approved by my Department. At present my Department's role in approving coastal developments is confined to issuing foreshore leases under the Foreshore Acts, 1933-88. The foreshore lease focuses primarily on the physical effect of the development and involves consultation, planning permission and a public notice process.</P>
      <P>The general direction for marine tourism development for the next six years is set in the national development plan and more specifically the marine tourism grant scheme which will be administered by my Department. The grant scheme, which is currently being developed in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation for launch later this year, will be targeted at improving marine tourism access infrastructure and encouraging integrated development and co-operative partnerships, particularly in relation to networks and clusters.</P>
      <P>While I would generally support the project being promoted by Wicklow County Council, particularly as it appears to be broadly in line with the criteria my Department will set down under the forthcoming scheme, nevertheless, I must stress that the proposals put forward in relation to amendments to the tax code are entirely a matter for the Minister for Finance. My Department has no role in pursuing such proposals. It has, however, indicated to the Greystones Harbour Plan Liaison Committee that it will be happy to look at any draft terms of reference which might be drawn up for a tax implications study aimed at examining this issue more closely, focusing in particular on the inclusion of elements in such projects which meet public policy objectives such as coast protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Is he aware that at present <Col N="77" /> Greystones Harbour is suffering from coastal erosion, which is a difficulty along the east coast? There is an opportunity to have the work carried out without a cost to the Exchequer <i>per se</i>, while the council has indicated it is willing to make a contribution in kind by way of a site. Is the Minister aware of the proposal to develop a community harbour as opposed to a marina? The proposal is for 280 berths and the Irish coastguard sea scouts and anglers are seeking a public park. I am pleased the Minister indicated that he will consider positively any application from Wicklow County Council. Will he confirm that he believes the project is a good idea in principle? Will he use whatever influence he can at Cabinet to get the Minister for Finance to consider including Greystones for special tax designation in the next Finance Bill so that this project can go ahead? Greystones has never benefited from the town renewal, urban renewal or seaside resort schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue, in the first instance, is a matter for Wicklow County Council. My Department has invested heavily in Wicklow, while the biggest coastal erosion programme in the country is taking place in Bray. I am impressed with the whole concept proposed in respect of Greystones. I have had some discussions with the Minister for Finance on the general question of tax incentives for developments in coastal locations. In principle I support this type of proposal. However, this is a matter for the Minister for Finance, while the proposals being put forward are a matter for Wicklow County Council. I will be pleased to be supportive in whatever way possible.</P>

      <Quest>if funding will be provided by his Department in the 2001 Estimates for the planned extension and construction of a breakwater and other works to Schull Fishery Harbour, County Cork.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Schull Pier is owned by Cork County Council and its repair, maintenance and development is the responsibility of the local authority in the first instance. While Cork County Council is primarily responsible for the development of facilities at Schull, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources provides aid for development works at fishery harbours.</P>
      <P>The strategic fishery harbour in the west Cork area is Castletownbere, for which I recently announced a major development package. The development provides for an extension of the existing wharf at Dinnish Island, together with the construction of an auction hall. The planning application in respect of this development was lodged recently with Cork County Council and I hope the development will commence before the end of the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan provides, in total, £60 million for the upgrading and development of facilities at key strategic fishery harbours <Col N="78" /> and landing places. New and improved facilities will also be provided at smaller harbours and landing places, which will provide essential structures for the fishery and aquaculture industries. My Department has an extensive list of proposals for development works, comprising projects submitted for consideration by local authorities and industry sources. These projects are considered and approved on a priority basis.</P>
    <P>No proposals have been submitted by Cork County Council for the extension of a breakwater at Schull Pier. The scope for funding works at Schull will be kept under review by my Department in consultation with Cork County Council in light of available resources in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate and welcome the Minister's reply as far as Castletownbere is concerned, I am sure he realises there are more fishing ports in south-west Cork than Castletownbere. Schull is a very important fishing port with at least eight to ten trawler owners tying up in the harbour every weekend. I remind the Minister that this Government and previous Governments were very generous towards Union Hall fisheries harbour development which is now an excellent fisheries harbour in south-west Cork.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that Cork County Council has not been in communication with the Department on the construction of a breakwater and extension of the pier in Schull. I understood following a meeting nine months ago with the fisheries section of Cork County Council that this proposal had gone to the Department, which the Minister says is not the case. However, there might be light at the end of the tunnel given that £60 million is being provided to upgrade and develop fishery harbours and landing places.</P>
      <P>Schull, a predominant fishing port, is the only fishing harbour of which I am aware where trawler owners cannot tie up their vessels at the pier because of a lack of a breakwater in the harbour. It is of paramount importance that an allocation should be given to this area under the special fund that will be set up for the development of fisheries harbours throughout the country. The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, spent a considerable amount of money in recent years in Dunmore East and in other areas in his constituency.</P>

      <P>While I am anxious to shine a little light at the end of the tunnel for the Deputy, there are times when he tries to put in a bulb that is too strong, in the case of Castletownbere. I take the point he made. Irrespective of the number of pier projects one would like to undertake, one <Col N="79" /> must prioritise them. It is especially significant that work is proceeding in Castletownbere, as are other smaller developments along the coast of south-west Cork.

I remind the Minister that the last time work was done in Schull it resulted from a visit to the area by Garret FitzGerald who took an interest in it and indicated that an application for the work would be favourably considered. That was in the 1980s. I encourage the Minister in the short time he has left in office to pay a visit to Schull and talk to the local fishermen who have talked to me and highlighted the need for further work to be done there. If he cannot give a green light at this stage, I ask him to give an amber one that might correspond with an application for the work from the county council, in which case progress could be made on the necessary work required in Schull. I encourage him to visit Schull to check the work that is required and to talk to the local fishermen following which he will understand the need for the work to be carried out.</P>

      <P>While my Department has had some discussions with Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited and Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Ltd., on the development of the Corrib gas field, all substantive discussions have been with Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, which is the operator for the petroleum exploration licence covering the Corrib field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Information and data concerning the proposed development of the field is submitted to my Department by the operator on an ongoing basis. Regular meetings are held with the operator on the development plans for Corrib.</P>
    <P>Recently, having declared the field commercial, Enterprise Energy Ireland submitted information in support of an application for a petroleum lease with a view to its development.

    <P>I expect to grant a petroleum lease shortly to the partners. Within two years of the grant of the petroleum lease, the lessee is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field. This detailed plan of development must include information on the design, siting, construction, establishment, operation, abandonment and removal of any facilities for the production, processing, storage, or transportation of petroleum produced under the petroleum lease. An environmental impact statement is also required.

As the sole Cabinet member from the west, the Minister has succeeded in ensuring that the gas pipeline will travel along the west coast down as far as Galway city. Have any discussions taken place between Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited and officials of his Department or the Minister regarding the extension of such a gas pipeline throughout the western region in light of the economic significance that would have and the fact that Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited has to apply to the Minister for a licence to carry out works on that field?</P>

      <P>That is a separate issue. My colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, announced that in addition to the pipeline to which the Deputy referred serving the west, including Mayo and Galway, a separate development will also serve the north-west. It is the Government's intention to ensure a pipeline network is laid in the west and north west to serve, as far as possible, the major towns in that area. It is important to point out that every town in Ireland cannot be served with gas, as that would not be economic. Consequently, there must be an economic element to the provision of any pipeline. In the case of the north-west, the Government decided it will subsidise the provision a pipeline to the north-west to bring gas to that region and towns such as Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry will be served along a pipeline from Pollatomish to Craughwell.</P>

Will the Minister agree that for regions, especially the BMW region, to develop and attract industry, the potential for development does not exist unless there is access to gas? Will he agree that, since the Government has agreed to provide a pipeline to the north-west and to the west coast, the area in between, Roscommon to Sligo, should also be served? Will the Minister give a commitment to investigate the feasibility of doing that, even though it is not economically viable, and to extend gas to the regions, spanning Roscommon to Longford and over as far as Cavan, in the interest of developing those regions?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Final Report of the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft, which was presented to me in April 2000, recommended the introduction of a new legislative framework to allow for the enactment by local authorities of by-laws to control the use of jet skis and fast power craft as an initial step and for regulations on national provisions governing the safe use of such craft.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this legislative framework has now been achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which were included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000. As a result of these amendments, I, as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, am empowered to introduce statutory regulations to take account not only of the safety of recreational craft, including jet skis and fast power craft, and their occupants, but the safety of other persons resulting which could be affected by the use of the craft and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage. Significantly, as Minister, I am also empowered to provide local authorities and bodies with the power to introduce by-laws to control the use of such craft in areas under their jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently in the process of drafting regulations which will allow for the enactment of such by-laws. These regulations will also include,<i> inter alia</i>, provisions relating to age restrictions, the carriage and use of life jackets, restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs as well as provisions relating to careless and danger<Col N="82" /> ous driving of jet skis and fast power craft. It is my intention that these draft regulations will be finalised shortly in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, so that their implementation will be achieved in time for the coming summer season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. I tabled this question because this is a parochial matter in the Minister's constituency, where a young man from County Roscommon was killed in the backwash of a speed boat on the River Corrib. His mother has been campaigning to ensure the necessary safety measures are put in place on the River Corrib and on other rivers throughout the country. Can the Minister guarantee these by-laws will be in place by the summer? While I do not doubt he will ensure the regulations are introduced I cannot see how local authorities will have by-laws passed and enacted for the summer. Will the Minister assure the House that this will happen?</P>

      <P>The by-laws will be in place by the summer. The policing of by-laws is a matter for the local authorities. I emphasise that people should act responsibly. The majority of youths, especially those attached to boating and sports clubs, do so. It is only a small number who will act outside the law. For the first time we will have by-laws and regulations in place and I am satisfied that they will improve the situation significantly.</P>

      <P>The new round of investment support measures for the fishing fleet and the broader seafood industry is close to finalisation. An unprecedented level of funding, totalling £171 million, will underpin overall investment strategies for the sector under the National Develop<Col N="83" /> ment Plan 2000-2006. As the Deputy will appreciate, the significant difficulties which have emerged in relation to labour shortages combined with declines in fish stocks are factors which had to be considered in bringing this initiative to fruition. In this climate we must ensure short and long-term strategies are targeted to secure the viability and competitiveness of the fleet now and into the future.</P>
      <P>My Department is working with BIM to finalise the detailed grant schemes which will strategically focus on the enhancement of the safety, quality and competitiveness of the whitefish fleet. Investment schemes to assist in the purchase of new and modern second-hand vessels and in modernisation of existing vessels and purchase and installation of life saving equipment will be included in the new programme. A special scheme to assist younger fishermen acquiring a vessel for the first time will be an important element of the new initiative.</P>
      <P>EU State aid approval has been sought for the fleet investment measures and negotiations with the European Commission are nearing completion. I intend to announce details of the new fleet modernisation programme once this approval has been secured.</P>

It is a credit to my Department, my predecessors and BIM that we achieved such huge success with the whitefish fleet renewal programme now coming to a conclusion. I am anxious to get the new scheme off the ground as quickly as possible. This will be done in the very near future. I have to take cognisance of the fact, however, that stocks are declining, that there are increased pressures on fishermen, that the situation in regard to crews is becoming exceedingly difficult and that any new scheme should not place the livelihoods of those who will invest in significant new or second-hand boats in jeopardy. We have to be absolutely sure that they will be <Col N="84" /> viable. Consequently, I am satisfied that the extra time taken to put this scheme in place has been well worthwhile.</P>

      <Quest>if he is concerned with regard to the high level of fatalities and accidents on fishing vessels; if applications for grant aid for safety equipment or measures on fishing boats have been accepted by his Department during the last year; and if he will now put in place such a safety scheme as a matter of urgency.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the high level of fatalities and accidents on fishing vessels. I am very conscious that our fishermen go about their daily work in an often hostile and dangerous environment. The safety of fishermen is a matter to be addressed primarily by skippers, owners and crews. That being said, the State has done and will continue to persuade, support and coerce all persons involved in fishing to acquire equipment and adopt practices aimed at improving safety.</P>
      <P>My Department's priority has been to implement the recommendations and objectives of the fishing vessel safety review group. Considerable progress has been made in the areas of radio regulations, safety regulations for vessels over 24 metres, safety training, onshore marine radio communications, fleet modernisation, the establishment of a network of offshore weather and research buoys and safety awareness. Work is well advanced on draft safety regulations for smaller sizes of fishing boats. Following on from my announcement on 28 January that it was my intention to put in place new legislation which will see the introduction of mandatory safety training and mandatory wearing of suitable personal flotation devices for fishermen in Ireland, my Department will shortly commence a consultation process with the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the number of fatalities. I gather that there were about 30 fatalities at sea last year alone, almost all off the west and south west coast. I am concerned that, apart from the regulations, the system of grant aid which was available has dried up and that there is anticipation of a further scheme of grant aid. I have anecdotal evidence that certain safety measures are being delayed pending a new scheme. Will there be a new scheme of grant aid and, if so, when will it be introduced? Will the Minister introduce it straightaway in order that essential safety measures will not be further delayed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 in my name are being discussed with those in the <Col N="86" /> name of the Minister. We had a lengthy and useful debate on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I support in principle the provision of a share option scheme and the notion of taxing it at the capital gains tax rate of 20% rather than as benefit-in-kind at the income tax rate. I have no quarrel with the proposal that 70% of shares must be made available as part of the primary scheme. My quarrel is with the provision that up to 30% of shares can be set aside for certain workers.</P>
      <P>I support the notion of a share option scheme because I believe that encouraging stakeholding and profit sharing within companies is good. It gives employees a sense of ownership and belonging. If such a scheme works properly, employees are incentivised to work harder and to identify their interests with the interest of the company. It gives them a greater sense of loyalty and it makes it possible for the employer to retain key workers for a longer period. It also allows the employer in ideal circumstances to vary at least part of the reward given to workers according to how the company is performing at any given time. There are numerous good reasons to support share option schemes and financial participation generally by employees. These reasons underpin the minimum 70% of shares which the Minister provides for in the primary scheme.</P>
      <P>My difficulty is with the provision that 30% of shares can be set aside for key employees because the various other levelling out rules do not apply to it. It is not constrained in any way. There is no maximum in terms of the employee's other remuneration or monetary cap on the number of share options which can be given to an employee in any particular year. I am afraid the scheme will be abused. The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, abolished a similar scheme in 1992 because it was used as a means of legal tax avoidance by a relatively small number of people who gained enormously from it.</P>
      <P>My concern is that the scheme will be used and abused by a small number of well paid workers to avoid paying tax. I am also concerned that it will be used by employers as a means of side-stepping the Minister's abolition of the cap on employers' PRSI. Unfortunately, I cannot support the Minister's amendment for those reasons. It is entirely predictable that the scheme will be abused by people who are already extremely well paid. We should not consciously create a loophole to that effect. The Minister was open to these arguments on Committee Stage but was more persuaded that he should give the scheme a go. He is wrong to do so but if he is minded to go ahead he should still consider the possibility of reducing the percentage of shares that could be made available, capping it by reference to an overall monetary amount, say £10,000 or £15,000, in any given year or capping it by reference to an employee's remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): Deputy McDowell tabled these amendments on Committee Stage when we had a useful debate on the <Col N="87" /> various types of employee financial participation schemes, including profit-sharing, share options and gain-sharing. While we may differ on the specifics there is general agreement on the principle that incentives for employee financial participation in their employers' businesses is good. Amendment No. 36 seeks to modify the &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; rule by limiting the value of options exercised each year to one third of the employee's remuneration for that year. The &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; rule allows some differentiation between employees as regards the number of options granted to each on the basis of levels of remuneration and similar factors, but any such differentiation must be broadly proportionate.</P>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, I do not believe it is necessary or desirable to go further and impose a fixed monetary proportionality of 3:1 or any other ratio. There must be a reasonable degree of flexibility to make the new scheme a success. The existing &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; rule and the other conditions for Revenue approval should limit the scope for abuse in the form of artificial loading of options in favour of directors and higher-paid employees who are not key employees.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 proposes the scrapping of the key employee element of the new scheme. It is generally acknowledged that most companies tend to have a few key people who, because of their mix of skills and abilities, are vital to the company's success. This is especially true in many of the fast growing sectors such as software, electronics and health care which are crucial to Ireland's economic success. Other countries also recognise this in their tax codes. For example, the UK has a favourable tax regime for options granted to key employees.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the scheme, as constructed, requires that as share options given to key employees increase so also must the number given under the all-employee part of the scheme to maintain the 30:70 ratio. This will put a damper on any tendency to overly reward the higher paid at the expense of those on more modest levels of remuneration.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put that if a company wants to retain the services of a key employee the way to do so is to increase his or her salary and not expect the Exchequer to partially foot the Bill by reducing the tax rate applying to share options. I do not concur with this viewpoint. Increasing basic pay not only introduces wage inflexibility into remuneration systems for companies, it also puts companies, especially new start-up companies, in a position in which they can ill afford to be.</P>
    <P>The reality is that such companies cannot afford, as a fixed inflexible item, the salary levels which would be required and can then use the funds for more productive purposes. The advantage of using share options is that there is no impact on the company's cost base. The fall in high-tech share prices over the past six months <Col N="88" /> has demonstrated there is no absolute guarantee of any reward from these options but this is a risk employees must be prepared to face.</P>
    <P>The issue of an appropriate tax treatment of share options has been on the table for discussion for years and it is time to act. The scheme I propose is a reasonable compromise between the conflicting points of view on how to proceed. However, the House may be assured I have every intention of keeping the scheme under close review and if there is evidence that it is being abused I will not hesitate to make whatever changes are necessary to correct that. I cannot accept Deputy McDowell's amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the issue of whether the new scheme should apply to former employees and he suggested this may be contrary to the intention of relief, which is to retain staff. The scheme, as drafted, was intended to preclude former employees from exercising options granted while in employment. Representations have been made to me, notwithstanding that companies see share options schemes as a valuable tool for recruitment and retention of staff, that companies allow former employees to exercise options granted while in employment. Ruling out former employees from exercising such options would, therefore, be too restrictive and debar such schemes.</P>
    <P>The normal period allowed for exercise by former employees in the case of multinationals is in the region of 90 days and the IAIM guidelines permit longer periods. Such schemes also have arrangements for those who leave for reasons of disability. I emphasise this is facilitative only and is not mandatory. My amendments mean that legislation does not rule out schemes where the company considers it appropriate to allow some leeway to former employees.</P>
    <P>We have had a good debate on this issue on Committee Stage for the past three years. It is time to do something in this area. The debate about share options has been around for some time. As Deputy McDowell correctly pointed out, we had a generous share option scheme between 1986 and 1992 until the former Minister for Finance and current Taoiseach abolished it. He did so for good reasons. The scheme was used extensively by a small group, and a small number of financial institutions in particular, to reward some of their better paid employees. The then Minister abandoned it in the 1992 Finance Act. This matter has been debated for some time and came up during the recently concluded PPF, when a group was set up. It is impossible to get universal agreement as to how we should proceed and I decided, as I told the committee, to go in this direction. It is not the last we will hear about share options and as I said, I intend to keep the matter under review. I expect to come back to this matter so let us see how it operates.</P>
    <P>Like many provisions in the Finance Bill this is the result of a series of compromises and there is some legitimacy in some of Deputy McDowell's arguments. We talked for long enough about put<Col N="89" /> ting something on the statute book and I am not saying we cannot talk further about it but it is about time to see how it operates in this climate. I am assured it is a key part of retaining employees and of ensuring higher growth levels for Ireland. Those advocating share option schemes suggested such schemes were the key to ensuring parts of the globe became economic dynamos and that we should do the same here. I am convinced by those arguments but I am not saying the scheme we have come up with is the last word on this. I have made more and more changes to the ESOP legislation with each Finance Bill I have introduced and I am now so confused that I will have to get a day-long tutorial from the Revenue Commissioners to explain it. It has become confusing and hard to follow because of the changes I have had to make, though I hope we will not have to do that again. Let us see how this operates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister on this. I do not have a difficulty with share options in principle. Neither do I have a difficulty with companies trying to hold on to key employees. I just cannot see why it cannot be done within the &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; rules; those rules could be made more flexible but capped, so that one could not have a person literally taking a multiple of his or her salary out of a company year on year. That would be an abuse.</P>
      <P>Share options should be an extra incentive and a bonus and should ideally be profit-related but they should not be a replacement for a huge chunk of income. If one is earning £30,000 one should not be able to take out £40,000 to £60,000 in a given year. I accept most people will not do so and that the vast majority of those who benefit from the scheme will take out a proportionate amount. However, I am sure there will be a small number of well-paid employees who will benefit enormously from this. They will effectively have an enormous part of their income taxed at 20% when they should be paying 42%.</P>
      <P>We will not reach agreement on this issue though the Minister is conscious even now that he will have to come back on this matter. Within a very short time we will see this is being abused by a small number of people.</P>

      <P>These amendments propose to amend section 29 which provides relief for fees paid for third level education. The amendments tidy up drafting errors. Amendment No. 39 inserts the number into the start of the section which was previously omitted, while amendment No. 40 provides for the deletion of the four sections which are being repealed by this section: that is, sections 474, 474A, 475 and 475A from Part 2 of the table to section 458 and the insertion of a new section, section 473A in this table. This provides for relief to be given as a tax credit against the income tax chargeable. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>While we welcome the fact that third level fees are tax deductible, nonetheless there is a huge anomaly concerning people doing part-time courses in their own time. They work during the day and are looking after themselves but they have to pay huge fees for third level courses. I was contacted recently by a lady on the modest income of £14,000 per annum and she is enrolled in a university course which involves travel of approximately 30 miles each way two nights a week. She must pay approximately £2,000 in fees. It is poor consolation to that person to get tax relief on that £2,000, as the tax relief amounts to approximately £400.</P>
      <P>That £400 would not cover her petrol costs for attending the course for a year. It is very small recognition for someone trying to improve her lot and is very discouraging. I am aware that some people who do such courses have their fees paid by their companies or, if they pass the course, the company then recoups their expenditure. However, this lady works for a body set up by the local authority and there is no recognition of her course.</P>
      <P>The 20% rate is very low and reopens an old debate about third level fees for part-time students with the Department of Education and Science but the Department of Finance is always the body which must sanction change. Given our need to encourage people back to further education and to better themselves, the Minister should reopen the debate on fees for part-time courses, particularly courses in our national universities. These are not courses in private colleges and the Minister should look at this again. Perhaps he could provide a better package to those going back to education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to Deputy McGrath's. This is a step in the right direction. <Col N="92" /> Not only are people on part-time courses funding themselves but people completing masters degrees and doctorates are also funding those courses, usually at great cost to themselves and their families. Unlike primary degrees, the fees for these courses are generally not free.</P>
      <P>One of the best things this country has done is invest in education but we need to invest in further education if we are to progress further. We ought to be more adventurous in this direction. The public sector is better than the private sector in encouraging people to improve their education levels. That is not to say the public sector provision for further education is marvellous; it is good but could be better.</P>
      <P>Apart from giving tax rebates to earners for their third level fees, will the Minister also consider introducing a system to encourage employers to facilitate and encourage their employees to take up further education? I welcome these amendments but they are only a first step in the much longer journey we need to take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section inserts a new section, section 473A, into the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to provide for the amalgamation of the existing four tax reliefs for third level education fees. Currently, the tax reliefs available on the payment of fees for education courses are somewhat complex, each with their own rules.</P>
      <P>Section 474 provides tax relief for a full-time undergraduate course in a private third level college in the State. Section 475 provides tax relief for a part-time undergraduate course in a publicly funded and approved private third level college in the State. Section 474A provides tax relief for a full-time undergraduate course in a publicly funded third level college in the EU and section 475A provides tax relief for a full and part-time postgraduate course in a publicly funded or private college in the State and in a publicly funded college in the EU. The section proposes to streamline the provisions of the four reliefs.</P>
      <P>The section, besides amalgamating reliefs, also extends the reliefs in a number of specific areas by removing the following restrictions: for repeat years, on individuals undertaking more than one course, on individuals already holding a third level qualification and on the exclusion of certain courses, that is, medical, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training. I introduced a number of these reliefs during my term as Minister for Finance and when I was a Member of the Opposition I pressed the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, to start the ball rolling. He kindly agreed. I decided this year to amalgamate all reliefs and to put them on a standard footing because the situation was becoming confusing. There were different criteria and rules for various reliefs so this provision standardises them. I have extended the reliefs to a number of areas. The exclusion of certain courses, for example, was not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath made the case on Committee Stage that the standard relief of £2,000 at 20% is only £400 and that the relief should be at the <Col N="93" /> taxpayer's marginal rate. I am not prepared to make the change at this time but these matters will probably be looked at again in years to come. When we are questioned about lowering tax rates considerably in all directions, we should look to these reliefs too. People have more money in their pockets and, as taxes are reduced, they have increased resources.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's suggestions.</P>

      <P>(f2&gt;b) Paragraph (f2&gt;a) shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Finance may by order appoint.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 30 of the Bill, as amended in the select committee. Section 30 amends section 472B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 which provides for an annual allowance of £5,000 for certain seafarers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> As it currently stands, section 30 reduces from 169 to 161 the number of days required to be at sea in a tax year to qualify for the allowance. It also provides that for the short tax year covering the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001, the number of days required to be at sea will be reduced from 161 days to 111 days while the amount of the allowance will be reduced from £5,000 to £3,700. Finally, the section converts the £5,000 into euro for the tax year 2002 and subsequent tax years.</P>
    <P>I indicated in the select committee that the reduction in the number of days required to be at sea would require European Commission approval and that, consequently, a Report Stage amendment would be moved to provide that this aspect of section 30 would be made subject to a commencement order. The amendment before the House rewrites section 30 so as to give effect to this decision.</P>

      <P>The amendment rewrites section 30 of the Bill as amended in the select committee. The rewritten section 30 first amends subsection (4) of section 472B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 to provide that for the short tax year 2001, the number of days required to be at sea to qualify for the allowance will be 125 days &ndash; 74% of 169 days &ndash; and not 169 days, while the amount of the allowance will be £3,700 and not £5,000. For the tax year 2002 and subsequent tax years, the allowance of £5,000 will be converted to 6,350.</P>
      <P>The rewritten section 30 then inserts a new subsection (4A) into section 472B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The new subsection (4A) provides, in paragraph (f2&gt;a), that, notwithstanding subsection (4) but subject to paragraph (f2&gt;b), for the short tax year 2001 the reference in subsection (4) to 125 days will be construed as a reference to 119 days, which is 74% of 161 days, and for the tax year 2002 and subsequent tax years, the reference in subsection (4) to 169 days will be construed as reference to 161 days. Under paragraph (f2&gt;b), paragraph (f2&gt;a) will come into operation by order of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The difference between the 125 and the 119 is 0.74 of 169 as against 0.74 of 161.</P>

This amendment adds the Minister for Finance, acting through the NTMA, to the list of persons who can be qualifying savings managers.

    <P>This amendment, to section 33 is being made at the request of the life assurance industry. Some of the original drafting of section 33 was based on the complex UK legislation which provides for individual savings accounts known commonly as ISAs. One of the assets which can be held in an ISA and also in a special savings incentive account is an investment in a life assurance policy. The original draft of section 33 provided that a life assurance policy could be transferred from one manager of a savings account to another. However, as the life assurance company which issues a policy to be held in a savings account will also be the savings account manager, the only way for a policy to be transferred to a new life assurance company is for the policy to be cashed and the cash transferred to the new manager. This is what this amendment provides and I commend it to the House.</P>

Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of section 848C. therefore, provides that subscriptions to these accounts must be funded by the saver or the saver's spouse from funds available to them without recourse to borrowings, or the rescheduling of existing debts.

      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage and Deputy Mitchell raised the matter that there was nothing to prevent people from rescheduling loans and making money available to invest in these saving schemes. The Minister has obviously tried to close the loophole there but how is he to police this? Is it not possible for any of us to have loans from various institutions and therefore possible to set up a schedule where our deposit from one bank can be transferred to a special savings account? Will the Minister seek an undertaking from the saver that he or she has not borrowed in order to avail of the scheme? People with children in higher education often have loans to cover their costs and may want to reschedule them to avail of the Minister's bonanza. How will the Minister ensure that he will not penalise them if they try to avail of the scheme? Will they be denied the opportunity to avail of the scheme although with their children almost educated they may have almost finished borrowing? How will this scheme work in practical terms?</P>

      <P>As I understand it the amendment is intended to clarify but in some ways it creates further questions as to what the phrase &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; actually means. The scheme is open to everybody over the age of 18 whether they have a taxable income or not. All that is required is to be resident in this country. It is possible therefore that adult children could use it. What is there to prevent parents using the names of their adult children to hold accounts? What is to prevent even siblings using each others names or opening accounts and holding money in trust for each other? It is not difficult to see that people, certainly in families, would be able to make use of multiple accounts. I cannot see how we will be in a position to police that.</P>

      <P>I want to mention a few details about protection against abuse. This query has been raised by Deputies McDowell, Mitchell, McGrath and others during the course of this debate and even when socialising last Sunday people mentioned ways of getting round the scheme to me. I am glad to know that the Irish remain ingenious and it restores my faith that the world stays the same. Though we have grown posh in recent years and we read the proper newspapers and books, when it comes to money people still think like their grandfathers and great grandfathers. Those people never existed in the Border area, but they do in other parts. This reminds me of the 14,800 people who had deposit accounts in a certain branch in Tralee. The surprising thing was that nobody seemed to know them at all. Journalists or individuals did not know them. I suspect they were real live people like brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, mothers and fathers of actual people but nobody knew them at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are some of the measures that will be taken as a protection against abuse. Every saver shall be required to make a declaration at the time of commencing an account and some five years later when the account will no longer be a special savings incentive account. It is a criminal offence for a saver to make a false declaration and I have a tentative draft of the declaration to be made. These declarations will require savers to confirm their residence status, confirm that they are the beneficial owner of the assets in the account, confirm that they have only one special savings incentive account, confirm that they will subscribe to the account with funds available to them or their spouse from their own resources without recourse to borrowings or the rescheduling of existing borrowings and confirm that the assets held in the account have not been and will not be used as security for a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Savings managers are also put under a legal obligation to ensure that assets acquired with subscriptions made to the account are acquired at <Col N="98" /> arm's length. In other words a financial institution cannot give a saver a loan in order to allow subscriptions to be made to the account. It would be very foolish for a person to try to circumvent these conditions. An account can only be opened during the one year period from 1 May next. If at any time during the following five years it is discovered that any of these conditions have not been complied with the account will be closed and the 23% tax rate which will apply to all the assets in the account will ensure withdrawal of all the benefits of the savings scheme. Furthermore the person will find himself or herself being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>What does it mean to say that a person cannot borrow money to subscribe to the new savings account? I am very anxious to read a particular word here, a new word to me, so I will read the note. This word was not dreamt up by the erudite man in my Department, somebody else is even more erudite. A word used in recent times in relation to money is the word fungible (FUNGIBLE). I am sure Deputy McDowell would know it. The dictionary definition of fungibles is that they are moveable effects which are consumed by use and which are estimated by weight, number and measure. The word comes from the Latin word <i>fungi</i> which means to perform. If I earn a weekly wage and after meeting my expenses I have a little left that I subscribe to a savings account then that subscription is met out of my own resources. If my expenses consume all my weekly wage then I have nothing left to subscribe to an account from my own resources unless I have something saved already in the bank and I use that. If I am already fairly stretched for cash and I need all my wages to live and to pay off existing loans then I cannot seek to change the terms of existing loans to free up cash to subscribe to an account. Neither can I take out a new loan to fund subscriptions to an account. This is the tentative draft of the declaration of commencement as drafted by the Revenue. It may be subject to further changes.</P>
    <P>This technical Revenue draft of the declaration of commencement may be subject to some further changes. The form will be known as an SSIA2 form and will include qualifying individual details &ndash; forename, surname, address of permanent residence, PPS number &ndash; formerly an RSI number &ndash; date of birth, special savings incentive account details; the registration number of the qualifying savings manager; the address of the qualifying funds manager in the bank; a special savings incentive account number; the amount deposited per month and the date of commencement. I previously outlined what information people will be asked to provide in the declaration.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are ingenious people in certain parts of the country &ndash; although I assure the House that people in County Kildare would not think along these lines &ndash; who may come up with ways around this. We discussed these matters on Committee Stage. Certain subsections of the Bill <Col N="99" /> stipulate that circumvention of the rules will constitute a grave offence for either the account holder or the fund manager. We took the changes in the Finance Act which arose out of the DIRT inquiry and included them in various sections of this Bill to make matters very onerous for people, particularly the qualifying fund manager. Arising from Deputy Mitchell's work with banks and financial institutions, it would be a brave institution which would consider circumventing the law in this area. That certainly will not happen to the extent it happened in the mid-1980s.</P>

      <P>I am very surprised the Minister is not aware that the Revenue Commissioners provide Latin classes. Mr. Clayton greatly amused the altar boys among us in the Committee of Public Accounts. I hear the Latin classes are also held in the Beggars' Bush Bar and I have often thought of paying it a visit.</P>
      <P>The Minister should call this new instruction &ldquo;SIM 264&rdquo; as it is totally impractical. There were only eight Revenue prosecutions in the year to June 2000. It is laughable for the Minister to say people can be prosecuted. Even in the aftermath of the DIRT inquiry, there is no culture of prosecution in the Revenue Commissioners. I do not wish to encourage people to evade taxes and break the law but we must be serious about this. Major problems will be experienced in marshalling this scheme. There is plenty of scope for people to exploit the loopholes in this provision; they would not have to be particularly adroit to do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that there are not big amounts of money involved here. I have a wife and five children and could, therefore, open seven accounts in my own name and each of their names. That would amount to a significant figure. This is an ill-considered scheme which will be open to widespread exploitation. Contrary to what the Minister says, there will not be any prosecutions. It is bad law to threaten prosecutions when they will not be made. The scheme offers a bonanza which will be welcomed by many people, including me, but that does not mean it will be good for the country. This crazy scheme entails unquantifiable costs and unquantifiable increases in savings. I have not ever seen anything as unfocused or untargeted in my life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>I asked a specific question about adult children. I think we have established that as long as the children continue to have the use of the moneys or be beneficially entitled to the moneys, it will be possible to do it in those circumstances, that is, having received the gift or receiving ongoing gifts from parents. This is a very generous scheme. I know the Minister will say it was intended to be a very generous scheme and that if there is a bit of fraying around the edges or if people make it even more generous than was originally intended, he is not worried as long as it does not get too much out of hand. It is a classic paradox. This scheme, from the point of view of the individual saver, is very generous and attractive. I would not blame anyone for participating in it. Quite the contrary, I would advise people to do so. As Deputy Mitchell points out, it is extremely difficult to calculate how much this will cost the State and the Exchequer. I wonder whether it will achieve its aims. I am not altogether sure if I support those aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> I wish to explore one detail of the scheme, the responsibility of the qualifying fund manager. I wonder to what extent he or she will be required to look behind the declaration made by the prospective saver. What will happen if a student wishes to open one of these accounts and on the face of it does not have an income. Is the bank manager obliged to ask how that person will be able to pay £200 per month to subscribe to this scheme? Is the fund manager required to carry out an investigation into the source of funds or is it reasonable for the qualifying fund manager simply to take the declaration at face value? Some managers are concerned that they will be put under an obligation to inquire into these matters. Perhaps the Minister could tell the House what obligations of inquiry are to be imposed on the fund managers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>When we look at the past history of investments and tax-viable schemes, we note the Minister said the BES scheme had a take-up of £750 million. If that amount of money was invested in this savings scheme, that is an immediate cost of £150 million per annum over the next five years. Eircom had half a million subscribers and each subscriber needed to pay an up-front payment of a substantial sum of money, probably in excess of £1,000. This scheme will entail a monthly subscription and the Minister's estimate on Committee Stage of a take-up of 100,000 subscribers will be found to be grossly underestimated. The cost to the Exchequer will be probably in excess of the Minister's forecast. He predicted a cost of £100 million. It will be interesting to see later in the year how close the Minister is to his target. I suspect the cost will be higher and it could well go out of control. We will all be encouraging people to save and reap the returns. Credit unions, An Post and the banks are all offering financial packages so that people can avail of the scheme. It is a very attractive scheme and there will be a huge take-up. I fear the scheme can be abused and even the facilitation of adult children must be questionable.</P>

      <P>I gave a tentative estimate on Committee Stage of what the costs might be if a certain number of people took up the scheme. I think it would be a very good thing. People will agree to save that amount of money for five years. It is desirable for people to get into the habit of saving. I have always been inclined to make financial schemes attractive. I do not believe in making a change and then putting <i>caveats </i> in the way of people. Schemes were introduced in the past with so many <i>caveats</i> that only one person availed of a particular scheme. This is like something in the &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; television series.

The Deputy is thinking of all the methods people will use to avail of this scheme, possibly borrow money in one place and lodge it in another. That is definitely against the law. We must make up our mind in the House, whatever about the public, as to whether we are in favour of people breaking the law or whether we will actively discourage them from doing so. We cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath makes the interesting point about what happened in the case of the Eircom and the BES schemes. I was very pleased at the good price I succeeded in obtaining for Eircom. Every March people were turning up to invest in the BES scheme because of the good returns from the tax man. Many people I know could not even remember the BES schemes in which they invested. People do not like to pay taxes and this should not be a surprise to anyone. I have never been shocked by this.</P>

      <P>As currently drafted, paragraph (f2&gt;d) of section 848C could be interpreted as meaning that on the fifth anniversary of starting a special savings incentive account, no further savings can be made through the savings manager concerned.

This amendment is to make the position clearer and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>To obtain full advantage of a special savings incentive account, savers should save over the full five year term. This legislation requires a saver to make a declaration within the 30 days of the fifth anniversary of starting the account so that only the profit from the savings is taxed and not the full value of the investment at that time. Representations have been made that the time span over which this declaration has to be made is too short. I have, therefore, extended the period during which the declaration is to be made to the period commencing 60 days before and ending 30 days after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of savings.</P>

      <P>Every person of 18 years or over is eligible to have a special savings incentive account, but only one such account. On opening an account the saver must provide to the savings manager his or unique personal public service number. To avoid unnecessary administrative difficulties which would result from a mistake being made in a person's PPS number, it is being made a requirement that the savings manager takes reasonable measures to verify the correctness of this number. How this will be done will be spelled out in guidelines and will involve the saver producing documentary evidence of his or her PPS number, for example, a tax free allowance certificate. These amendments require the savings manager to take reasonable measures to ensure compliance with all the conditions of the special savings incentive account, including verifying the correctness of PPS numbers.</P>

      <P>I am not entirely clear on the question I asked on the previous amendment we discussed, which is whether the qualifying manager is obliged or would be encouraged to inquire as to the source of the funds.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Later amendments deal with this. Qualifying managers will have to report where they believe money was obtained in suspicious circumstances. I gather it will be along the same lines as opening a bank account where the banks must comply with the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which deals with money laundering. Even children of people as well known as I am have been obliged to produce their passports or driving licences when opening bank accounts, even though they would have been known to the bank. That is because banks are afraid to take chances. One of my daughters opened a bank account when she was 18 and had to produce relevant documentation. I presume the guidelines for the savings accounts will be similar. They will set out what obligations the banks will be expected to go through with a person to verify their PPS number and to verify the source of the funds if there are any suspicious circumstances.</P>

      <P>Why is it not possible in the electronic age to cross-check an application with the computers in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether a person's PPS number, name, address and date of birth match?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be possible by the end of the year to cross-check PPS numbers against Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Revenue Commissioners records. My understanding from Committee Stage and briefings in the Department is that electronic transfer of funds will take place between the Revenue Commissioners and a financial institution on foot of information given by that institution. That institution will have a list of PPS numbers which can be cross-checked against Revenue records to ensure the numbers relate to the people the institution says they do and, most importantly, to ensure there are no multiple accounts. The main aim is to stop people having multiple accounts. After the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry, there are probably many officials in the Revenue Commissioners who would love to have the challenge of signing an order for Deputy Mitchell's arrest, which means he will have to be careful. Banks may also wish to do likewise.</P>

These people will initially commit themselves to investing certain sums of money, but they may find after 12 months that the amount is too high and want to change it. The reality may dawn on them that they have to leave the money on deposit for another four years and they may want to opt out. Are there options to pull out of the scheme during the five years?</P>

      <P>Yes. To take an extreme case, if after 12 months the investor decides to stop investing and leaves the balance for a further four years, only the interest decided by the financial institution will be added to the account each month. At the end of five years the investor will make a further declaration and withdraw the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If after the first year of saving a person's circumstances change &ndash; to which Deputy McGrath alluded, and I must tell Senator Cassidy that things are looking up for him in Westmeath &ndash; that person can stop saving but keep the account. If the person needs to draw out the money before <Col N="108" /> the five years is up, the State will take 23% of the amount was drawn out. As we discussed on Committee Stage, it is not as big a penalty as certain publications have alluded to, but there is a penalty. If a person remains in the scheme for five years, all that will be taxed is the gain on the investor's money at 23%. If the investor withdraws the money before the end of the five years, the full amount will be taxed at 23%.</P>
    <P>I gave an example of a person that ceases to invest at the end of one year after investing £200 per month. That person would have invested £2,400, plus the £600 from the Government, totalling £,3,000. If an investor like Deputy McGrath lost the election and needed money immediately &ndash; and no interest had been added to the balance for some reason &ndash; then a cost of £690 would apply, which is 23% of the £3,000. This is effectively clawing back the tax credit of £600 and £90 of the investors £2,400. That is the penalty for getting out. Have I answered all the questions?</P>

      <P>Provided the investor does not lose ordinary residence, a concept which has developed in recent years, they will be all right. Effectively, tax residence is determined by the number of days a person stays in a particular state. One is ordinarily resident in Ireland if one is not out of Ireland as a non-resident for three years. The concept of ordinary residence is more commonly used in relation to the capital gains tax code and the capital acquisitions tax code, whereas the concept of residence for income tax purposes is an easier one. If a person is ordinarily resident in Ireland he or she will be all right. Such a person will be able to open a special savings account. If he or she goes abroad after two or three years to take up another position, he or she will not be penalised.</P>

      <P>If a person who died 15 months ago had equities in a number of high flying technology companies, the market value of those assets is what it was on that day. If the value has reduced by now, that is how the market operates. The amendment only relates to underlying assets in a special savings account which are in equities. Most of the credit unions and other financial institutions will offer ordinary savings accounts, but such products are open to life insurance companies and other institutions. I have read conflicting reports on the matter and whether it would be in their interest to bring forward some equities schemes. People may be willing to purchase such products. At the end of the five years of savings, if the underlying assets are equities, their market value on that day will be used.</P>
      <P>At the end of a savings term, a person who has equities can decide to take the money and run. The applicable tax rate will be 23% and he or she will have complied with all the conditions. He or she can then head off to the Cheltenham racing festival and make a fortune on the horses or do whatever he or she wishes with the money. However, on the day the special savings account aspect ends, the individual can also decide to hold onto the equities. A value must be ascribed to the equities for the purpose of capital gains tax that might arise at some stage in the future. This is the idea behind using the market value at the time. The gains will have been taxed at 23% up to that point and the gain is then run. A person may not want to encash the equities. He or she might decide the shares are good value and that they want to stick with them by continuing to subscribe to the fund or leaving them in a financial institution. A value must be placed on them for future tax purposes.</P>

      <P>No. The person will have received a tax credit during the five years. He or she will have received a tax credit at 20% or 25%, depending on how one looks at it, as he or she put in the money. The hope is that the fund will grow for the person. However, if the value of shares in the fund falls, it is the saver's tough luck. He or she will have made the arrangement with the institution at the start and it will be up to him or her to decide whether he or she wants to take a chance on the incentive account. Another institution may offer a straightforward, demand deposit account with a guarantee of 2.5% each month, but the individual could decide to take a chance on a more high flying product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State will pay its contribution each month to a person's saving. However, the market value will be the value on the day the product finishes. A person may wish to continue saving if the value of the money he or she put in has reduced. He or she may decide that there is little point encashing <Col N="114" /> such shares and he or she might decide to hold on because they may improve tremendously over the following five years. This is a more likely situation with regard to that type of product.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
      <P>In page 105, between lines 50 and 51, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;848U.&ndash;The Minister shall direct An Post to make special savings incentive accounts available to customers and shall further direct that any administrative or other charges made by An Post in relation to the operation of such accounts shall be minimised and, if possible, eliminated.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original statement by the Minister, made in the middle of January, An Post was not included as one of the listed credit institutions. It has since been acknowledged that it is to be included, so I am not sure if it was an oversight on the Minister's part or if any other factor was <Col N="118" /> involved. It prompted me to make inquires regarding An Post.</P>
    <P>It is important that An Post should be included. This scheme is resonant of the post office certificates scheme that existed for many years and that obliged savers to put aside money for three or five years and for longer in some instances. The advantage to the State was that it had the use of the money which, from its point of view, was a very good reason for encouraging people to save. It would be a good thing if An Post was not only encouraged by the Minister, through the NTMA or otherwise, to ensure that products are made available to their customers.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that apart from market forces, there are no constraints on credit institutions in terms of the administrative charges they can make. There have been suggestions that banks or other credit institutions may impose hefty administrative charges as a means of extracting significant profits from operating these schemes on behalf of the Minister. While we cannot stop them form doing that and while I do not suggest the Minster should impose a statutory obligation on credit institutions to minimise those costs, it is possible to ensure that An Post, as a lever of the State, is well positioned in the market with at the least minimal and ideally no administrative charges so that subscribers will know exactly the benefits they can hope to secure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the amendment. It is a commercial matter for An Post and the NTMA to decide whether to offer special savings incentive accounts and under what terms. It would be inappropriate for me to intervene in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The NTMA has confirmed that it will make these savings accounts available through An Post. It is currently working on the details of the terms to be offered and will shortly put proposals to me. Therefore, no question arises for me of having to direct the provision of such accounts through An Post. It is currently the case that An Post does not levy administrative charges on the operation of accounts, nor is it proposed that such charges be introduced for the operation of new accounts. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>In a recent press release the Consumers' Association of Ireland Limited announced it will mark many of the products to be offered by the financial institutions. I am aware the institutions are not pleased at that prospect, but at least one organisation will compare like with like. This is not a State-backed scheme, although the State will make a contribution. Competition is the best way to ensure that all who participate compete at the same level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When various proposals were made regarding pensions, I was told the financial institutions <Col N="119" /> would not operate them. However, under competition they are trying to out perform one another. The same thing will happen here. When the scheme was first announced some people said that it would not be suitable for certain products because administrative charges of 2% per month would have to be charged. It was then said it would not suit the big institutions because there would have to be a fair margin between bid and offer prices. However, now that others are becoming involved providers are reducing their charges and will tighten up their margins.</P>
    <P>Approximately 40 institutions are in competition. I am glad the Consumers' Association of Ireland Limited will make comparisons. There will also probably be rows about which is the best product. Competition is the best way to resolve these matters.</P>
    <P>The NTMA through An Post will shortly put a proposition before me. I suspect it will be fairly competitive. As Deputy McDowell is aware, I am a great believer in the market regulating these things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute the substance of what the Minister has said. I am pleased to note he expects to get proposals from An Post in the near future. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that An Post is competitively positioned in the market and to ensure that the State has a direct say in this. The Minister and I are working to the same agenda here.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the current state of play with post office certificates? I understand the rate of interest payable was reduced last year and is now fairly low and unattractive. It is nothing like as attractive as this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post offers a number of products, including post office saving bank accounts, savings certificates, savings bonds, insolvent savings and prize bonds. Different rates of interest are offered on them.</P>

      <P>I will get that information for the Deputy. At least twice since I became Minister proposals have been made to me to reduce the rates of interest on offer as interest rates have reduced. The other institutions complain bitterly about the advantages they perceive An Post to hold. They see State backed schemes with different tax arrangements offering very competitive rates of interest. We have adjusted them on occasion on the recommendation of the NTMA.</P>

      <P>In page 127, line 12, to delete &ldquo;£250&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£200&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to section 45 which inserts a new section and Schedule in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to provide for an extended and simplified scheme of tax relief for donations. On Committee Stage, I agreed to reduce the minimum amount of qualifying donations from £250 to £200. This amendment carries out that promise. The minimum amount for a donation under the section is now £200. I am sure the Irish charities tax reform group will be pleased with the lowering of the limit as I, like other Deputies, received a letter from it seeking this measure. I understand the Irish charities tax reform group is seeking a mechanism to have the VAT it spends on goods and services refunded. I appreciate its position, but the VAT status of these bodies is determined by EU VAT law. Thus, apart from the very significant cost to the Exchequer of such a move, there would be considerable difficulties at EU level in making any change in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 81 is consequential and is as a result of reducing the limit for the donation. It converts the reduced limit of £200 into its euro <Col N="121" /> equivalent. I commend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 135, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;49. Section 668 of the Principal Act is amended by the substitution of the following for the definition of &lsquo;stock to which this section applies':</P>
      <P>&lsquo;&ldquo;stock to which this section applies&rdquo; means&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) all cattle forming part of the trading stock of the trade of farming, where such cattle are compulsorily disposed of on or after 6 April 1993, under any statute relating to the eradication or control of diseases in livestock, and for the purposes of this section all cattle shall be regarded as compulsorily disposed of where, in the case of any disease eradication scheme relating to the eradication or control of brucellosis in livestock, all eligible cattle for the purposes of any such scheme, together with such other cattle as are required to be disposed of, are disposed of, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) animals and poultry of a kind specified in Parts I and II, respectively, of the First Schedule to the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, forming part of the trading stock of the trade of farming, where all animals or poultry of the particular kind forming part of that trade of farming are disposed of on or after 6 December 2000, in such circumstances that compensation is <Col N="123" /> paid by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in respect of that disposal.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to amend section 668 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provides for profit deferral for tax purposes and 100% stock relief as a result of the compulsory disposal of cattle under a disease eradication scheme. I indicated on Committee Stage that I intended extending the provisions of this section to cater for the disposal of livestock as a result of the current foot and mouth scare. The amendment brings within the provisions of the section all animals and poultry specified in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. The section now provides that where a farmer disposes of any animals on or after 6 December 2000 and in respect of which compensation is paid by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the farmer is entitled to the relief provided by the section.</P>
    <P>The section provides for the deferral of profits in two equal instalments, either in the year of disposal and the following year or the two years after the year of disposal. In addition, farmers who restock their herds during the deferral period qualify for 100% stock relief instead of the usual 25% in respect of the replacement livestock. This 100% stock relief is subject to a cap equal to the amount of the profits made by farmers as a result of the compulsory disposal. Such profits are as a result of the difference between the book value of the disposed livestock at the start of the accounting period and the amount of the compensation paid under the various disease eradication schemes. The effect of both the profit deferral and the special 100% stock relief is that farmers are not taxed on what is in effect a paper profit and can restock without incurring an additional tax liability as a result of the compensation received.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 84:</P>
      <P>In page 135, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;, for the purposes of a trade carried on or to be carried on by the person,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments seek to extend the reliefs proposed to individual persons mainly in the countryside, not just to corporate or business entities. It is not unreasonable that, however isolated a house may be, it should have running water in this day and age. Tangible recognition should be given to the major efforts by group water schemes to provide water and sewerage facilities for households, not just business entities. On Committee Stage we spoke of the environmental damage caused by the proliferation of <Col N="124" /> septic tanks and the need for a national plan to replace them, as far as possible, with sewerage schemes. I do not understand the reason the section should be confined to business entities and it would be a proper step to delete the words &ldquo;for the purposes of a trade carried on or to be carried on by the person&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments seek to amend section 49. That section amends section 310 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, so as to enable major users of water services who intend to reserve capacity and are making a capital contribution towards the cost of a new water scheme to claim capital allowances on their contribution. In effect, the measure extends capital allowance for water supply in line with a similar existing provision for sewerage supply and is similar to the capital allowances available to users who install their own water service facilities.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to extend the benefits of the capital allowances which are targeted at industry to domestic users. In tabling the amendments, Deputies Mitchell and McGrath were no doubt mindful of our discussions on Committee Stage regarding group water schemes. In this regard, I remind the House of the significant Government contribution that has been made in this area. A record £420 million will be spent over the period 2000-06 on a vigorous water programme which comprises a number of targeted initiatives to improve rural water quality and protect vulnerable water sources from pollution. Money has been allocated in recent weeks by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for this purpose. Last year he announced major increases in the grants and subsidies which are designed to bring quality deficient group schemes up to a satisfactory standard and to boost the development and expansion of the group water scheme.</P>
      <P>As part of that package there are generous grants of 100% for treatment facilities while grants of up to 85% are available for individual connections to group water schemes up to a maximum cost of £6,000 per house served. In addition, the operating costs for these schemes are effectively recouped in full by the Exchequer through a subsidy of £155 per household. These grants are far more generous than the tax relief now being sought. Furthermore, I wish to remind the House that the Government has agreed a water pricing framework which includes a commitment to fully fund the costs of water and waste water services for domestic users.</P>
      <P>Consequently, for these reasons, I oppose both amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister is giving us the thumbs down in regard to the amendments. As he acknowledged on Committee Stage, there is a tremendous need to improve facilities in rural areas, including a particular need to bring water to the far reaches of the country. Many people <Col N="125" /> are operating from wells in rural areas. It is a very short-sighted view if one is to operate a well in a rural area while at the same time providing sewerage facilities. No matter how big a site is, in effect, one is digging water out of one hole in the ground while further on there is a septic tank. It is just a question of time until pollution occurs. Pollution from a septic tank into a well can be particularly dangerous and lead to jaundice, which has its own consequential effects. We, as the national parliament, should encourage people as far as possible to provide a water supply, even to remote areas. While I welcome the money allocated for group water schemes and so on, nonetheless, we are getting to the point where the provision of water in certain areas is quite expensive. I have met householders who recently received charges of £600, £700, £800, £1,000 and £1,200 for group schemes, as well as the allocations from Government, which I acknowledge are very generous. This is another incentive to get people on board. The cost should be tax deductible if people are to be encouraged to provide that much needed water supply.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will reconsider his position in regard to this matter because the amount of money involved would be relatively small. The management and control of the environment, while providing services to people, is extremely important.</P>

      <P>In page 136, line 13, after &ldquo;commenced&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and for the purposes of this section shall be deemed to be the amount expended increased by the Consumer Price Index in respect of each full year since the date the trade commenced on 21 November 1997 as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>These amendments relate to section 50 of the Bill which provides for a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of a taxi licence acquired on or before 21 November 2000, that is, the announcement date of the new taxi licence regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell and McGrath seek to increase the amount of expenditure incurred in line with the Consumer Price Index for each year <Col N="126" /> since the trade commenced. Amendment No. 87, in the name of Deputy McDowell, deems to put a value on the expenditure incurred of £40,000, where the actual expenditure incurred is lower than that. The Committee Stage debate on this section centred around whether the value of the licence, before deregulation, should be used for tax purposes rather than the actual cost of the licence, if that value was higher.</P>
    <P>When the difficulty with taxi plates arose at the end of last year, I announced that I would give capital allowances on the cost of a taxi plate. The principle is that it has to be the cost, no matter how long ago the plate was purchased. As I stated on Committee Stage, it would create an unheard of precedent in the tax code to start imputing a value regardless of the cost incurred. I am not going to establish the principle that, due to deregulation, we are going to impute a value higher than the actual purchase price of the plate. People who are in the taxi business and who are going to continue in business are in a far better position after tax under the changes I have made than they would have been under the old system. I have made some changes to the section to cater for some hardship cases which were brought to my attention. Amendments Nos. 88 and 89 give details of what I am prepared to do.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I regret I must reject these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak to amendment No. 87. There is a fundamental difference in relation to this issue which needs to be teased out. While taxi licences are one example, it is not difficult, as the Minister pointed out on Committee Stage, to think of other similar examples which could conceivably arise in future.</P>
      <P>The essential principle in my amendment is taking what the Minister is prepared to do a good deal further. I am saying that not only should one be compensated for costs incurred, but one should be compensated for the reality that something which they owned or had the use of is, by a decision of Government, worth virtually nothing. I do not think it is a good thing that taxi licences became worth so much, quite the contrary. It was a thoroughly bad thing that they became worth so much. It is a very poor commentary on the decision-making process, whether in this House or in local authorities, that the situation was allowed to arise. It simply should not have arisen in the first place. The truth is that it did arise and people came into possession of licences which were worth in reality £60,000, £70,000 or £80,000. These people made plans on foot of that, which they were entitled to do, because that value arose by virtue of the inaction of local authorities and Government in dealing with the availability of taxis and taxi plates, particularly in Dublin. My comments here mostly relate to Dublin, even though I gather they have relevance in other taxi meter areas also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that these taxi plates had a value, whether this should have been the <Col N="127" /> case is an entirely different matter. For example, people coming up to retirement age who might not have paid out a huge amount of money 20 years ago, were nonetheless entitled to think that when they retired they would be in possession of something which was worth a significant amount of money. These people were entitled to make plans on foot of that belief. That belief held true for as long as Government did not do anything. The essential point is that the licence to which a value attached was devalued or rendered valueless entirely because of an action and decision of Government. Had it chosen to, Government could have decided to change the regulations on foot of the court decision. It chose by its inaction not to do so, therefore, it chose to render the licences effectively valueless.</P>
    <P>It has been said by the Minister, and others, that people made a decision to get into the business which was contingent on market forces and which exposed them to market forces, therefore, they should sink or swim depending on the market at any given time. The truth is that the market and the value of the licence was exclusively dictated by Government, not by the market in any serious sense. Therefore, it was exclusively the decision of Government which rendered the licence plates valueless. In the circumstances, it is not unreasonable for people to be compensated.</P>
    <P>The scheme set out by the Minister to allow people to write-off the cost of acquiring the licence against tax over a five year period is reasonable. I am seeking to extend the proposal one step further by saying this should be subject to a minimum whereby they would be entitled to claim 40,000 euros or £30,000 as a minimum amount of tax relief to be written off in exactly the same way, using the scheme the Minister has set out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is not of the Minister's making. The amendments he tabled on Committee Stage, including today's amendments Nos. 88 and 89, should be acknowledged. Following the debate on Committee Stage, I thought there would have been a few more measures. I thought that the words probate tax was paid in page 136, line 16, would be omitted. This was found to be not necessary. The way I interpreted that was not correct.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy McDowell's amendment No. 87. Will the Minister reconsider accepting it? While I am not an expert on tax law, I am guided by common sense. While taxi operators may not be concerned about their livelihoods, their asset has devalued. That may not be so awful if one is a taximan driving around, but it is if one is a taxi operator who is a widower or ill. I do not want to go into the detail of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I bought a house 25 years ago for £10,000 and the State wanted to acquire it to facilitate road widening or some other works, I would not be given £10,000 but the today's value of the <Col N="128" /> house. Perhaps a different law applies to such circumstances.</P>
    <P>From a common-sense viewpoint, I support the points made by Deputy McDowell.  Irrespective of whether taxi plates should have had the value they had, the State has effectively declared those assets valueless. The livelihoods of taxi operators such as widowers of taximen who are ill, living of such assets have disappeared. The amendment tabled by Deputy McDowell goes some way towards addressing those hardship cases. If it does not meet tax law criteria, it makes common sense. This decision will be viewed as a heartless one by the Government in years to come. Perhaps every Minister has had to make decisions about which he or she did not feel happy and I appreciate this was not a decision made by the Department of Finance. Is there any way the value of such assets can be recognised to some extent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a justice issue. The Constitution enshrines property rights in a way that sometimes has gone too far for my liking. If we were to confiscate the property rights of certain classes here in the way we have confiscated the rights of taximen, there would be uproar. It would not happen. I feel strongly about this issue for a number of reasons. I am glad Deputy Noel Ahern supported the thrust of these amendments on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage. He is a member of the Fianna Fáil group, which worsened the situation for several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly dispute that, although we do not have the time to debate that here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>For several years the Fianna Fáil group resisted all proposals to gradually increase the number of taxi licences. That group incited taximen to oppose any such proposals. That is on the record of the city council. One of the problems with local authorities generally is that councillors fail to exercise the powers they have been given. Nonetheless, I welcome the support of Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
      <P>We are robbing and plundering a class of mainly men who got up of their backsides when the level of employment was not as good as it is now and rather than draw the dole borrowed or used their redundancy money to buy a taxi plate. They thought they had an asset that would cover them for the rainy day or their retirement. Many taximen are in the business ten to 13 years, going back to the bad mid-1980s and before that. They are the people who have been hard done by the Government's actions on taxis.</P>
      <P>I supported the liberalisation of taxi licences at every stage. The Fine Gael group took the initiative in the city council to increase the number of taxi licences by a reasonable number per year several years ago, but it was resisted. We lost members who were taximen for putting forward those proposals, but the position was drummed up by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The very people to whom we should be saying, &ldquo;you are the type of people we want to support, people who get up and work and do not milk the State&rdquo;, are the very people we are plundering. I am aware from the Minister's record that his attitude generally is correct and appropriate to the people who make an effort. In this case, we are confiscating the assets of a group of mainly men who do not deserve this type of treatment. They deserve the opposite. I appeal to the Minister to make some significant further concession before this Bill goes through both Houses.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support what Deputy McDowell proposes, although it is very modest. We are effectively talking about 40,000, or approximately £35,000, on a tax credit basis, which would be 20% of £35,000, £7,000. Many of these men have lost assets worth £80,000. I plead with the Minister, in the interest of justice, to consider this matter further and to do something more appropriate and proportionate to reverse an injustice we have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy McDowell's amendment dealing with taximen. Taxi operators are a much maligned group. They brought on themselves a certain amount of fire, but we must realise that, like any other major group, the majority of them are decent, honourable people. They are trying to make a living, look after their families and they are working day after day to put bread on the table.</P>
      <P>The taxi phenomenon has been a more recent event in rural areas. In my area of County Westmeath taxis have only recently come on the scene. When licences were issued even in those far flung provincial areas, they became a valuable commodity and taxi plates in my area prior to November were trading at £40,000 each. Some people bought them at that stage expecting they would have an investment for life. Many ex-servicemen invested the few pounds they had in taxi plates and set themselves up in business. With the deregulation of taxis the situation has changed. I notice some of the taxis plying in my area have a large sticker on the front of their cars stating &ldquo;full-time taxi&rdquo;. Why is that? With deregulation, other people who had money got into the market. They were able to put a car on the road and pay their insurance, but they are only part-time operators. They operate at peak time. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar with the taxi scene in his provincial area. There was not a great deal of money to be made in the taxi business, but it was a livelihood. The day time weekly runs put the bread and butter on the table, while the few pounds profit were gained by the weekend trade. With deregulation, many of those taxi operators are badly caught. The full-timers are finding it difficult to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a young couple, whom I advised to get involved in the taxi business a few years ago. They bought a plate and the business made a difference to their lives. They had been in receipt of social welfare benefit and on entering the busi<Col N="130" /> ness found they have a few pounds in their pockets. They left their council house, gave it back to the local authority, took out a mortgage and were able to manage. They were making repayments for their plate and their mortgage and were doing nicely, but now they feel they are paying for an asset, the taxi plate, that has no value. They told me they would be better off reneging on their loan and going back into a council house. They feel very demoralised and let down by what has happened. The amendment tabled by Deputy McDowell will not give them a fortune but it is a small gesture towards recognising the plight in which they are and that they have a real difficulty. We should support the amendment.</P>
    <P>I noted what Deputy Noel Ahern said today and on Committee Stage. He spoke very strongly about cases of which he was aware in the taxi business, in particular hardship cases. Perhaps the Minister will have another look at this. I know it is difficult on Report Stage and that the Minister cannot say he will go away, look at it and report to us again. He can, however, do so on the spot. He is a man who is able to make decisions and he has proved that time and again in all sorts of situations and not just on Finance Bills. He is a man who knows his mind and can make a decision. I hope he reconsiders and decides to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained this at the Select Committee. I readily recognise the angst people would feel in believing that an asset they may have valued at a certain figure is now worthless. As I tried to explain at the Select Committee, their position, as a result of the change I am making, will be far better than it would have been previously. Their after tax income, what they will have in their pocket, will be far better following the change I will make in allowing capital allowances, or wear and tear allowances, to be written off against the cost of the taxi plate.</P>
      <P>On the day of the court decision and following a lot of the hullabaloo, I, without any promoting from anybody, came forward with the idea that it would only be fair to allow wear and tear allowances against an asset people would have purchased, but that it would be strictly on the value of the cost of that asset. We would be creating an unheard of principle if we started to impute a cost on something for which people did not pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is hard to explain that to people like those about whom Deputy McGrath spoke who re-mortgaged their home and got a loan but the asset which they thought was worth £30,000 or £40,000 is not worth that. That is not the case because they will have more money each year after tax than they would have had previously. Previously, they would not have been allowed anything against the capital cost of that, say, £40,000 if they had borrowed it. They would have been allowed the interest on the £40,000 but not on the capital cost. If one does a net present value, or whatever one likes to term it, and if one <Col N="131" /> works it out, they will be better off over a period of time.</P>
    <P>I have tabled further amendments as a result of suggestions made to me on Committee Stage which will be taken later. I am not in a position to start to impute a value, as suggested by Deputy McDowell, or to apply the consumer price index to the value, as proposed in the amendment tabled by Deputies McGrath and Mitchell. I am not prepared to do either. In years to come when all this dies down, people will see the sense of what is being done now and will come to the conclusion that they worried unnecessarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being totally <Col N="132" /> inconsistent. We talked a while ago about the market value of shares under the savings scheme. We can have market values when it suits the tax man but we cannot have them when it suits the taxpayer. The Minister is not facing up to the situation faced by a person who is unable to work or who has reached the point of retirement. The value their asset had until a short time ago has disappeared. Money which they could have realised as a nest egg for their years of retirement has been confiscated as a result of the actions of the State. They are the people for whom the Minister is not doing anything. I appeal to him, in the interests of justice, to do something for them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 88:</P>
      <P>In page 137, line 20, after &ldquo;relates,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or lets the licence,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments propose changes to section 50 of the Bill which provides for a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of a taxi licence acquired on or before 21 November 2000, the announcement date of the new taxi licence regime. The announcement is effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997, when the licence was purchased prior to that date. The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. The section provides that the write-off will be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if additionally the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, in order to address some hardship cases that had been brought to my attention, I extended the section to provide that where a licence was inherited from a deceased spouse who earned on a taxi trade, the licence holder may offset the capital expenditure incurred on the original acquisition of the licence against the rental income alone from the licence, even if there is no trading income from the licence. This measure will only be available in respect of one licence. Also, in cases where inheritance tax or probate tax was paid in respect of a taxi licence, the value used for such tax purposes may be used instead of the actual capital expenditure cost, if that value is higher.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, discussion on this section centred around whether the value of the licence before deregulation should be used for such tax purposes in place of the actual cost of the licence, if that value is higher. It is an underlying principle in the tax code that relief by way of capital allowances is only given in respect of expenditure actually incurred. There is no other situation where tax allowances are given in respect of notional expenditure incurred or on the estimated market value of an asset.</P>
      <P>The principle underlying wear and tear allowances in plant and machinery is that the asset wears out over time and depreciates to nil and wear and tear allowances are given in recognition of this. In introducing an amendment which allowed value to be substituted for cost in cases where probate tax or inheritance tax was paid in respect of a licence, I was trying to cater for a particular hardship case which was brought to my attention where £1,400 was paid in probate tax in respect of a taxi plate which formed part of the estate of a deceased taxi driver who had died intestate leaving a widow and children. For probate tax the licence was valued at £70,000 and 2% tax was paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage debate I undertook to look at the issue again in relation to extending the provision to cater for the situation where a value was included for inheritance or probate tax even though no tax was paid. As I recall, there was some confusion on this point during the debate. Having reflected on this, I am not prepared to extend the &ldquo;market value&rdquo; concession in circumstances where no probate tax was paid in relation to the licence. To do so would be to stray <Col N="135" /> too far from the underlying principle I enunciated already.</P>
    <P>The section provides for a big tax break. Those in the taxi business are going to be in a far better position under the changes I have made than they would have been under the old system and I am not prepared to extend this provision any further. However, l am prepared to extend the provisions of the section to cater for the situation where a widow or widower, who has inherited the licence from his or her spouse, lets the licence to a third party who provides the associated vehicle. While the usual situation is that both the vehicle to which the licence relates and the licence itself are both rented out by the licence holder, it has been pointed out to me that there are these hardship cases where the licence is rented out by a widow, in particular, to a third party who in turn provides the vehicle.</P>
    <P>I commend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said makes no sense in principle and he knows it does not. Even if one accepts that, albeit in exceptional circumstances, a value can be imputed or attributed simply by virtue of the fact that it appears on a tax form and has therefore derived some sort of official value over the years, then accepting that principle in this particular limited circumstance means it is incumbent on the Minister to accept it in all circumstances, which he is singularly refusing to do.</P>

If attributing value is not extended across the board will the Minister end up being sued because he is allowing a value in one case and not another? Is he opening a loophole?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality of the dispute at this point is that not much separates the two sides. The Labour Court has found that the teachers have a sustainable case in relation to their pay claim. The scope of the benchmarking body, thanks largely to the ASTI, has been greatly widened. It is important that further clarification be provided for teachers on the potential of this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government expects the ASTI to consider this route as a mechanism for pursuing its pay claim, it must also make a gesture of goodwill to the ASTI to encourage it to engage in this process. There are many possibilities for such a gesture. A down payment is one. The issues of supervision and substitution could be addressed, which could provide another possibility, or there could <Col N="137" /> be some type of up front payment which would allow for lost time to be made up. Any one of these options is possible and none would interfere with the PPF. Any one of them would provide a tangible result on which the ASTI could ballot its members.</P>
    <P>What is needed now is creative thinking and an earnest effort on both sides to find a solution. Time is of the essence, however, and we are now at the eleventh hour. There is a brief opportunity to salvage the examinations but it will pass in a matter of days. A Government initiative must be taken to unlock this dispute. The examination students demand and deserve such an initiative and the welfare of the education system requires it. The ball is firmly in the Government's court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major dispute and I was surprised by the confrontational tone and provocative language from the Minister for Education and Science last night. The conclusion that quiescent social partners and the Government holding firm will bring the ASTI teachers to heel is wrong. The refusal of the Labour Court, although acknowledging that the ASTI claim has merit, to make any down payment and the subsequent attempt to demonise the teachers is calculated only to make this dispute more intractable.</P>
      <P>The pretence that the examinations will go ahead and that the papers will be marked is transparent nonsense. I say that as a Member whose daughter hopes to sit the leaving certificate examination this year. I do not believe it is possible to mark the leaving certificate examination without the participation of serving teachers. The fact that the Minister claims it is possible to do so only fills me with the conviction that it cannot be done.</P>
      <P>There is nothing about the Minister's handling of this dispute to date that would lead one to have confidence in his ability to resolve it. On a number of occasions he has exacerbated the dispute by his direct actions, such as the illegal deductions of pay and the confused, messy and frequently incorrect repayments. Flying to Malaysia and waiting for the teachers to come to heel will not resolve this dispute.</P>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the Labour Court from summoning the parties to clarify what it means by affirming that the teachers' claim has merit. A down payment against the eventual assessment of claim would require the ASTI to put the Labour Court recommendation to ballot. This would not create a precedent. There are several precedents for the Labour Court summoning the parties after issuing a major recommendation and providing clarification of the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A down payment, in circumstances where the court has acknowledged there will ultimately be a substantial payment, would not constitute a breach of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Such an initiative would tie the ASTI to balloting its members to call off its industrial action and to facilitate the conduct and marking of the <Col N="138" /> examinations. If such an up front, part payment of whatever will be the ultimate settlement is guaranteed from a current date, it would be unacceptable for the ASTI not to hold a ballot.</P>
    <P>Teachers fear that by summer 2002 the state of the economy might have changed, especially if the American economic downturn continues. There is a lack of clarity, notwithstanding the renegotiation of the PPF, about the precise date of implementation of pay increases arising from the benchmarking process. Teachers feel, therefore, that they must strike now while the iron is hot in terms of current and recent economic growth rates and Government surpluses. Instead of looking to the Far East for inspiration, the Minister, Deputy Woods, should indicate his willingness to respond to such an invitation from the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Court feels unable to take such an initiative, it is open to the Labour Relations Commission to do so without further delay, especially since the referral to the Labour Court in the first instance was on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis given the customary bargaining machinery used by teachers. The Minister's inaction lacks imagination in facilitating a resolution of this dispute. That is inexcusable given the stress being caused to examination students and their parents and in view of the career implications for leaving certificate students.</P>
    <P>The strategy of the Government to grind the ASTI into the ground will not resolve this dispute. The Government is creating a siege mentality among teachers and that will not provide a way out. There is a well trodden path whereby the Labour Court can resummon the parties and use the recommendation it issued as a basis for settlement along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuation of the stand-off between the Government and the ASTI has reached a critical point. As each day passes, the consequences for examination students get worse and the integrity of our education system weakens.</P>
      <P>My serious concern is for disadvantaged students. Students who are disadvantaged because of either their abilities or income run a high risk of leaving school early. The disadvantaged students in the class of 2001 should be commended for persisting within the education system until their final year. However, the number of days lost to date as a result of the deadlock in this dispute will have negative repercussions for them. Lost days are damaging for students who need extra help to achieve results. For students from disadvantaged areas, lack of funds to attend grind classes and lack of access to computers have damaged their chances of achieving the results to which they aspire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned using the Internet. In many places in my constituency the Internet is a mystery. Disadvantaged areas tend to lack important resources such as well resourced libraries. There are three computers in Athy library <Col N="139" /> and they must be booked a week in advance. What hope have school classes in Athy of using that facility to access the material on the Internet which the Minister claims is available to help them prepare for their examinations? This further militates against disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>Students who get disappointing results are less likely to repeat the leaving certificate in an attempt to achieve satisfactory results. They are more likely to enter the labour market to take up unskilled, low paid and insecure jobs. I hope the fears I express do not become a reality. I hope the Government can act responsibly, show leadership and sort out this dispute.</P>
    <P>Instead of engaging in trench warfare, the Taoiseach should take his role as leader of the Government seriously. His duty must be to ensure students are not damaged, particularly students who are disadvantaged. In addition, he has a duty to ensure that the education system is not damaged beyond repair. It is vital that teaching should be an attractive career path for young graduates. The salary is part of a job's attractiveness and, given the choice in employment opportunities for young graduates, there is no doubt that many will opt for well paid opportunities in the high tech sector instead. The continuation of the stand-off between the Government and the ASTI does no favours for anyone. Both sides must now act responsibly. Time is of the essence and another week cannot be allowed to go by without a resolution.</P>
    <P>My other concerns go beyond the forthcoming examinations. I have deep fears about the long-term repercussions of this dispute on our education system. If the situation is allowed to persist new problems will emerge concerning secondary school places. Parents and students are already developing a reluctance to attend ASTI schools on the basis that if the Government allows the deadlock to continue schools will face an autumn of discontent. Unless this dispute is resolved parents will be forced to choose TUI schools above ASTI schools for children starting secondary school in September. This could have major consequences and I ask the Minister to set a procedure in place immediately to resolve this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for sharing time with me. I will focus on the hardship and damage being caused to students and parents as a result of the current stand-off between the Government and the ASTI. In what could only be described as a bitter and inflammatory speech last night the Minister for Education and Science attempted to lay the entire blame for the current crisis on the ASTI. The tone was in keeping with the provocative noises the Minister and the Taoiseach have made since autumn. It is a self defeating strategy which will only serve to alienate the teachers from the industrial relations framework and make a resolution of this dispute harder to find. The current <Col N="140" /> dispute will have to be resolved and that resolution will involve both sides, ASTI and Government, moving from their entrenched positions.</P>
      <P>A vital component to settling this dispute is that if the Minister is actively seeking a resolution he will have the good sense and the courage to make the first move. Given the tone and content of last night's speech I fear the Minister has no such intention. If this stance continues then the deadlock in the dispute will remain and it is the thousands of students around the country and their parents who will pay the price. It is an appalling situation and will have long-term consequences. It demands an urgent initiative from the Government and a courageous response from the ASTI to break the current deadlock.</P>
      <P>The pressure on students at this time is indefensible. Over recent years the stress in regard to the leaving certificate has become incredible. To have the exams thrown into doubt at this stage is outrageous. It is unfair to the students as they prepare for probably the most important examination of their academic lives. That it is the students with special needs who may be the first to be seriously disrupted highlights the tragedy of the situation. It is vital for these students that both sides in this dispute use every waking hour to break the deadlock as soon as possible. As long as the current crisis continues the pressure and disruption suffered by students and their parents escalates. This evening there are signs that the ASTI will seek clarification of the recent Labour Court recommendation. I welcome the development and would encourage both the Minister and the ASTI to grasp the window of opportunity that now exists to save the leaving and junior certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>Parents, students and everyone with an interest in the education system demand a resolution to the teachers strike. This is no time to engage in a blame game as the Minister attempted to do last night. It is a time for all parties to use the short time available to hammer out a settlement that will give the students the certainty they need to face their examinations with confidence despite the disruptions they have had these past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank Deputy Shortall for sharing her time. The one thing we can be sure about in this dispute is that like all industrial disputes in the public service it will be settled. There has not ever been a dispute in the public service that did not end up being settled through negotiation between the trade unions involved and the Government. This one will be settled and the question is whether it will be settled in time to allow students sit their examinations and in time to allow them prepare adequately for them. Another question is whether it will be done before irreparable damage is done both to the teaching profession and to the education system. The only way the dispute can be resolved now without damage being inflicted on students, the teaching profession and the education system is <Col N="141" /> for the Government to take an initiative and engage in direct discussions with the ASTI to find a formula to settle the dispute. Both sides in the dispute seem to be using the examinations as the ultimate weapon. The ASTI has targeted them and it has been described as the nuclear option. Similarly the Minister's insistence that he can go ahead with the examinations is being used, by him and the Government, as a weapon to defeat the ASTI.</P>
      <P>The examinations cannot go ahead. Where will the Minister get people to mark the scripts? It is nonsense to suggest that somebody who got a degree in English 20 years ago, and last read a novel two years ago, can walk in and correct honours leaving certificate English. It ignores the fact that those who mark examinations build up considerable experience. The teacher who goes in to mark examinations starts on the pass junior certificate and builds up a number of years experience. The teacher who gets to mark an honours leaving certificate script is a teacher with a considerable number of years experience in correcting and examining. Even if the Minister managed to get people to mark them where will he get the supervising examiners. They have been correcting papers for years and are the critical people in the examination system who standardise the results and provide consistency in them. Where will he find the chief examiners to do that? These are the critical people. The Minister cannot do it and there is no point in giving the impression publicly that he can.</P>
      <P>The impression has also been created that anyone can go into an examination hall and keep order. That is nonsense. There are decisions which require professional judgment to be made. Are two answer papers to be given to a child? Are two children to be allowed out to the toilet at the same time even if one is manifestly sick? What happens if there is a different version of the question on the Irish and English versions of the paper? What happens if there is a typographical error? Decisions requiring professional judgment will have to be made in the examination hall and these can only be made by teachers. The Minister needs to get into discussion with the ASTI and settle this before irreparable damage is done to children, the teaching profession and the education system. If he cannot do it then he should get off the stage and let someone else do it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Labour Party Members for sharing their time. The stress and strain on leaving and junior certificate pupils is mounting daily as a result of the teachers' dispute. This is an extremely worrying time for pupils and parents. We must also recognise the tremendous strain this dispute is causing to teachers who invest so much of their energy and commitment in preparing their classes for vital examinations. For teachers the current action is unprecedented. They want this dispute resolved so they can give their full attention once again to their classes. The Government through both the <Col N="142" /> Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, have consistently refused to get directly involved in this dispute. Their bottom line is that pay claims must be processed through the PPF and benchmarking. This should not be a precondition to talks. This Government's attitude is both wrong and disastrous. It needs to have a hands-on approach and cannot allow the PPF to be an apartheid type agreement where any group outside it is regarded as beyond the pale. The Government must show flexibility and it is in their gift to do so. The Taoiseach is deservedly recognised for his negotiating skills and should personally intervene in the dispute. Direct talks should take place between the ASTI and the Government. Both sides must do all in their power to bring that about and every avenue must be explored. The ASTI must display flexibility to facilitate talks and mobilise maximum support for their cause.</P>
      <P>In recent days and weeks, and even in the past 24 hours in this House, much of the commentary has attempted to place the entire responsibility for this dispute and its resolution on the teachers. I believe the Government bears the primary responsibility for allowing this dispute to develop and efforts should now be directed towards the Government moving into direct negotiations with teachers. I appeal to the Minister to take the first courageous step here this evening. Our children and young students, first and foremost, look to him for leadership and I urge him to provide it.

      <P>The Members of this House and the people of Ireland are well aware that this debate relates to a pay dispute between the ASTI and the Government and the action which should be taken by the two parties at this time. It is important, then, that we examine the actions to date of the parties to the dispute. When agreement could not be reached on the ASTI's 30% pay claim through direct negotiation, the matter was referred to the independent Teachers Arbitration Board which found that ASTI members should be treated in the same way as other teachers who accepted the terms of the PPF. The ASTI rejected that finding and commenced its campaign of industrial action. The Government accepted the recommendations of the independent board and implemented its findings&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte was not interrupted during his contribution and he will not deflect me from what I want to say.</P>
      <P>The Government accepted the board's recommendations and implemented its findings by applying the terms of the PPF to ASTI members. This had the effect of ensuring that ASTI members' salaries were maintained on a par with their teacher colleagues in the other unions. At the outset of the industrial action last November, the ASTI complained that the PPF increases were inadequate because of the higher than anticipated rate of inflation at that time, that the benchmarking process was unclear and that payment of any increases arising from benchmarking was too far into the future. Members will be well aware that benchmarking was agreed on 4 December and incorporated in the budget by the Minister for Finance on 5 December. Any position adopted by any body or group prior to that was irrelevant.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed in December to improve payments under the PPF by providing for an additional payment of 2% from 1 April next and a lump sum payment of 1% of annual salary on 1 April 2002. In addition, it agreed that 25% of any increase accruing from benchmarking would be paid with effect from 1 December this year with the implementation of the remainder of the increase to be a matter for discussion between the relevant parties.</P>

      <P>During the period of the industrial action, the ASTI continuously called for the appointment of another independent body to examine its case as it claimed the arbitration board had not considered it fully. In an effort to resolve this dispute and in the interests of the nation's children, the Government agreed to refer the dispute to the Labour Court. When the Labour Court issued its recommendation on 9 March, the Government accepted it while the ASTI totally rejected it and immediately embarked on industrial action, including non-co-operation with all work connected with the annual State examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> It is clear that it is the Government which modified its position at every stage of this dispute in order to achieve an equitable resolution. In spite of this and the definitive statement from the Labour Court that the teachers had a sustainable case in regard to their claim that they had fallen behind other comparable graduate employment groups, the ASTI still decided to disregard the considered recommendation of the most experienced industrial relations body in the land.</P>
    <P>The ASTI has ignored the improvements in the direct pay terms of the PPF and the arrangements in regard to bringing forward the payment of the increases, arising from benchmarking, agreed by the Government and the other public service unions since the dispute commenced. The ASTI does not accept the assurances of the Government and the Labour Court that the benchmarking process does not involve the introduction of performance related pay. It is inexplicable that the union steadfastly refuses to submit its pay claim to the benchmarking body to be adjudicated on at the same time and on the basis as all other public service unions, including the other teachers' unions. It is time the ASTI acknowledged that the PPF and the associated early settlers' agreement provides an increase of almost 22% and that benchmarking can deliver more. The ASTI must realise that it cannot be treated exceptionally or in a different manner to any other public service or teacher colleague group.</P>
    <P>Social partnership, which has delivered our current prosperity, must be maintained. I urge the ASTI to rejoin the fold and utilise the mechanisms of the PPF to process its claim to finality in an orderly fashion through the long-standing and tested industrial relations machinery of the State.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Rabbitte, I, too, have had the privilege of serving on boards of management. Deputy Ulick Burke and I served on a board of management together and I chaired a number of boards. While I do not have any parchments or teaching qualifications, I am proud to be a Member of this House as a result of the contribution of primary and secondary school teachers.

The Government has not sought conflict; it has taken every possible action to bring about a resolution to this issue. The examinations will proceed because the children of this country cannot be denied the right to sit such examinations this year. Nobody wants conflict. I do not believe the vast majority of teachers want such conflict and I appeal to them at this eleventh hour, prior to tomorrow's central executive meeting, to suspend their industrial action. I urge them to participate in the normal work they do on an annual basis and to take an objective view of the benchmarking process. That is what parents want and it is what 80% of teachers want. This issue can be resolved if some leadership is provided and if common sense prevails. The teachers need only take one small step forward to create an opportunity for the resolution of this conflict in the interests of Irish students.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that very difficult debate when the common basic scale was being put in place which, in some respects, is being echoed by the sentiments currently being expressed by members of the teaching profession. Most people who went into a career in teaching did so because they felt it was a vocation. At the risk of being accused of being sentimental or schmaltzy, teachers in Ireland have for generations past delivered an education system of which we can justly be proud. We are now at a difficult crossroads. Above all, it is time for cool and calm heads and a sensible approach. Members of this House participated in the attempts of the Joint Committee on Education and Science to examine the recommendations of the Labour Court to see if we could help in some way. We have all had a chance to make a contribution but inflammatory remarks inside or outside this house are not helpful. There is a window of opportunity and I was pleased to hear the measured response of the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Quinn, today. It does not seem to have gone unnoticed. I call on the ASTI to do what everybody in this country wants it to do, to take the opportunity to reflect on the advice given to it and to look at how it might address its present difficulties. These may be of its own making, but we should assist it to <Col N="146" /> find a way out. The Joint Managerial Body has said it would be helpful if the ASTI would stand down from the three day industrial action next week, move towards supporting the oral, aural and practical examinations, and not inhibit the arrangements for special needs students. It was not ever the intention to disrupt those arrangements and the general secretary has been very helpful but measures like that are not helpful to the resolution of this dispute.</P>
    <P>The Government has been extremely helpful to the ASTI. It has participated in the conciliation and arbitration process, and has gone to a mediator and the Labour Court. The PPF has been paid to ASTI members as well as to everyone else.</P>
    <P>The ASTI needs to look at the pressures it is putting on students and I know many members are individually aware of that. The ASTI does not seem to realise the pressures on students because of the uncertainty of its actions. I was pleased to learn that the strategy the Minister has devised to provide supervision for the examinations is showing results. As of today, approximately 5,000 applications for the posts of superintendents have been received by the Department. That is an important signal to the ASTI that there are people who are prepared to work in the examination system.</P>
    <P>The ASTI should understand that the examination system should be separated from the rest of the dispute. Participation in the examination system is not part of teachers' contracts and has developed through practice over the years. The parents' representative bodies have made a very great contribution but I ask that they be patient and understand the positions of both the ASTI and the Government.</P>
    <P>There is great hope in the Labour Court recommendation that a teaching forum be set up. There are many issues which now need to be examined. As the Taoiseach said today, the system has developed in a piecemeal fashion over the years. The religious made a huge contribution to the system but are no longer available in such numbers. The issue of supervision needs to be addressed. The profession has become a part-time profession at certain levels. The forum could look at all these issues.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking has been rejected by the ASTI and that is a pity. It has been said there is no guarantee that benchmarking will produce a result acceptable to the teaching unions or to the public service unions. It has arisen from the refined wisdom of the pay partnership and the pay determination system. The process is chaired by an independent judge without any strings attached, and without reference to performance-related pay. The ASTI needs to examine benchmarking as a way forward.</P>
    <P>I wonder what members of ASTI have to fear from benchmarking given that the Labour Court has said the ASTI has a strong case. Their colleagues in the INTO and the TUI have accepted the benchmarking process. Members of ASTI are <Col N="147" /> prepared to compare themselves with other graduate employments in their arguments for a 30% pay increase but they are prepared to reject the process which would achieve this. They will not accept the outcome of two separate independent and experienced industrial relations fora both of which arrived at similar conclusions. The increases already awarded and due to be awarded under the PPF together with a commitment to pay a quarter of any increase from the benchmarking exercise constitute a reasonable response to the ASTI claim.</P>
    <P>I ask the ASTI to heed the call from both pupils and parents to suspend industrial action and reflect on the damage being done to the future prospects of so many young people. I also ask the ASTI leadership to consider its strategy and the effect that strategy is having on students preparing for examinations. Those students cannot afford to have further disruption of the already limited number of school days available to them between now and the examinations. I call on the central executive committee of the union to reconsider its stance on the benchmarking process and put the recommendation of the Labour Court to a full ballot of the members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must first declare that I am a former member of the teaching profession in case there is any talk of conflict of interest. In the course of the debate in this House on the industrial action being taken by the ASTI, an effort was made in some of the contributions from the other side of the House to supplant fact with fiction. The essential thrust of Deputy Creed's contribution centred around his sense of dissatisfaction with what he termed a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach by the Government. I hope Deputy Creed enjoyed whatever time he spent on another planet in recent months. It is time for him to return to the real world and face some of the harsh realities. It is important to point out that the Government has participated in the conciliation and arbitration system for the ASTI claim. Unfortunately, the ASTI rejected the arbitration findings. The Government subsequently applied the general pay terms of the PPF and the 3% early settlers increase to the ASTI and agreed that the Labour Court would further examine the ASTI claim. The Labour Court then held that the application of the PPF to the ASTI members met all of their claim in full other than their demand for comparison with other graduate employments. The claim that ASTI members had fallen behind other comparable graduate employment groups was upheld by the Labour Court and it recommended that that aspect of the claim should be processed through the public service benchmarking body. The Government has applied the general pay terms of the PPF and the 3% early settlers increase to the ASTI, giving a total increase of about 22%. The Labour Court has found that it has a sustainable case under the <Col N="148" /> benchmarking process, but the message does not appear to have got through to ASTI members.</P>
      <P>The response of their trade union has been disappointing. Its central executive council rejected the Labour Court recommendations out of hand and has embarked on an escalated programme of industrial action without reference to a ballot of its members causing unwarranted difficulty&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>When he speaks, the Deputy can tell me when the ballot was taken. The ASTI has embarked on an escalated programme of industrial action without reference to a ballot of its members causing unwarranted difficulty and anxiety for examination students and their parents.</P>
      <P>How Deputy Creed and his party can portray this as a Government agenda to smash the ASTI and humiliate its membership into submission defies belief. He seems to be saying that the Government, after bona fide participation, should discard the well established and respected industrial relations machinery of the State because some elements within the ASTI do not agree with its findings. With that type of attitude, it is just as well Fine Gael is not in government because the country would be on its knees as a result of moral cowardice. Deputy Coveney accused the Taoiseach of refusing to talk to the ASTI unless negotiations began exclusively on the Government's terms. Either the Deputy has not read the Taoiseach's letter to the ASTI, has misread it, does not understand it or chooses to misrepresent it. Whatever the reason, he is wrong in his statement.</P>
      <P>Many of the contributions have focused on the major contribution the teaching profession has made to the country. I am sure no Member would argue to the contrary and, having served in that noble profession, I, certainly, would not argue with it. No one on the Government side of the House underestimates the extent to which our growth and development into a relatively prosperous nation have been built on the dedication and commitment of those in the teaching profession generally. That applies to all teachers, including those represented by the INTO and the TUI. Those two trade unions are content to deal with their cases for increased pay under the benchmarking system. The ASTI should do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former teacher and ASTI member and someone who retains a keen interest in educational issues, I am dismayed by the approach the ASTI leadership has adopted on this issue from the outset and have conveyed that view to former colleagues. By not subscribing to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness it has succeeded in isolating itself from the trade union movement and fellow teachers and teaching unions, breaking in the process a joint approach adopted by teaching unions which has worked <Col N="149" /> very well. As a teacher, I was involved in some of the previous joint efforts by teachers to improve their pay and conditions in education. The ASTI has also put itself in a position where it is at loggerheads with parents, which is unprecedented in the history of the modern education system, and, most visibly and regrettably, pupils.</P>
    <P>I regret that a group which is not representative of the vast majority of members of the secondary teaching profession has led the ASTI down this cul de sac.</P>

      <P>In the process it has damaged not just the ASTI, but the wider profession and the education system in general. That element within the ASTI which drives this so-called crusade is increasingly losing touch with reality. As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said, the vast majority of the ordinary ASTI membership do not regard the future of 120,000 junior and leaving certificate students as fair game in advancing their cause, unless the teaching profession has changed utterly in the past ten to 12 years.</P>
      <P>It is noticeable that, when the nursing profession went on strike, it was careful to ensure emergency cover was provided. It is striking to witness the different approach adopted by the element within the ASTI which seems to regard its most vulnerable charges as nothing more than a nuclear button to be pressed in advancing its campaign. It is not representative of the teaching profession or the vast majority of secondary teachers. It is time for the majority within the ASTI to make their voices heard. They must ensure realism replaces the unreasonable approach adopted by some in the leadership. It is time the ASTI's energy was directed to where it can achieve lasting benefits for all its members, which is advancing their case for improved pay under the benchmarking process.</P>
      <P>I am a former teacher and career guidance counsellor and I am well aware of the type of pressure the 120,000 young men and women are under at this time of year in normal circumstances just thinking about the examinations, never mind having to contend with the additional pressures of a teachers' strike. The Government has clearly stated that, come next June, those 120,000 students will sit their examinations and not be 120,000 pawns filling the front line in a battle plan drawn up by an unrepresentative element within the ASTI.</P>

I am confident that the public will continue this support for the Government in ensuring the rights of young people are not denied and the examinations are conducted, papers marked, results issued and children allowed to progess upon their chosen career paths. For the Government to do or Members to support anything else would be nothing short of a reckless abdication of our responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I ask the moderate members of the ASTI to regain control of the trade union before it does any more damage to itself, the teaching profession and the education system. They, like those in their fellow teaching unions, should pursue their claim for comparable pay under the benchmarking process. The Labour Court has indicated this as the way forward and, the sooner the responsible elements in the ASTI respond positively to this, the sooner we can address the issues involved. The Government has clearly accepted that issues need to be addressed which, probably, should have been long ago. This is the opportunity to have those issues addressed and the ASTI should address them immediately. As a former member, I believe that if the ASTI leadership continues on its current path it will result in serious rifts and division within the union. A divided union is not in anyone's interest, least of all teachers. I make a special plea to ASTI members. I have met union members from my own constituency over the past two months. Some are bewildered by what is happening. Some are not well informed on what the leadership is doing and it is time for ordinary union members to regain control.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Dukes, Kenny, Sargent and Joe Higgins. I support the motion tabled by my colleague Deputy Creed in the name of the Fine Gael party. I did not expect an attack against a professional group such as that delivered by the Minister for Education and Science in the House last night. <Col N="151" /> We can forget having a Minister who depends on partnership and goodwill to deliver the services for which he has responsibility. This Minister has kicked partnership in the teeth by his use of intemperate language with regard to ASTI tactics, using words such as &ldquo;to continue callously to pursue its demands&rdquo;; &ldquo;the ruthless intent of the ASTI&rdquo;; &ldquo;the bullying tactics of the ASTI&rdquo;; &ldquo;the reckless pursuit of their claim&rdquo;; &ldquo;mischievous undermining of student's minds&rdquo;; and &ldquo;cynically targeted students&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has once more gone too far. He started this process of antagonism at the outset of the industrial action in autumn 2000, when he alienated the ASTI by illegally deducting pay for days of &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo;.</P>

Dismissal is the Minister's solution to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Education is now in crisis. The long-term damage caused by the Minister's inaction and his statements cannot be fully quantified, but it will haunt this Government. If, through the Minister's uncaring attitude, the teachers who deliver the service are undermined and demoralised then the future of education at second level is bleak in the extreme. The Minister is now pursuing the same tactics used in Thatcherite England. That is, to face the teachers down at all costs. The consequences of this attitude are manifest to all who care to see the results in England. It may be too late for the Minister to prevent this decline and change his attitude, but his successor will have to re-establish the partnership now destroyed by him.</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept some of the responsibility for a situation where parent's spokespersons have called teachers on strike &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;; where teachers' authority is undermined by walkouts; and the extreme and sad situation where teachers have had eggs thrown at them and are spat upon by students. Does the Minister condone this activity? Will he reject it? He has failed to do so to date as he is too busy with his spin doctors, feeding elements of the media with selective anti-teacher propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a difficult time for students preparing for exams in this uncertain climate. The Minister cannot ignore the concern and anguish of the dedicated teachers who have taught these students for the past six years. They are not terrorists and they want to see students advance into the world beyond the school in full preparedness with the highest certification. The Minister should not <Col N="152" /> continue to protract this distress. He should act now before student confidence is undermined.</P>
    <P>The Minister declared that the resolution of this dispute remains a top priority and that it is his sincere hope that a resolution can be found. Who can believe this statement? What has the Minister done to bring about a resolution? The students do not believe the Minister&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has caused great distress to teachers and students alike. The Minister has to ensure that the exams will uphold the highest standards of quality and integrity in our education system. Nothing that the Minister has done to date, including his so-called contingency plans, can convince me that this can be done or that he has the ability to do it. He must eliminate the doubt from the minds of students and parents that the capacity and logistics are in place to undertake this task. The Minister cannot do that and he knows it. Will he explain to the House <Col N="153" /> how he will operate his plans given that, in ordinary circumstances, it takes three weeks for the examinations and the marking of scripts to be undertaken?

      <P>&mdash;a wonderful city that has the misfortune to be misrepresented by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.</P>
      <P>Three groups of people are being damaged by this dispute. The first and most important group is the certificate students, particularly the leaving certificate students. We should not forget that however difficult this will be for leaving certificate students this year who wish to go on to third level education, the consequences could be even greater for leaving and junior certificate students who will not get any other qualifications. Such students enter the workforce with only the certificate they get from schools. Not many people mention such students, but they must be remembered.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that the examinations will be held this year. I would prefer much more clarity from the Ministers on the measures they are taking. From what I see and hear, I am not convinced the examinations can be held. However, even if they go ahead, many leaving certificate students now find that they are behind for two reasons. The first is that they have missed days because teachers have been on a work-to-rule while the second is that, as a direct consequence, a number of them have not even finished all the course work that should have been done. Such students have been placed under enormous strain since last November and it gets worse as every day passes.</P>
      <P>The second group being damaged by the dispute is the secondary school teachers. Many members of the public, parents and students do not understand why the dispute has gone on for so long, why the ASTI appears unable to find a way of resolving it and why the ASTI has, in their eyes, targeted the certificate students this year. There is a serious risk of confrontation between students and teachers. If that happens, it will adversely affect teachers' authority not only now, but in the years ahead. It will affect the respect in which they are held by students and parents for a long time and this will be extremely bad for the profession. It will be a bad blow to it and the conditions in which teachers carry out their duties.</P>
      <P>The third group being damaged is the Government. That does not particularly worry me as far as the personalities are concerned, but I worry about the damage the dispute is doing to the process of government. The Government has given no indication that it is trying to communicate with teachers or trying to get across any pattern of activity&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not try to hide behind hedges. I cannot understand why the ASTI has failed to grasp or comprehend the clear signals in the Labour Court report that there are factors in the current situation that could provide a way into negotiations for secondary school teachers. From my contacts with trade union sources &ndash; I am not the only one with such contacts &ndash; I am satisfied that there is a strong disposition on the part of people deeply involved in the PPF towards finding ways of defining and using the type of leeway identified by the Labour Court to resolve this problem in a way that does not prejudice the PPF or the partnership process.</P>
      <P>I have the clear impression that the Government understands the signals given by the Labour Court in its report. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the Government is prepared to exert itself in any way to communicate the meaning of those signals to the ASTI. All the Government's actions so far have been confrontational. All the Ministers have done is close every door in sight instead of trying to open them.</P>
      <P>It is not fanciful to remind the Government that it has a precedent for the way the dispute should be handled. It had the support of the House for its approach to the peace process when it made it clear that it would not impose preconditions at any sensitive stage of the negotiations. It is time the Government applied that lesson to this dispute. Both sides must learn that and it is time for them both to step back from their entrenched positions and find ways of getting together rather than staying apart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in this complex strike has evolved to the point where the ingredients are now available and identified which, if properly mixed and presented, could either lead to a radical restructuring of the education system or to it being severely damaged for years to come. When the Minister, Deputy Woods, walked forward in Áras an Uachtaráin to accept his seal of office, he did so as the political protector and developer of the education system in all its forms. To date, he has not shown in his Ministry the necessary interest, enthusiasm or imagination to <Col N="156" /> lead the educational sector into the future and enable it to continue to be the engine of the tiger economy, as he described it some time ago.</P>
      <P>Political culpability for this strike rests on the shoulders of the Minister for Education and Science. He must ensure that the legal rights of children to a proper education are implemented and that the legal responsibility he holds for running State examinations and having them marked properly is met. The Secretary General of his Department, in a most honest and forthright admission to the Joint Committee on Education and Science, said some time ago that he wanted the teachers involved and that it is practically impossible to mark the examinations without their experience and assistance.</P>
      <P>This not a time for riding high horses or trying to engage in face saving exercises. It is a time for real leadership and facing the reality that is frightening for many young people. There are a number of irrefutable facts. Some 120,000 students and their parents feel stressed, pressured and let down. Their educational study rhythm has been severely disrupted since last September, adding to the pressure. When the nurses provided emergency care during their strike, in most cases they did so in respect of patients they did not know and had never met. When gardaí provided an emergency service, they did so for the community in general. However, in this case, the strike days have destroyed the unique and special relationship that is required between student and teacher. All the years of encouragement and advice and the development of community leadership and personal development skills are set at nought. Pupils feel let down in their hour of need. This has brought about a watershed in the volunteerism concept in education.</P>
      <P>The Minister should explain what is meant by benchmarking and, more importantly, what it is not. There is paranoia among the teaching profession about what it might entail. He should also clarify how a legitimate trade union can pursue its legitimate pay claim outside the PPF, of which it is not mandatory to be part.</P>
      <P>The Government acts as employer of the teachers and should invite them to talks. That is not a concession, but good diplomacy and politics. The Minister should clarify what it is the Government wants and assist the teachers in having the Labour Court clarify its recommendations. It should explain what is meant by the establishment of a teaching forum, for which I called last October. It should set a time limit of 18 months for the forum to do its work with a request that a report be issued by the end of this year. The forum has the potential to make the teaching profession one of which everybody can be proud.</P>
      <P>The Minister stands at the crossroads. He can either be the Donogh O'Malley of the new millennium or the person who will destroy Irish education. The choice is his.</P>

      <P>Very few Governments have had to deal with an ASTI strike. The last one commenced on 1 February 1969 and the only one before that was in 1920. Matters have to be very bad before teachers take strike action. Bad as matters were at the outset of the dispute, by its studied indifference the Government has made them worse. The refusal to pay teachers unless they engaged in the supervision of playgrounds was a cul-de-sac from which the Minister had to do a U-turn. He is now in another cul-de-sac.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at the Labour Court recommendation and distinguish between a PPF award and a clear stand alone down payment. I also appeal to him to ask the Labour Court to review its recommendation and consider acknowledging in a tangible way its admission that secondary school teachers are unpaid and recommend a down payment as the first step towards a final settlement. This would allow examination preparations to proceed without stoppages and distractions. Already this week oral examinations have been deferred. Last year they were in jeopardy because teachers could not be found to leave their classrooms to assume the additional responsibilities of examiners.</P>
      <P>Even before the dispute the warning bells of a crisis in education faced the Minister. Still he tells us all is well and examinations will proceed. Leaving and junior certificate examination candidates in Dublin North and around the country want to know when they will be held. They also want to know what is in place to ensure written examinations can proceed. I could not tell them. I hope the Minister can in detail.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he has no evidence of teacher shortages, even before the dispute. The facts are otherwise and speak for themselves. In the school year 2000-01, 69% of schools experienced teacher shortages. Dublin reported 84% shortages; County Leitrim, 100%; County Meath, 87%; County Limerick, 71%, and County Galway, 62%. County Kerry reported a figure 40%, the best in the country, but even there almost half of the county's schools had shortages. If the Minister was the owner of a crèche, given his neglect of education, he would now be in court and, possibly, behind bars.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Following on his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, slíbhín like, heaped on teachers the same disgusting slanders which the hated Margaret Thatcher heaped on miners in Great Britain in the 1980s when she attempted to crush the trade union movement. Using all the methods of McCarthyite witch hunting he was only short of labelling ASTI members, the country's educators, the enemy within. It is a shameful day for the Government, which is criminally sacrificing the future of education in its determination to hammer down the hatches on other workers, especially low paid workers in the Civil Service <Col N="158" /> who are seeking a just wage in this period of economic growth.</P>
      <P>The concerted media campaign of vilification of teachers, which has reached a crescendo in recent days, is disgusting in the extreme. There have been a few notable exceptions. As well as the usual hacks, in recent days certain<i> prima donnas</i> in journalism, who consider themselves to be the paragons of liberality, have travelled a well worn path of taking the side of the Establishment when the chips are down.</P>
      <P>The Government's strike breaking plans for the examinations will be disastrous. The Minister may go to every highway and byway of the State and press gang every lame dog and stray cat into the examination halls to attempt to supervise the examinations. That in itself will unsettle the students. It is inconceivable that the examinations can be corrected without the teachers. Let us end the fiction the Minister has been attempting to sustain in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>I defend the democratic right of secondary school students to strike and protest outside Leinster House or anywhere else. However, with his media spaniels at his heel, the Minister believed he could use the thousands of students in the country as a battering ram against the teachers. Happily, many of them have protested against the Minister and the failure of the Government to deal justly with their teachers. They have not swallowed the propaganda and I urge them not to do so.</P>
      <P>Benchmarking is the great buzzword and another smokescreen for the Government. It began as a means to sweat more labour out of Japanese factory workers. Why should we use the discredited means of multinational companies for the education system?</P>

      <P>It is with deep regret that I must speak on this historic, but very sad moment in the history of Irish education. The Minister was out of the country last weekend while the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was busy at a typewriter producing material that could be considered as incitement to hatred in a normal democracy. The students have a right to an education while the Government must deal with the wage problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a bigger responsibility, to govern. In this it has failed miserably. The Taoiseach and the Minister may refer to the PPF, an important factor. The Government has failed, however, to deal with the interests of citizens and the students who face their examinations. Four months ago, in response to my question in the House, the Minister said that he could guarantee an equal chance to all students doing their exam<Col N="159" /> inations this year. Today he knows that is not the case. It is an unequal playing pitch. In addition, students whose classes were not interrupted have no guarantee that they will sit their oral examinations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has created a very sad situation. In any normal democracy the Government would do the honourable thing and say that it is unable to rule and resign. Students walked out of classes yesterday and protested outside Leinster House today. If that is the tiger Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are riding, it is time it was tied up. It is also time both parties resigned from Government because they are a disgrace and failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1969 I was on strike as a member of the ASTI. I was finer looking then. This strike and the manner in which the Minister and the Government have handled it remind me of the manner in which it handled the nurses' industrial dispute earlier in its term of office. It appears as if it will have similar consequences.</P>
      <P>The Government decided that it would not treat with the nurses. It has the notion that when dealing with teachers or nurses the best industrial relations strategy is to allow them to strike.</P>
      <P>The theory is that as nurses and teachers do not usually resort to the strike weapon and are not represented by militant unions, and because in the opinion of the Government they are professions with a very high percentage of women, when they go on the picket line and feel the cold breeze of public disapproval, as well as the cold weather, their resistance will break and the strike will be settled on the Government's terms. That is the strategy of the hard nosed employer represented by the Minister for Education and Science, and it was the strategy adopted by his colleague who is now the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in regard to the nurses. In terms of hard nosed industrial relations strategy it worked in the case of the nurses. They settled, according to the Government's spin doctors, on its terms. The PPF was secure, according to the Government, and everyone went on to a greater and more prosperous Celtic economy.</P>
      <P>However, a few weeks later, the nurses who were forced into a settlement looked around for alternative jobs. They walked out of the wards. In Beaumont Hospital and the Mater there is a 25% turnover of nurses every year. Nurses are trying to do everything except engage in nursing. The way in which the Government won its pyrrhic victory over the nurses devastated the health services. The reason the Government is pouring billions of pounds into the health services without getting any result is founded in what happened in the nurses' industrial dispute and the fact that they are no longer willing to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is facing a similar position with the teachers. It has used its power and adopted a hard nosed industrial relations attitude. It has been provocative and manipulated the <Col N="160" /> media to put the ASTI into a position where it rarely receives a favourable line in a newspaper. The Government probably has the capacity to drive forward and run some kind of examinations in the summer though I do not believe it has the capacity to correct them. If it does so, it will achieve another pyrrhic victory over another public service union but it will live to regret it because the teachers will walk out of the classrooms led by the younger teachers, the EPT teachers, who are part-time anyway, temporary teachers and those with skills, maths and science, that can be used in the modern economy. It is extremely difficult to get a physics teacher. Younger teachers with a good arts degree will retrain for the IT industry, go into journalism or public relations. We will have the kind of teaching profession, with the dire educational consequences, that is now commonplace in the cities of the United Kingdom. That is what the Government faces. It is a risky strategy.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that as well as being the employer of the teachers he has a duty, in the national interest, as Deputy Belton said, to govern the country in everyone's interest, principally that of the 120,000 students who are now at risk because of his cavalier attitude to this dispute. It is not a question of this dispute being handled badly but of a Minister and his advisers deciding to handle it in a provocative way to provoke the teachers into action. For example, why would the Minister make alternative plans for examinations last December when there was no threat to them at that time? Why did he make these announcements?</P>

      <P>Finally, the court in considering this case has been conscious of the emotions aroused by the effects of this dispute on a wide range of people and the national consequences of failure to resolve the dispute.

      <P>That is the kind of language the Minister used and it is provocative. The Labour Court recommendation is a basis for settlement. <Col N="162" /> Many of us have been involved in industrial relations on both sides of the table. I know the Taoiseach has significant expertise in this area. We all know that when the Labour Court adjudicates it is conscious of its independence as a forum of industrial relations. It will not reconvene if it is doomed to failure a second time.</P>
      <P>Demands for Labour Court clarification are usually demands to adjust or modify the position. Everyone knows what is meant. When somebody looks for clarification it is code for saying if someone can tweak this a bit and modify that we may get a settlement. There are no circumstances I know of in which it is successful if one side calls for clarification. The Labour Court simply will not respond. It does not want to be rebuffed. The way to do it, and the Minister's boss knows this as there is no better man when it comes to these matters, is for the Government to commence a process which will bring the ASTI into bilateral talks so that it can work out an agreed modification of the Labour Court position that can be put to it when it is asked for clarification. When it gives its clarification, it will be on the basis of what the employer and union has agreed beforehand. That is the way industrial relations works and that is how it will work in this case. It is time for the Minister to begin that process.</P>
      <P>The real victims are the 120,000 students, those doing the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations. That they marched on the Dáil is significant. While they have a democratic right to do so, it is a great pity for society that our children would be radicalised and believe they have to march on the national parliament to get their democratic rights. It is the responsibility of Government to protect the rights of children and one of those rights is to sit the examinations.</P>
      <P>Members should ask themselves a simple question, that is, what do they believe the students, teachers and all of us want? We want the examinations to go ahead in a credible way so that this group of students will be able to sit their examinations this year in harmonious circumstances and be confident their papers are properly marked. No one is taking sides on that issue. It is the responsibility of the Minister and the Government to arrange the negotiation process which delivers that result. All the other bits and pieces will fall into place. There are at least five favourable recommendations in favour of the ASTI which can be built up to give them the kind of settlement they are seeking. However, the Minister must negotiate. He must end the insults, confrontation and conflict. He should get into a bilateral situation and get the modifications on Finbarr Flood's document so that the examinations can go ahead and peace can be restored in the schools. Apart from 1920 and 1969, the ASTI has a good record in industrial relations. Some 32 years later, they are at the point of striking again.</P>

      <P>In page 138, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;51.&ndash;(1) Section 284(3A) of the Principal Act is amended&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) by the substitution in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of &lsquo;6 years' for &lsquo;3 years',</P>

    <P>&lsquo;(<i>ba</i>) Notwithstanding subsection (2), but subject to subsection (4), wear and tear allowances to be made to any person in respect of machinery or plant to which this subsection applies, and in respect of which capital expenditure is incurred on or after the date of the coming into operation of <i>section 51</i> of the <i>Finance Act</i>,<i> 2001</i>, shall be made during a writing-down period of 6 years beginning with the first chargeable period or its basis period at the end of which the machinery or plant belongs to that person and is in use for the purposes of that person's trade, and shall be of an amount equal to&ndash;</P>

    <P>(ii) as respects the next 5 years of the writing-down period, 20 per cent of the balance of that actual cost after the deduction of any allowance made by virtue of subparagraph (i).',</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) by the insertion in paragraph (<i>c</i>) of &lsquo;or in subparagraph (i) or (ii), as may be appropriate, of paragraph (<i>ba</i>),' after &lsquo;paragraph (<i>b</i>),'.</P>
    <P>(2) Section 403(5A) of the Principal Act is amended by the substitution in paragraph (<i>b</i>)(ii) of &lsquo;6 years' for &lsquo;3 years'.</P>
    <P>(3) This section shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Finance may by order appoint.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to insert a new section 51 in the Bill. The new section amends section 284(3A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provides an enhanced regime of capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure incurred on certain sea fishing boats in the white fish fleet. The regime involves granting capital allowances over an eight year period. An allowance equal to 50% of qualifying expenditure is available in year one with the balance of the expenditure written off for tax purposes at the rate of 15% a year in years two to seven and a rate of 10% in year eight. This regime applies only in respect of capital expenditure incurred in the period of three years commencing on 4 September 1998. In other words, the scheme is due to expire on 3 September 2001.</P>
    <P>I propose in the new section 51 to provide for a three year extension of the scheme to 3 September 2004. Furthermore, I intend that the enhanced capital allowance regime that will apply will involve a six year writing-down period. A <Col N="169" /> 50% allowance will be available in year one. For each of the remaining five years the balance of the qualifying expenditure will be written off for tax purposes at a rate of 20%.</P>
    <P>The new section will extend the current exemption for corporate lessors of qualifying fishing boats for a further three years. Normally capital allowances in respect of leased plant and machinery may only be set off against leasing income. Section 403(5A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, proves an exemption from this rule for corporate lessors of qualifying fishing boats. Where expenditure is incurred within the three years ending on 3 September 2001 the capital allowances claimed by corporate lessors in respect of such boats can be set against other income, that is, the allowances are not confined to a set off against leasing income. The new section provides for a three year extension of this exemption to 3 September 2004.</P>
    <P>In line with the introduction of the original scheme for the white fish fleet the new section 51 will come into operation by way of a commencement order, following approval of the enhanced scheme by the EU Commission. Once approval has been secured, I will make the necessary commencement order for section 51. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment and know that this has been a very successful scheme in the past two to three years. Its continuation is clearly warranted.</P>
      <P>This afternoon the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources stated that he would shortly announce details of a new scheme which I understood would be something of the variety described in the Bill. Is this what he is talking about or is there a further new scheme up the Minister's sleeve about which we should know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is the only tax scheme proposed. I am sorry, there is the whitefish and national development programmes. The Government's whitefish renewal programme was launched in 1998 and is supporting an investment of £70 million in the sector. To date support has been provided for the introduction of 29 new fishing vessels and 12 modern second-hand vessels. Over 5,000 lifesaving devices have been provided for skippers and crews of almost 600 vessels. A further 299 vessels have been authorised under the Operational Programme for Fisheries, 1994-99, which includes the whitefish renewal programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know the number who availed of the tax break I am now extending. Representations were made to me to extend it beyond 3 <Col N="170" /> September 2001, including representations from the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and others. I decided to extend it as I intend it to allow further development to take place in this area.</P>
    <P>What is unfortunate is that EU approval must be secured again, but that will be applied for by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. If one can be sure of anything to do with the European Commission, it does not anticipate major difficulties. We have to wait and see, however, because it is only an extension of an existing scheme for which we received approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat the point I made on Committee Stage. We have to work out a means by which we can work out if these capital allowances and schemes are working. I am aware that in this case we can tell if a number of ships have come on stream in the last three or four years and it is likely that that can be attributed to the scheme. There has to be a method, however, by which Revenue and policy makers can assess the success of schemes. I urge the Minister and Revenue to develop such a means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>At least two, if not three, Finance Bills ago I promised the House that the review of the success of the seaside resorts scheme was being undertaken by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. We have made some tentative estimates in my Department, with the help of the Revenue Commissioners, of the amount of tax loss forgone. In a written answer to a parliamentary question I estimated the amount of tax forgone, thereby implying the amount of investment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell. It would be far better if we had some mechanism whereby we could readily assess this. Regarding the capital allowance breaks, they are only assessed from individuals' tax returns, usually self-employed returns, and it is a matter of putting all the information together. We do not have a mechanism which can indicate at any one point what taxpayer is applying for what. I am not sure if it would ever be possible to devolve a scheme which would give such instantaneous results. My Department and the Revenue Commissioners will apply our brains to the matter to determine what we can do, but it is not for lack of trying by the Revenue; it is just that it is difficult to assess all the figures at any one time. It would be far more satisfactory if we had the figures available.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister assess tax forgone? It is illusory. If one says: &ldquo;If we charged that at 20% instead of 10%, we would have got twice the amount, whereas if we charged twice the amount, we would not have got it?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point regarding changes in taxation such as the change in the tax rate from 44% to 42% or the change in capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. I remember on the <Col N="171" /> day of the first budget regarding capital gains tax that I included a figure of £19 million for the possibility of a tax loss; it is in the budgetary figures. I covered myself by saying that it was in the interests of prudence and that I was advised to do so by my officials, though I did not believe it would be that particular figure.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right in relation to assessing the figure, but it is easy to assess when it comes to capital allowances and breaks such as mortgage interest. One extrapolates from the figures. One works out what the person's tax rate was and one has the tax break. If we looked at Deputy Mitchell's tax return, we would be able to assess the value of interest relief to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>But there will be increased activity as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the figure is easy to work out in areas like that. In areas such as capital allowances, the tax forgone would be the capital allowance breaks at the person's rate of tax. When one mentions increased activity to do with a reduction in taxation such as capital gains tax or otherwise, it is a little airy-fairy. I share the Deputy's views in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is, probably, greater activity, but it is traditional to assess it in this way. I am not sure if I am right to describe this as a static basis, but it should be easy enough to assess tax forgone in cases such as capital allowances for the whitefish programme, hotels, seaside resort schemes, mortgage interest and the VHI. It is different in other areas. Sometimes we use figures and I wonder if it is really tax forgone at all. We would be able to work out what the actual tax forgone is because it is a matter of a simple calculation. If the person did not receive the tax break, they would not be paying that amount of tax.</P>
      <P>Many of these breaks are given to investors. The Deputy's point is that as it is treated in other areas of activity, we should calculate it there also. I accept that is a legitimate viewpoint.</P>

      <P>In page 139, line 11, to delete &ldquo;20&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;0&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We raised this matter on Committee Stage when we sought not so much to eliminate DIRT as to zero rate it. That means one at least would keep the mechanics in place in order that one would have the option of increasing it should interest <Col N="172" /> rates move in a particular way. This would be a more tangible savings mechanism than that proposed by the Minister and a more tangible cost. It is ridiculous that we are taxing interest on savings when the rate of inflation is higher than the savings return; effectively we are discouraging savings by taxing negative income. This allows us, however, to raise international developments on the interest rate front in recent days and speculation on what may happen in the euro zone. There is zero rating of interest rates in Japan and a proposed reduction of 0.5% in the United States. Would the Minister care to speculate on what the trend will be for interest rates for the rest of this year, not necessarily in the immediate future? That has a bearing on the amendments because if interest rates go lower than inflation, it adds to the argument for the elimination of DIRT, at least on a temporary basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding my speculations on future interest rate trends, I do not speculate either about future interest rate trends or on the value of the currency. That is a long-held principle of mine and was developed when I was in Opposition and long before I became a spokesperson on finance. The best advice I could give Ministers for Finance throughout the globe, prospective Ministers for Finance or anybody else is to keep their mouths shut about what they think of currencies and everything else. That is what the markets love. I had the opportunity to practice this as Minister for Finance for a considerable period before we joined the euro and fixed the central point of our rate.</P>
      <P>I do not speculate about interest rates. However, I note with interest what has happened in Japan and the United States. In another aside yesterday, to prove the point I have always made that economics is not an exact science, I alluded to the fact that while Deputy Mitchell and I agree that savings are a good thing, particularly in the Irish economy, Japan is trying to encourage people away from saving. For a long time Japan has tried to encourage its people to spend money but the Japanese steadfastly refuse to do so.</P>
      <P>A classmate of mine who now lives in Japan told me two and a half years ago that the largest sales in Japan were in money boxes. People were actually taking money out of the Japanese equivalent of the credit union and storing it. Despite the best efforts of the Japanese Government to stimulate the economy, it has failed and now the interest rate is zero. I note, however, from today's teletext that there was a jump in the Nikkei index in the past 24 hours. A Minister for Finance would be wise not to speculate on what will happen either to currencies or interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 91 and 92 relate to section 53 of the Bill while amendment No. 94 relates to section 55. The technical effect of these amendments would be to reduce the rate of DIRT on deposit interest to nil in relation to existing special savings accounts and the new special term accounts, as provided for in section 55. I under<Col N="173" /> stand from our discussions in the select committee that the Deputies' intention is that DIRT should be zero rated for all savings.</P>
    <P>Apart from the loss of revenue which would result from acceptance of this proposal, it is difficult to justify this amendment as it favours savings by way of deposit accounts. There are many personal savings vehicles, other than deposit accounts, into which taxpayers put their savings, for example, unit trusts, life assurance policies and equities. While I recognise and accept the intention behind these amendments, I have already decided to go a different route. My proposals in relation to special savings incentive accounts give significant incentives in relation to savings, particularly to those on low to medium incomes. These accounts also provide significant flexibility as savings may be made by way of deposit accounts, equities, Government securities, unit trusts and life policies.</P>
    <P>I note from the Fine Gael proposals prior to the budget that it was that party's intention to exempt the first £5,000 of savings from DIRT to assist those on fixed incomes on the basis that their savings were being eroded. Under section 55 of the Bill, I have provided that interest on medium and long-term deposits will be exempt on the first £375 and £500 respectively of deposit interest received. These exemptions have the effect of exempting deposit interest on up to twice the amount of savings which was originally proposed by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>While I accept the intention behind the proposals, I regret I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell pointed out earlier that people who have savings invested in various places at present are getting low rates of interest and are then paying DIRT on that interest. Many of them resent that. The DIRT yield is decreasing; it is down to approximately £130 million at present and continues to fall.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, in the case of existing savings, the Minister is taking 20% in DIRT from the interest received by people who have savings in deposit accounts. At the same time he is encouraging people to invest in savings and is giving them a 25% return on savings of up to £200 per month. Does the Minister not see a contradiction in that? By taxing the interest on savings the Minister is discouraging people from saving but, on the other hand, he is encouraging people to open other accounts and collect money from the Revenue by virtue of so doing. Over the five year period people could shift their savings from the accounts in which they are currently gaining a small amount of interest, from which the Minister is getting a small return of 20%, into these savings accounts. That will cost the Revenue money. Does the Minister see the contradiction between the two approaches and, on that basis, can he not see the logic of what we propose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interest rates are low and inflation is rising. Last week the inflation rate increased again; it is <Col N="174" /> now at 5.3% for this year despite the Minister's forecast. I was interested to hear him say he does not make forecasts but he did forecast in the budget&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister forecast that inflation would be 4.5% for this year but the rate increased last month from a projected 5.2% to 5.3%. However, interest rates are so low that people are losing money by leaving it on deposit and subjecting it to this terrible DIRT.</P>
      <P>I remember canvassing a certain cleric's house in 1986 when DIRT had been reintroduced. I got a huge berating at the door. He really resented the DIRT, how it was working and the effect it would have. In fact, I do not believe he voted for us anyway. He continued to vote as he always had. At the time, however, he lashed out at the tax and that reaction has not changed. DIRT is resented. Perhaps the Minister would look at this again and see the contradiction that exists between the savings scheme and the DIRT.</P>

      <P>Over the years the Minister has persuaded me to agree with his view in relation to commenting on interest rates and speculating about the currency. I previously held the view that these were legitimate matters of public discussion where there should be a good degree of accountability. However, having seen what happened to the unfortunate Oscar Lafontaine and Wim Duisenberg and the over shooting of the markets following what appeared to be tame comments, I have come to the same view as the Minister that the least said, the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this issue extensively on Committee Stage. Deputy McGrath's and Deputy Mitchell's objective is to encourage people to save. Whatever the effect of my scheme will be &ndash; there might be an element of switching <Col N="175" />&ndash; it does provide an incentive for new savings. The abolition of DIRT on existing savings is a pure dead weight cost. People who have saved those amounts of money will keep the money in those financial institutions and the abolition of DIRT would not encourage them to save extra. Deputy Mitchell might contend that the abolition of DIRT might encourage more people to save but I believe that would be marginal. The scheme I put forward is far more attractive in encouraging people to save. There will be no DIRT levied in the period of the five years; it will be levied at the end.</P>
      <P>DIRT has come in for much criticism in recent years and there has been great debate about it as a result of the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry. The tax was not introduced by me but by Deputy Dukes. However, I liked the concept of DIRT even then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister never said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, strange as that might appear. The change that was made subsequently to make it a final liability was an extremely far thinking step. Prior to the introduction of DIRT, there were massive numbers of people evading tax. Nobody was returning it, a bit like the credit unions. We will not mention the nice people in the credit unions. Deputy Mitchell will notice how reformed I am since he became spokesperson. Very few people returned it and it led to all kinds of confusion. There used to be a central register in the Revenue and the banks would send in anyone with more than £70. Then in one unfortunate budget around 1982 it was reduced on budget night to £50 thereby preventing people from whipping their money out and reducing it below £500. The interest was always about £52 on these little £500 accounts and they got returned to the Revenue Commissioners. Then everybody started getting letters asking for their RSI number and that led to all kind of difficulties.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Dukes did as Minister was to introduce a system where tax was deducted at source and the Exchequer got more money. Then when the change was made to make it a final liability it was even better as people did not have to return it at all. It was a far better way for collecting the money. The DIRT now gives less benefit to the Exchequer than it did in earlier years but it was an efficient way of changing the system. I do not go along with the proposals of Deputies McGrath and Mitchell for reducing the DIRT to zero. My savings incentive scheme is more attractive.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to section 54 which relates to special portfolio investment accounts. Special portfolio investment accounts were introduced in the Finance Act, 1993 along with other savings products with the objective of keeping money in the country in the light of capital liberalisation. All of these products, at that time, had a favourable 10 per cent tax rate. This product involves investment in a basket of equities managed by a stockbroker with a focus on investment in Irish equities. As there is now no tax advantage attached to these products, I have decided to allow no new ones to be taken out and to remove some of the conditions attaching to existing products, as they are no longer necessary. This amendment does three things: first it provides that no new special portfolio investment accounts can be opened after 5 April next; second that the targeting of investment in Irish equities be removed; and finally that the condition that the value of individuals' investments be reduced to £75,000 every five years has been removed. I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;(3) This section shall not apply to a building or structure which is in use as a holiday cottage and comprised in premises first registered on or after 6 April 2001 in a register of approved holiday cottages established by Bord Fáilte Éireann under Part III of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, where, prior to such premises becoming so registered&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the building or structure was a qualifying premises within the meaning of section 353, by virtue of being in use for the purposes of the operation of a tourist accommodation facility specified in a list published under section 9 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the provisions of section 355(4) did not apply to expenditure incurred on the acquisition, construction or refurbishment of that building or structure, by virtue of the provisions of section 355(5).'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 60 of the Bill which amends section 405 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which restricts the offset of capital allowances for holiday cottages against non-rental income. The amendment will amend section 405 in order that its provisions will not apply to certain registered holiday cottages, qualifying under the seaside resort scheme, currently listed under section 9 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957. I have received a representation in the past <Col N="180" /> two years from operators of self-catering holiday cottage schemes in certain resort areas to whom I spoke on this issue last July on the occasion of opening the Pebble Beach holiday complex in Tramore. They expressed concern at the additional cost involved in listing holiday cottages as opposed to registering them with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for relief under the seaside resort scheme, owners of self-catering cottages must either register their cottages in a register of approved holiday cottages established by Bord Fáilte under Part III of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, or have them included in a list published under section 9 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957. I have looked at this issue in the past two years and was surprised at the extra costs involved in having self-catering cottages listed in comparison with the cost involved with registering. In the case of cottages registered under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, the initial registration fee is £115.50 while the annual renewal fee is only £22. On the other hand, the initial fee for having a cottage listed under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957, is £220 and the annual renewal fee is £135 per unit. Some owners of holiday cottages in group schemes in the 15 resort areas are not in a position to use the less expensive option of having their cottages registered with Bord Fáilte without such a course of action adversely affecting their entitlements to having the capital allowances under the seaside resort scheme offset against their income from all sources. I have decided, therefore, to respond to the concerns of the tourism sector expressed to me regarding this issue by allowing owners of schemes of self-catering cottages in the 15 designated resorts the flexibility and degree of choice as to how they wish to promote and advertise their accommodation. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    <P>This amendment proposes to amend section 61 of the Bill which provides for relief for refurbished rented residential accommodation. The section provides for 100% capital allowances over seven years against rental income in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the refurbishment of rented residential property. The amendment <Col N="181" /> amends the conditions for a house becoming a qualifying premises for the purposes of the section. It clarifies that if a house does not satisfy certain housing standards as set down by the various housing regulations, it cannot qualify for the relief. It does this by linking the current paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) together into one paragraph (<i>a</i>) with two subparagraphs (i) and (ii). The current paragraph (<i>c</i>), which is now renumbered paragraph (<i>b</i>), is separate and not connected to paragraphs (<i>a</i>)(i) and (ii). I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 99 and 100 are to section 64 of the Bill. These amendments, with other amendments, to which we will come later, address the taxation of life assurance policies in order that, in so far as possible, there is a consistent regime for both domestic and foreign polices. It should be remembered that, nowadays, life assurance products are often just another form of investment, not just a contract which pays out on death. The amendments to section 64 ensure, where payment is made under a foreign life policy, on death or disability, the investment return from a policy is taxed, but not the amount payable in respect of the actual risk of death or disability. This is what is being provided for in respect of domestic policies. The amendments also ensure foreign life policies taken out prior to the introduction of a tax on such policies, in 1993, will from now on be liable to tax. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 101, 102 and 103 are to section 65 of the Bill which provides for a new taxation regime for foreign life polices issued from other European Union member states, the members states of the EEA and OECD countries with which we have a double taxation treaty. This new regime provides that where a holder of such a policy makes full disclosure of any profits to Revenue, they will be eligible to be taxed at the same rate as applies to a domestic policy, namely, 23%. If they do not make full disclosure and are found out by audit or otherwise, they will be liable to a 40% tax rate. The amendments also introduce some technical refinements to this regime to mirror changes being made to the domestic life policy taxation regime for payments made on the occasion of the death or disability of the policy holder. On the occasion of death or disability, it is only the investment profit which will be taxed, not the payments made in respect of the risk assured against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the taxable profits from these foreign policies are made subject to income tax, it is provided that losses arising from a different source of the policy holder cannot be set off against such profits. This levels the playing field with domestic life companies which operate an exit tax on payment to policy holders. It is provided that the income from a foreign life policy charged to income tax will not be subject to the health levy and that tax paid on payment from a policy on death can be set off against any capital acquisition <Col N="184" /> tax arising from the same event.

    <P>This amendment is to section 66 of the Bill which relates to special investment policies. Special investment policies are a class of life assurance policy introduced in Finance Act, 1993, with other savings products, and have a focus on investment in Irish equities. They were introduced with the objective of keeping money in the country in the light of capital liberalisation. All these products, at that time, had a favourable 10% tax rate. As there is now no tax advantage attached to this product, I provided in last year's Finance Act that no new investment could be made in them from 1 January last. The amendment provides for two further changes. First, the investment focus on Irish equities has been removed and, second, the condition that the value of the individual's investment be reduced to £75,000 every five years has also been removed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take amendments Nos. 105, 110 and 111 together, all of which relate to the taxation on death of a policy holder of a domestic life assurance policy. Amendments Nos. 105 and 110 provide for how payments on death or disability are to be taxed. Life assurance policies are often another method of investment with a monetary payment for death or disability included in the contract. What these two amendments provide for is that only the investment return will be subject to tax, not the payment in respect of the risk of death or disability which the life company assures. Amendment No. 111 ensures that where tax applies to a payment on death, such tax can <Col N="186" /> be set off against any capital acquisition tax arising on the same event.</P>
    <P>I wish to indicate two drafting errors that appear on page 199 of the Bill which I request the Clerk to correct under the directions of the Ceann Comhairle pursuant to Standing Order 126. The first is in line 7 where the reference to section 730G1 should be to section 730G7. The second is in line 11 where the reference to section 730H should be to section 730GA and the reference to section 730I inserted by amendment No. 111 should be a reference to section 730GB.

      <P>I note that amendments Nos. 106 and 109 are in my name and that of Deputy McDowell. All these amendments are to section 68 of the Bill which relates to the taxation regime for domestic life assurance policies. The amendments tidy up the drafting of section 68 and are all to section 730C(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provides that the assignment of a life assurance policy will not trigger a tax charge in certain situations.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 106 removes the requirement that a husband and wife who assign a policy must be living together to avoid a tax charge. As the assurance industry has rightly indicated, how would it know? In any case, such a requirement is not necessary in this context. Amendments Nos. 107 and 108 acknowledge that a couple who are divorced are no longer spouses, but rather former spouses. Amendment No. 109 corrects a drafting error to ensure the same relief from a tax charge applies on the assignment of a life policy between spouses or former spouses following either a foreign or an Irish judicial separation. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

These are unit trusts, of which all the unit holders are tax exempt persons such as pension funds or charities. Since the unit holders are themselves exempt, it is provided in section 731 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, that the unit trust is also exempt from capital gains tax. To avoid an unnecessary tax imposition followed by repayment, there has been a long stand<Col N="189" /> ing practice that the unit trusts are also exempt from income tax. This amendment puts that income tax exemption on a statutory basis and also gives a consequential exemption from deposit interest retention tax. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 113:</P>
      <P>In page 201, to delete lines 7 to 10, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)(i) there shall be a disposal of an asset if there would be such a disposal for the purposes of the Capital Gains Tax Acts, and</P>
      <P>(ii) where, on the death of a person, an asset which the person was competent to dispose, is a material interest in an offshore fund to which this Chapter applies, then, notwithstanding section 573(2)(<i>b</i>), such material interest shall be deemed to be disposed of and reacquired by the person immediately before the death of the person for a consideration equal to its then market value,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to section 70 of the Bill which relates to the taxation of investments in offshore funds. The taxation treatment of domestic life assurance policies and policies issued from certain other countries has, in so far as possible, been made broadly similar as has the taxation treatment of domestic collective funds and offshore funds based in those countries, that is, other member states of the European Union, member states of the EEA and OECD countries with which we have a double taxation agreement. The amendment makes technical corrections to section 70 of the Bill in order that tax charges can arise in respect of investments in these foreign funds, even on the death of the investor. This is the case with domestic funds. It is also provided that the tax on any income gained from investing in offshore funds cannot be reduced in setting off any losses which the investor may otherwise have available. This levels the playing field with domestic funds which impose an exit tax on payments. Any tax payable on the death of an investor may be set off against any capital acquisitions tax arising on the same event. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    <P>This amendment is to section 71 of the Bill which relates to special investment schemes. These <Col N="191" /> schemes were introduced in the Finance Act, 1993, along with other savings products, with the objective of keeping money in the country in light of capital liberalisation. All these products at that time had a favourable 10% tax rate. This product is a unit trust with an investment focus on Irish equities. As there is now no tax advantage attached to this product, I provided in last year's Finance Act that no new investment could be made in them from 1 January last. This amendment provides two further changes. One, the investment focus on Irish equities has been removed, and, two, the <Col N="192" /> condition that the value of the individual's investment be reduced to £75,000 every five years has been removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The foot and mouth disease scare has great cost implications for many sectors of the economy, but, if there was an outbreak of the disease here, the costs would be a thousand times greater than they are at present. In that regard, we hope the incident in County Louth tonight will prove negative.</P>
      <P>The co-operation of the public is heart-warming, but given that structures are in place to keep out foot and mouth disease, it is time to consider if the great financial hardship currently imposed on farmers can be alleviated without lessening the effort or the effect of the preventative measures. I am sure the Minister has received calls from worried farmers who are owed various grants from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. As the normal practice of on-farm inspections has ceased, many of the cheques have also stopped. A farmer who is waiting for the special beef premium, which was due a month ago, cannot get it because there was supposed to be an on-farm inspection. He was told yesterday that he could not get the premium until the inspection was made. Another farmer is awaiting a REPS payment, but he was also told it cannot be paid without a farm inspection.</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development concerning bringing forward the 2001-02 ewe premium scheme instalments. The retention date expires on 7 April and it should be possible to bring it forward by a considerable number of weeks this year because of the current position. The months of April, May and June will be vital this year in terms of cash flow on many farms, particularly sheep farms. The sheep trade is great at present, but only for farmers who have suitable animals to sell. As the Minister is aware, the vast majority of low land and hill sheep farmers do not have lambs to sell at this time of year. They will not have animals to sell until June or July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue is the so-called small technical problem where various grants are being held up pending farm visits and clarification. There are many such cases and much more desk work should be done with the many telephones that are available. I am aware of cases where two or three telephone calls from the Department would rectify the problems and ensure cheques can be issued. I assume this is what the Minister also wants, but unless he and the Department set up that arrangement now, it will not happen <Col N="195" /> for another two or three weeks because it will take that long to clear the backlog.</P>
    <P>There should not be a problem paying instalments because 99% of farmers will be due other payments during the year and excess amounts could be clawed back. The Department has a section which is good at clawing back money. Plenty of money is deducted from premia when it suits so there is no problem with the system which is working extremely well.</P>
    <P>Most farmers have stock on their farms that they would not normally have at this time of year. In the Minister's part of the world, dairy farmers have no room for calves. Farms are bursting at the seams. Dry stock farmers in other parts of the country, including my area, traditionally have store cattle ready to sell now. This is their livelihood and how they do business. However, they cannot go outside the door at present. In the midlands, farmers usually go to the west to buy cattle at this time of the year. Unless they have an off-farm income, these farmers have no income at present. Everybody hopes the country escapes foot and mouth disease and that the regulations in place will ensure the disease is kept out. However, given that the disease is rampant in Britain, we will have a problem throughout this year.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I ask the Minister to establish a group in the Department and ensure, where possible, that money can be paid. This process should start tomorrow. I ask the Minister to put the wheels in motion tomorrow because if it is not done then, I know from experience that it will not happen for several months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation to Deputy Connaughton for raising this important matter at a time when the people, the agriculture industry, large sectors of the tourism industry and the economy in general are experiencing great apprehension and worry. I appreciate the Deputy's comments in relation to the solidarity of the country's citizens and particularly the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Garda, the Army and all the State agencies who rowed in, in a most self-less way, in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised the worrying scare in County Louth. A farm in County Louth has been restricted and we are following the same procedures as in any other case which was of concern over the past four weeks. The process is to restrict and slaughter the flock and to take appropriate samples and have them sent for analysis to the international reference laboratory in Pirbright. We all hope the results will be negative. The results were due this evening but they will not be <Col N="196" /> available until tomorrow because of the backlog of samples.</P>
    <P>This case is within the exclusion zone which arose from the outbreak at Meigh. As a precaution the controls have been further intensified, especially at the likely perimeter of any protection zone, where Garda reinforcements have today been assigned. The outcome of the laboratory analysis will determine any further action and we must await this.</P>
    <P>In view of the intensity of the effort devoted to keeping out foot and mouth disease this is an anxious time for the country at large, including the agri-business and agri-tourism sectors, the general economy and those directly involved in the front line of the battle against this disease. As I have been saying from day one, we must remain on high alert and do all in our power to prevent an outbreak of this devastating disease.</P>
    <P>Turning to the matters raised by Deputy Connaughton, under the various 2000 headage and premium schemes, £654 million has already been paid. This compares with £621 million paid during the same period last year. Since 1 January, almost 352,000 cheques, valued at more than £163 million, have issued to farmers under various headage and premia schemes. Some £40 million of these payments have been made since the beginning of March. I am making arrangements to make EURO compensation payments under the livestock schemes before the end of March, entailing some 270,000 cheques valued at £14 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton and other Deputies inquired to what extent payments could continue to be made in view of the fact that farmers have restricted the movement of animals and in some cases cannot sell them to other farmers, especially calves from the southern part of the country and store cattle. Payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium commenced on 31 January and 94% of applicants were paid within the first two days. With regard to special beef premium, balancing payments commenced on 7 February. Overall, 97% of applicants have been paid almost £184 million.</P>
    <P>The final instalment under the ewe premium scheme was paid on 16 February, the earliest possible date following publication of the regulation. In fact, 97% of applicants under this scheme were paid the first instalment in one day and more than £77.4 million has been paid to sheep producers under that scheme.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the 2000 slaughter premium scheme and the national envelope balancing payments cannot commence until the quota usage for the year is determined. The vast bulk of payments that can be made are being made. I am aware of the difficulties arising because staff cannot visit the farms. We will see to what extent we can be helpful here.</P>
    <P>The high level of direct payments made under the various schemes are of considerable benefit <Col N="197" /> to farmers, especially at this difficult time. Significant amounts of money have been paid since the foot and mouth situation developed. I have instructed the relevant sections of my Department and the IT staff to ensure this continues. Arrangements are in train to continue with payments where possible in the coming weeks.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Vaccine Toxicity.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for his attendance. On 27 February he announced that he had directed the health boards to trace the 296 children immunised with the Kenneth Best vaccine, Trivax DTP vaccine batch 3741. At the time when the vaccine was being administered in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a huge upsurge in the number of severe reactions in children who received the Trivax vaccine. Serious questions overhang the vaccine and its manufacture, so much so that the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton in the Best case described Glaxo Wellcome, the manufacturers of the vaccine, as negligent and criticised the company's quality control procedures.</P>
      <P>While the announcement by the Minister to contact the children administered with vaccine batch 3741 is welcome, why is the same not to be done with other suspected batches? Why is the Department continuing to rely solely on the information provided by Glaxo Wellcome to substantiate the claim that no other batches gave rise to the same level of potential concern? Had it not been for Margaret Best would the same response not continue to be forthcoming from Glaxo Welcome in relation to vaccine batch 3741?</P>
      <P>During the Kenneth Best case, when questioned under cross examination by Mr. Dermot Gleeson as to whether other batches of similar or greater potency were released, Mr. Peter Knight, manager of the immunological product support group of the Glaxo Wellcome Foundation stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There may have been a half dozen, a dozen or a 100 more. . . Goodness knows what I would have found if I had looked wider.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does this not give rise to the same level of potential concern as vaccine batch 3741?</P>
      <P>At approximately the same time as this batch was being released and administered, another batch of greater potency, batch 3732, was also released. This batch was 16 times greater than the British standard at that time. Batch 3741 was 14 times greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From May 1968, 14 batches of vaccine which were not subjected to the mouse weight gain test were released. This was a standard test at the time, both in the US and the WHO. Such tests were administered from January 1969 and January 1970. During the period there was an enormous increase in the reactions to the vaccines, so <Col N="198" /> much so that it induced Dr. Griffith of the department of clinical immunology of the Glaxo Wellcome research laboratories to suggest that the vaccine should be withdrawn at the start of 1970. Does this not give to the same level of potential concern?</P>
    <P>In 1973 the Eastern Health Board records show that the official in charge of the administration of the vaccine within that region was inundated with reports of severe reactions among children. She wrote to Glaxo Wellcome to express concern and the company replied it had no indications whatsoever as to the reason for these, yet three years earlier Dr. Griffith had raised them. The pertussis or whooping cough element of the three-in-one vaccine is widely believed to have been responsible for the adverse reactions and the Eastern Health Board asked Glaxo Wellcome about the possibility of reducing or altering this element. The board was extremely concerned because a number of lots were causing reactions with greater frequency. This gave rise to further cause for concern.</P>
    <P>By 1974 in Ireland, the extent of the reactions to the three-in-one vaccine was such that more than 50% of parents were opting not to choose it but the two-in-one vaccine, omitting the pertussis cover. The Government and the Department of Health and Children spokespersons have consistently played down the reports of the reaction to the vaccine but it is privately acknowledged, both in the Department and among GPs, that a lack of a structured reporting regime was preventing them from getting the full picture at that time.</P>
    <P>Since 1977, when the expert medical group was established, there has been at least 32 severe reactions to Trivax vaccine, in nine of which the outcome remains unknown. Why have these cases not been investigated in a similar manner to batch 3741? I reiterate my call that the only way this issue can be properly dealt with is through a public inquiry. Those involved deserve answers and the truth behind this scandal. I also call on the Minister to take similar action to that taken to date in relation to the batch 3741 children, to get the information from the Glaxo Wellcome Foundation and to release it to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain the efforts made by my Department to obtain information on the usage of certain batches of Trivax vaccine in Ireland. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and pay tribute to him for the persistent manner in which he has raised such issues over many years on behalf of a number of families and parents across the country. The background to this issue is that following the Supreme Court judgment in the Best case in 1992, efforts were made to establish the extent to which other persons might also have received vaccine from the batch concerned. From time to time my <Col N="199" /> Department has been approached on behalf of a number of individuals whose families believe they may have suffered damage as a result of receiving three-in-one vaccine, seeking assistance in tracing the batch or lot numbers administered in these cases.</P>
      <P>In 1993 my Department wrote to the manufacturer and the health boards requesting information on the usage of vaccine from the batch concerned, No. 3741, but it was not possible to establish the extent of the distribution of the batch. Following extensive searches, the health boards did not trace in any immunisation records continuing references to batch 3741. At that time the number of lots which had been produced from batch 3741 were not available from the Department and it was not realised that the lot numbers were the key to ascertaining what usage was documented.</P>
      <P>After further consider in 1997 the Department asked Glaxo Wellcome whether the vaccine may have been identified by lot rather than batch number. Information in response to this inquiry, and indicating the lot numbers of vaccine produced from batch 3741, was obtained from the manufacturer in 1997 and 1998. With the information concerned, it was possible to ask the health boards to examine their records again to see whether there was information available on the usage of vaccine from the batch concerned. After extensive efforts by the health boards, four boards found records which documented 296 cases of persons who received vaccine from batch 3741. It would appear reasonable, however, to assume that vaccine from the batch concerned was administered more widely than in the cases documented in the records traced.</P>
      <P>The report which I published on 27 February sets out in detail the information which has been obtained and I have asked the health boards to endeavour to contact the individuals concerned to inform them that they received this product. I understand the four health boards concerned are at present making arrangements to trace the persons involved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to other vaccine lots which he considers should also have been followed up in the same manner. In the House on 4 February 1999 he referred to another batch which, he said, had failed the toxicity test, and to some 14 other batches manufactured over a 12 month period from May 1968 and which, he said, were not subjected to this toxicity test. Subsequent to this, on 12 February 1999, the Department wrote again to Glaxo Wellcome seeking information on the issues raised. The company was asked to indicate, if possible, whether vaccine from these batches might have been distributed in Ireland and, if so, whether the relevant lot numbers were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> The company's response of 12 March 1999 indicated that a variety of tests were used to analyse Trivax in the late 1960s and that all batches of Trivax released for sale complied with the mandatory requirements at that time. It added that the results of all tests, mandatory and otherwise, together with the expert advice which it had sought, indicated that no other batch gave rise to the same level of potential concern as batch 3741.</P>
    <P>The Deputy again raised issues regarding other batches of Trivax vaccine in the House on 19 May 1999 and the Department wrote to the company about these also. The company's final response, received in September 1999, was to the effect that it had made every effort to provide as much information as possible to the Department in response to queries regarding the Trivax vaccine. The Deputy has been provided with copies of this correspondence under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act. He will, therefore, appreciate that this matter has already been pursued by my Department. Extensive international research has been conducted over many years regarding the possible link between the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine and chronic brain damage and that such a link has not been proven. The consensus of the international literature on this subject is that wholecell pertussis vaccine has not been proven to be a cause of brain damage.</P>
    <P>By publishing the report I have set out clearly and comprehensively all of the information obtained by my Department about the issues involved. I and my officials are willing to meet the Deputy to further consider these issues and to provide whatever assistance I can on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Castleisland Garda station dates back to the time of the RIC. It was the target of an arson attack on 3 March forcing the gardaí who man the station to move into two portacabins at the rear of the station which neither in its former nor present condition is suitable for the two sergeants and six gardaí to carry out their normal every day policing duties.</P>
      <P>The building has no cells in which to detain prisoners, private interview room, public toilet, changing room or showers for the gardaí and so on. It is obvious that the building cannot be used as a Garda station. The gardaí are now forced to operate in the two portacabins. They find it extremely difficult to carry out their duties in these restricted and unusual surroundings. However, they are to be commended on doing such an efficient job in these difficult circumstances and I acknowledge that publicly in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Castleisland Garda station is currently manned by two sergeants and six gardaí. It is made up of two members in each unit, A, B, C and D. The sub-district covers an area of about 96 square <Col N="201" /> miles and there is one patrol car attached to the station. The national primary roads, the N21 and N22, meet at Castleisland and there is a large volume of traffic entering the town especially in the summer when tailbacks of up to one mile are experienced. Castleisland is regarded as the main gateway to Kerry resulting in constant traffic monitoring by the local gardaí. The town has a population of 2,500 who are resident in the town and there are about 2,500 people in the immediate hinterland. At night, the town is very busy especially at the weekends. With only two gardaí on duty they are stretched to the limit. They operate on foot to create high visibility on the streets and prevent disturbances. When arrests have to be made the gardaí escort the prisoners on foot to the station where they are charged. A prisoner who has to be detained is taken to Killarney, 17 miles away, because there are no cells at Castleisland. Taking a prisoner to Killarney leaves Castleisland vulnerable as the gardaí will be away for an hour and a half. Obviously people on the streets are aware of that.</P>
    <P>There is need for extra gardaí on each unit as this would allow for a patrol car to patrol the area and be available to take prisoners to the station. It would also deter potential wrongdoers. Five members of the Garda operate as immigration officers at Kerry airport during the summer when there is an increase in the number of cross-channel flights. This puts further pressure on the available manpower at that time.</P>
    <P>Crime levels in the Castleisland area over the past three years have been contained to a reasonable level by the hard working gardaí in the station. In 2000, some 50 crimes were committed with a 48% detection rate; 360 warrants were received at the station and 340 of these were executed; 448 summonses were brought before the court and 263 on the spot fines were issued. The gardaí also work with four community watch groups in the area. These operate very successfully in Cordal, Ballymacelligott, Scartaglin and in Castleisland.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that as well as providing a new Garda barracks at Castleisland there is need for an increased number of gardaí. There should be three members on each unit to ensure members working at night do so in safety. This would allow a patrol car to operate on each tour of duty. A clerical assistant should be assigned to the station to allow the sergeant in charge to attend to operational duties and not be tied down with clerical work. The local development association in the town has identified three suitable sites for a Garda station. One of these is now for sale. The sites may not be available indefinitely and I urge the Minister to act immediately and acquire one.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is driving through Castleisland on his way home this week he should visit the station and see for himself the working conditions of the gardaí at first hand. He would <Col N="202" /> realise it is now time to provide the long awaited Garda station for Castleisland town and district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and affording me an opportunity to explain the latest position with regard to Castleisland Garda station.</P>
      <P>Castleisland Garda station in the Kerry Garda division is a sub-district station with a party of eight members, as Deputy Dennihan said, two sergeants and six gardaí. On 3 March this year the station was subjected to an arson attack and suffered severe smoke damage throughout. As a result, immediate portacabin facilities were provided in the yard to the rear of the station. This has enabled the Garda to continue to provide a full service for the local community despite the damage to the main station.</P>
      <P>I am sure that all Members will share my serious concern at this attack on the station. Fortunately, no one was injured in the station or adjacent properties. I understand that an early arrest was made and the matter is now before the courts. Urgent arrangements are being made to relocate the station party to more suitable temporary accommodation close by in the town. In this regard, the Office of Public Works has commenced negotiations with the owner of a local premises with a view to securing the premises for Garda use. I hope these negotiations will be successful and concluded quickly. In the longer term, what is required is a new station. The Department and the Garda authorities are in consultation as to the appropriate ranking of Castleisland on the Garda building programme priority list. It will be appreciated that all such major building projects must proceed in accordance with the priorities of the Garda building programme. This programme is designed to ensure the ordered, timely and economically efficient construction or major refurbishment of Garda stations as policing requirements demand and overall priorities allow.</P>
      <P>There are a number of building projects which require attention before work may proceed in Castleisland. The Minister cannot, therefore, give an indication at this time as to when construction of a new station in Castleisland will commence. It is important to bear in mind that a great deal of work has been done in recent years to improve standards of accommodation at Garda stations throughout the country. It is, however, a large scale operation. This programme of improvement has a high priority both with the Minister and the Government. This year, for instance, just over £17 million has been provided for major new construction projects in the Office of Public Works Vote and £6.8 million has been provided for the maintenance of Garda stations in the Garda Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> Gardaí occupy some 703 Garda stations and other units of accommodation throughout the country, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda headquarters and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied by them were built before the foundation of the State and designed, as Deputy Deenihan said, for a different era. This extensive resource, while invaluable in guaranteeing the provision of police services for the community, creates its own unique maintenance and refurbishment demands. Consequently, all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure it meets the operational requirements of the force. Where it does not, then necessary works will be prioritised and completed with the appropriate degree of urgency.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been done in recent years to improve the situation and I am sure Members will acknowledge the improvements to Garda stations and the new stations built in recent years throughout the country. I thank Deputy Deenihan for bringing the situation in Castleisland to the attention of the House and hope negotiations will be concluded quickly in regard to more suitable temporary accommodation close by in the town.</P>

      <P>In July 1999, the Victims Commission, under the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, issued its report entitled, A Place and a Name. The commission was established in compliance with the section of the Good Friday Agreement entitled, Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity. The commission received submissions from many people affected directly and indirectly by the past 30 years of conflict. I accompanied a number of people who had suffered bereavement and displacement to meet the commission. Some were victims of British state violence while others were victims of loyalist violence. To them, and many others in this jurisdiction, the commission was a long overdue opportunity to tell their story and present their case.</P>
      <P>The commission offered some hope that amends would be made for the neglect of successive Governments. When the report was issued, there was much anger on the part of the victims and relatives of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings that it did not recommend a full public inquiry. In subsequent talks with the Government, their representative group, Justice for the Forgotten, secured assurances that there would be an initial inquiry conducted by a senior judge and that this would report to an Oireachtas committee. The initial inquiry is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of the report was naturally dominated by the Dublin and Monaghan bom<Col N="204" /> bings case in respect of which I reiterate my support for a full public inquiry. The commission made a range of other recommendations which were welcomed by Justice for the Forgotten and others. I record with dismay and disappointment that no action has been taken on these recommendations.</P>
    <P>Let me run briefly through some of the recommendations. In each case, there is no evidence of Government action. There was no action on help for those suffering from trauma, including the establishment of trauma teams in health board areas and outreach programmes for past victims of the conflict. There was no action on funds to be made available to provide acknowledgment payments for the families of those killed and to cover victims' continuing costs arising from injuries done to them. There was no action on a victim's pension to be established for certain categories of victims. There was no action on a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme. There was no action on procedures to be introduced to allow families to request reports on investigations into deaths arising from the conflict where no one has been made amenable. There was no action on the publication of the Crowley report on the shooting dead of Aidan McAnespie by the British Army on the Monaghan-Tyrone border in 1988. There was no action in regard to the Government urging the British Government to publish the Stalker-Sampson report on RUC shoot-to-kill policy and the Stevens report into collusion between the RUC and loyalists. There was no action on payments of up to £10,000 for bereaved families or injured persons who have had to move to this jurisdiction as a result of the conflict and can show economic need. There was no action on a relocation grant of up to £5,000 to assist those bereaved and injured who now wish to return to this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>This is an appalling record on the part of the Government. It is doubly damning when one takes into account the fact that the Victims Commission in the Six Counties was established earlier, reported earlier and many of its recommendations have already been implemented. When the Victims Commission report of Mr. John Wilson was published in July 1999, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised a three month period of consideration of, and consultation on, the report. This was to be followed by action on implementation within a further three months. That brought us to February 2000. Over a year later, we have no evidence that anything has been done. It gives me no joy to ask if is the intention of the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to do anything to implement these recommendations made after serious consideration and consultation or will the Victims Commission report of Mr. Wilson join the hundreds of others gathering dust on Government shelves?</P>

      <P>The Victims' Commission, the sole member of which was former Tánaiste, John Wilson, was established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in May 1998. The Minister established the commission, with Government approval, in the context of the section of the Good Friday Agreement dealing with reconciliation and the victims of violence. That section recognised that the suffering of the victims of violence must be acknowledged and addressed as an essential element of reconciliation. The Agreement also recognised the importance of providing services that are supportive of and sensitive to the needs of victims. In line with those commitments, the commission's terms of reference were to conduct a review of services in place in this jurisdiction to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Ireland over the previous 30 years and to identify what further measures need to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering and concerns of those in question. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provided the staffing and other resources required by the commission.</P>
      <P>Mr. Wilson invited interested individuals and groups to meet the commission or make submissions to it. After meeting and listening to a wide range of victims, voluntary groups and official bodies, as Deputy Ó Caoláin said, he presented his report, A Place and a Name, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in July 1999. The Government is grateful to Mr. Wilson for the onerous task he undertook in meeting and listening to victims and others and for the sensitivity with which he carried out that task. A similar report to his, &ldquo;We will remember them&rdquo;, was published in Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Victims' Commission, the sole member of which was Sir Kenneth Bloomfield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Wilson's report sets out with great sensitivity what the victims told him. Building on what he was told by the victims as well as by the voluntary groups and official bodies, he made a series of wide ranging and ambitious recommendations, almost 50 in all, covering many different areas. He addressed the issues of dealing with the emotional trauma suffered by the victims and the provision of financial support both to past and future victims &ndash; although we all pray that we will never again see victims of such violence in our country. He made recommendations regarding medical issues, which have arisen, and those in the service of the State who have become victims. He addressed the area of truth and justice, including dealing with such atrocities as the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974 and the question of memorials and commemorations. He made recommendations for alleviating the plight of displaced persons and those who suffered economic loss. He addressed the need for awareness and <Col N="206" /> sensitivity to victims' needs and concerns. He made suggestions on how his recommendations might be implemented.</P>
    <P>Work has already commenced on implementing a number of the report's recommendations. Independent commissions of inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the Dundalk bombing of 1975 were established in December 1999 to undertake a thorough examination, involving fact finding and assessment of all aspects of the bombings and the sequel, including the facts, circumstances, causes and perpetrators of the bombings; the nature, adequacy and extent of Garda investigation; and the reasons prosecutions did not take place. The then outgoing Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, agreed to undertake the inquiries. Due to ill-health, Mr. Hamilton was forced to resign in September 2000 and was succeeded by Mr. Justice Henry Barron, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. Sadly, Mr. Hamilton died soon after. I and the Government appreciate the significant work he did on these commissions. I look forward to the completion of Mr. Barron's work. The result of his examination of the issues will be presented to the Government, to be followed by an examination of the report in public session by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>Work has also commenced on implementation of other recommendations. Mr. Wilson recommended that support be provided to deal with the emotional and psychological aspects of major incidents. The Department of Health and Children has provided funding to health boards for this purpose. Mr. Wilson recommended a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme. A comprehensive review of the scheme, taking into account Mr. Wilson's recommendations, is currently under way in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister hopes to receive a report on that matter shortly.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that the report's recommendations cover a wide range of areas which fall within the areas of competency of a number of Departments and agencies. To allow the responsible Departments and agencies maximum flexibility, many of Mr. Wilson's recommendations are formulated in general terms. For some time the Departments and agencies have been examining the recommendations with a view to seeing how they might best be implemented to the maximum benefit of those whom they are intended to help. Deputies will appreciate that this work is quite complex. However, progress continues to be made and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform expects to be in a position to be able to announce in the near future details of progress made on implementing more of the <Col N="207" /> recommendations and of how the remaining recommendations will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government strongly believes the victims of the Troubles have a right, in the words of the Good Friday Agreement, to have their suffering acknowledged and addressed. Even more than that, to ensure that the peace process takes firm <Col N="208" /> root in our island it is essential that the needs of victims are addressed. For those reasons, the Government attaches great importance to the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Victims' Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to correspondence dated 20 November 2000 which the Wicklow County Manager addressed to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and which was copied to my Department.</P>
      <P>The correspondence outlined a profile of the project currently being promoted by Wicklow County Council which involves a development of the Greystones Harbour and North Beach area involving among other things, a marina, coastal protection works and a residential development.</P>
      <P>I understand the council, in copying the correspondence to my Department, has made specific proposals for changes in the tax code by the Minister for Finance which the council believes will assist in attracting financial backers whose participation is critical to the project's success. In particular, these proposals are aimed at amending current tax incentive schemes to include marina developments and coastal protection works approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that at present my Department's role in approving coastal developments is confined to the issuing of foreshore leases under the Foreshore Acts 1933-88. The foreshore lease focuses primarily on the physical effect of the development, and involves consultation, planning permission and a public notice process.</P>
      <P>The general direction for marine tourism development for the next six years is set in the national development plan and more specifically the marine tourism grant scheme which will be administered by my Department. The grant scheme, which is currently being developed in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation for launch later this year, will be targeted at improving marine tourism access infrastructure and encouraging integrated development and co-operative partnerships, particularly in relation to networks and clusters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> While I would generally be supportive of the project being promoted by Wicklow County Council, particularly as it appears to be broadly in line with the criteria my Department will set down under the forthcoming scheme, nevertheless, the proposals put forward in relation to amendments to the tax code are entirely a matter for the Minister for Finance, and my Department has no role in pursuing such proposals. My Department has, however, indicated to the Greystones Harbour Plan Liaison Committee that it will be happy to look at any draft terms of reference which might be drawn up for a tax implications study aimed at examining this issue more closely, focusing in particular on the inclusion of elements in such projects which meet public policy objectives, for example, coastal protections.</P>

      <P>Schull Pier is owned by Cork County Council and its repair, maintenance and development is the responsibility of the local authority in the first instance. While Cork County Council is primarily responsible for the development of facilities at Schull, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources provides aid for development works at fishery harbours.</P>
      <P>The strategic fishery harbour in the West Cork area is, of course, Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre. I recently announced a major development package for Castletownbere. The Castletownbere development provides for an extension of the existing wharf at Dinnish Island, along with the construction of an Auction Hall. The planning application in respect of this development was lodged recently with Cork County Council and I am hopeful the development will commence before the end of the current year.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides, in total, a £60 million package for the upgrading and development of facilities at the key strategic fishery harbours and landing places. New and improved facilities will also be provided at smaller harbours and landing places, which will provide essential structures for the fishery and aquaculture industries.</P>
      <P>My Department has an extensive list of proposals for development works, comprising projects submitted for consideration by local authorities and industry sources. These projects are considered and approved on a priority basis.</P>
      <P>No proposals have been submitted by Cork County Council for the extension of a breakwater at Schull Pier. The scope for funding works at Schull will be kept under review by my Department in consultation with Cork County Council in light of available resources in forward years.</P>

      <P>Recently, having declared the field commercial, Enterprise Energy Ireland has submitted information in support of an application for a petroleum lease with a view to its development. All three companies will be partners in the lease with Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited holding a 45% interest, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited holding a 36.5% interest and Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited holding an 18.5% interest.</P>
      <P>I expect to grant a petroleum lease shortly to the partners. Within two years of the grant of the petroleum lease the lessee is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field. This detailed plan of development must include information on the design, siting, construction, establishment, operation, abandonment and removal of any facilities for the production, processing, storage, or transportation of petroleum produced under the petroleum lease. An environmental impact statement is also required. Development work by EEI, acting for the partners, cannot begin until I have approved the plan of development and the environmental impact statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will by now be aware, the final report of the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft, including Personal Watercraft, which was presented to me in April 2000, recommended the introduction of a new legislative framework to allow for the enactment by local authorities of by-laws to control the use of jet skis and fast power craft as an initial <Col N="212" /> step and also for regulations on national provisions governing the safe use of such craft.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the introduction of this legislative framework has now been achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which were included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000. As a result of these amendments, I, as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, am now empowered to introduce statutory regulations to take account not only of the safety of recreational craft, including jet skis and fast power craft, and their occupants, but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the craft and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage. Significantly, I am, as Minister, also empowered to provide local authorities and bodies with the power to introduce by-laws to control the use of such craft in areas under their jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of drafting regulations which will allow for the enactment of such by-laws. These regulations will also include, <i>inter alia,</i> provisions relating to age restrictions, the carriage and use of life jackets, restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs as well as provisions relating to careless and dangerous driving of jet skis and fast power craft. It is my intention that these draft regulations will be finalised shortly in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, so that their implementation will be achieved in time for the coming summer season.</P>

      <P>I can confirm for the Deputy that the new round of investment support measures for the fishing fleet and the broader seafood industry is close to finalisation. An unprecedented level of funding totalling £171 million will underpin overall investment strategies for the sector under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the significant difficulties which have emerged in relation to labour shortages combined with declines in fish stocks are factors which had to be considered in bringing this initiative to fruition. In this climate we must ensure that short and long-term strategies are targeted to secure the viability and competitiveness of the fleet now and into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> My Department is working with BIM to finalise the detailed grant schemes which will strategically focus on the enhancement of the safety, quality and competitiveness of the whitefish fleet. Investment schemes to assist in the purchase of new and modern secondhand vessels and in modernisation of existing vessels and purchase and installation of life saving equipment will be included in the new programme. I can also confirm to the Deputy that a special scheme to assist younger fishermen acquiring a vessel for the first time will be an important element of the new initiative.</P>
    <P>EU State aid approval has been sought for the fleet investment measures and negotiations with the EU Commission are nearing completion. I intend to announce details of the new fleet modernisation programme once this approval has been secured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the high level of fatalities and accidents on fishing vessels. I am very conscious that our fishermen go about their daily work in an often hostile and dangerous environment and, at the outset, I have to say that the safety of fishermen is a matter to be addressed primarily by skippers, owners and crews. That being said, the State has done and will continue to persuade, support and coerce all persons involved in fishing to acquire equipment and adopt practices aimed at improving safety.</P>
      <P>My Department's priority has been to implement the recommendations and objectives of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group. Considerable progress has been made in the areas of radio regulations, safety regulations for vessels over 24 metres, safety training, onshore marine radio communications, fleet modernisation, the establishment of a network of offshore weather and research buoys, and safety awareness. Work is well advanced on draft safety regulations for smaller sizes of fishing boats. Following on from my announcement on 28 January last that it was my intention to put in place new legislation which will see the introduction of mandatory safety training and mandatory wearing of suitable personal flotation devices for fishermen in Ireland, my Department will shortly be commencing a consultation process with the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet, announced in 1998, included a scheme for the provision of grant aid <Col N="214" /> for the purchase and installation of safety equipment under which more than £5 million was invested to equip almost 600 fishing vessels with more than 5,000 lifesaving devices.</P>
    <P>The initiative, announced under the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99, had a closing date for applications of 31 December 1999, however, expenditure under the safety grant scheme has been ongoing throughout 2000 and into 2001 as projects came on stream.</P>
    <P>Since the start of 2000, 268 skippers and their crews have benefited from funding for the purchase and installation of life-saving equipment, 39 vessels have received grant aid towards modernisation and a further 24 new and six modern second-hand vessels have been delivered to their new owners.</P>
    <P>In parallel, and following agreement with the Commission during 2000 on the Community Support Framework 2000-2006, the new round of investment support strategies for the fleet and the seafood industry as a whole is being put in place. My Department is working with BIM on finalising the detailed grant schemes which will strategically focus on the enhancement of the safety, quality and competitiveness of the whitefish fleet.</P>
    <P>As part of the 2000-06 programme a new vessel safety scheme is being put in place, the details of which have been submitted to the EU Commission and can be launched when state aid approval is acquired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my reply to a similar question raised in the House on 8 February, there will be a substantial increase this year in offshore drilling activity with at least three exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled. However, well commitments beyond 2001 amount to only between three and six for the entire Irish offshore. With this in mind, I commenced an initiative aimed at both conserving certain areas of the Irish offshore by closing them off from development for the moment and gauging interest on the part of the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas. To that end, I have started a consultation process involving companies who are licence holders here to gauge their view on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licences might be offered and this process is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 21 offshore exploration licences in place at present compared with a peak of 32 in 1997. Furthermore, a number of exploration com<Col N="215" /> panies granted licences under a licensing round in 1997 have indicated their intention to relinquish these licences this year. Only one exploration well was drilled in the Irish offshore in the last three years, despite the existence of the 1992 terms.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Irish prospectivity is low with only three successful exploration wells out of 122 wells in 30 years. The Corrib gas find, although very welcome, cannot be regarded as changing that view. Irish offshore prospectivity is not comparable with, for example, the United Kingdom which has over the same period drilled about 3,000 wells of which about 250 are in production. Also, we are competing not just with the relatively low risk, highly prospective North Sea but also with current development hot spots in north and west Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and the Caspian region.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 43 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to Priority Question No. 23, I outlined the measures adopted by my Department to combat the spread of foot and mouth disease. Deputies can be assured that the position is under active review on an ongoing basis, and that all necessary action will be taken as part of the Government's concerted programme for addressing this serious problem.</P>
      <P>The measures adopted do have practical implications for areas within my Department's remit. For example, the ban on farm visits, which has been imposed on forestry inspectors, is likely to lead to additional pressures when the restrictions are lifted. Similarly, in the aquaculture area, restrictions on travel by technical staff means that engineering and monitoring inspections are severely curtailed. This is likely to result in some delays in the processing of applications for aquaculture licences, foreshore leases, licences and permissions, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to mining, the measures taken have halted prospecting fieldwork, except where core <Col N="216" /> drilling is taking place on sites where precautions are being followed to the satisfaction of, and with prior agreement of, landowner and district veterinary office of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It is likely that short-term deferral of fieldwork can be accommodated without economic loss.</P>
    <P>Restrictions imposed on angling, as indicated in my reply to Priority Question No. 23 also have an impact on activities. While any disruption is regretted, Deputies will appreciate that the strict measures which have been adopted are necessary. Deputies can also be assured that as soon as this crisis ends, appropriate measures will be taken to restore the situation to normality.  </P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware my Department sought the advice of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Office of the Attorney General and counsel on issues arising in this case. The advice received is under consideration in my Department at present. Various issues raised by the advice are now being pursued with Iarnród Éireann and the Department of Public Enterprise. The legal advice does, however, tend to confirm that Iarnród Éireann may have powers to enter on to adjoining lands, including foreshore, to carry out works for the purposes of repair or the prevention of an accident.</P>
      <P>The exercise of these powers is, however, the subject of certain procedures which appear to be the responsibility of the Minister for Public Enterprise. The original legislation dates from 1842 and the trail of responsibility and process is not entirely clear.</P>
      <P>As I have said, these matters are being teased out with the Department of Public Enterprise and Iarnród Éireann. At this point, however, it would seem on both legal and practical grounds that our efforts would best be addressed at finding the optimum long-term solution.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. Over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 planned investment in the aquaculture sector is £57.2 million. The aquaculture measure, as provided under the regional operational programmes, will be funded by the EU's financial instrument for fisheries guidance and the Exchequer to a level of £24.17 million, with the private sector contributing the balance of funding amounting to £33.03 million. A public call for proposals was made earlier this year. However, applications were being accepted by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údaras na Gaeltachta since 1 January 2000. Applications for consideration under the first tranche of funding are currently being prioritised by the agencies with a view to selection by the Aquaculture Selection Board.</P>
      <P>The level of public investment is more than double the funding made available under the last round of structural funding and underlines Government commitment to the aquaculture industry as a sustainable industry providing jobs and economic growth for coastal communities. Direct employment in aquaculture is projected to increase from 1,225 on a wholetime equivalent basis in 1999 to 1,900 at the end of the programme.</P>
      <P>I am confident the funding available for aquaculture under the regional operational programmes will help deliver on the goals of critical mass, quality, sustainability, diversification, technology and cost competitiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in relation to fish stocks is a matter of considerable concern. There has been a decline in a number of key commercial roundfish stocks in recent years, particularly cod and hake. All cod stocks from the north of Norway to the Celtic Sea have declined in recent years. The extent to which the decline is due to overfishing or the impact of wider environmental factors is a matter of scientific debate. It appears that both factors have played a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address this situation Ireland has pressed, at successive Fisheries Councils, for the introduction of targeted stock recovery programmes. The first of these programmes was put in place for Irish sea cod in 2000 and this has been renewed for 2001. Cod recovery plans for North Sea cod and west of Scotland cod have recently been <Col N="218" /> agreed and a hake recovery plan is in the process of being finalised. These recovery plans all aim to give added protection to the adult spawning stock during the spawning season. Another key aim of the programmes is to ensure that a greater proportion of young fish are allowed to escape. It is envisaged that this will be achieved through greater selectivity as a result of changes to fishing gears.</P>
    <P>The initiatives being taken under the stock recovery plans will provide a model for the more extensive and enhanced conservation measures which Ireland is pursuing in respect of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy. This strategy has been set out in detail in the report of the national strategy review group on the CFP which has been presented to the European institutions and widely circulated in Brussels in the context of the forthcoming review. I look forward to participating in the upcoming debate on the CFP review and I will continue to press for a radical and farsighted approach to be taken in relation to the preservation of fish stocks.</P>

      <P>As part of a range of measures taken to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease to the State, I made a by-law prohibiting angling nationwide with effect from 3 March. This measure was taken following consultations with the central and regional fisheries boards and was in line with measures adopted by the Government acting with the greatest degree of caution commensurate with the risk of an outbreak of this very serious disease in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am aware this restriction has placed a considerable burden on the angling sector which is particularly vulnerable due to the niche nature of many enterprises. Accordingly, my Department at the earliest opportunity sought the advice of the expert group in relation to foot and mouth disease controls. On 16 March my Department received the recommendations of the expert group which allow for the lifting of the legal prohibition on angling with effect from 23 March. My Department is issuing guidelines which will be applicable to all involved in the angling sector from 23 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, angling activity may resume from 23 March subject to non-entry onto agricultural land to which animals susceptible to the disease <Col N="220" /> may have had access. This easing of the restrictions should allow for the resumption of ordinary angling activity in many cases, in particular lake and sea angling. Unfortunately, however, it remains the case that visiting anglers from the UK and other infected areas should be discouraged.</P>
    <P>In close co-ordination with my Government colleagues and with the advice of the expert group I will continue to monitor the need for and effect of the current restrictions. Furthermore, I will examine practical steps which can be taken to assist the sector to recover from this period when it is clear the disease no longer poses a threat to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 21 offshore exploration licences, seven licensing options and ten petroleum prospecting licences in place. This shows a decline from a peak of 32 exploration licences in 1997. Furthermore, a number of exploration companies granted licences under a licensing round in 1997 have indicated their intention to relinquish these licences in 2001.</P>
      <P>This year will see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity with at least three exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled. However, well commitments beyond 2001 amount to only between three and six for the entire Irish offshore. With this in mind I commenced an initiative aimed at both conserving certain areas of the Irish offshore by closing them off from development for the moment and gauging interest on the part of the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas. To that end, I have started a consultation process involving companies who are licence holders here in order to gauge their view on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licences might be offered and this process is ongoing. Any decisions on a new licensing round will be made in the light of that consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is, however, that Irish prospectivity is low with only three successful exploration wells out of 122 wells in 30 years. The Corrib gas find, although very welcome, cannot be regarded as changing that view. Irish offshore prospectivity is not comparable with, for example, the United Kingdom which has over the same period drilled about 3,000 wells of which about 250 are in production. We are also competing not just with the relatively low risk, highly prospective North Sea but also with current development &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; in <Col N="221" /> North and West Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and the Caspian region.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland expect that gas sales from the Corrib will commence at the earliest by July 2003. The company estimates the field to contain about one thousand million cubic feet of gas or about two-third the size of the Kinsale-Ballycotton fields. Having recently declared the field commercial, Enterprise Energy Ireland has made an application on behalf of itself and its partners Statoil and Marathon for a petroleum lease to develop the field which I expect to grant shortly.</P>
      <P>However, any development work leading to the extraction of oil and gas can only take place following my approval of a plan of development and an environmental impact statement which the company is required to submit in accordance with my Department's licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration and development.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in my reply of 8 February 2001 to a similar question raised by the Deputy, there are developments in relation to two hydrocarbon discoveries in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in the House on 8 February, Enterprise Energy Ireland declared the Corrib <Col N="222" /> gas field commercial in January this year on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil and Marathon, and sought a lease from me for its development. This is being considered and evaluated by my Department. Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expects the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
    <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department where it is analysed by my Department using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. Deputies will appreciate that all material associated with this assessment is commercially sensitive and therefore must remain confidential. However, Enterprise Energy Ireland is reported as saying that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of approximately one trillion cubic feet of gas. It would be difficult to estimate the commercial value of the Corrib gas find. This will depend on factors such as the size of the field, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of the well, the market price and the cost of development of the field.</P>
    <P>As regards the Helvick oilfield, the position is that Providence Resources completed an appraisal well on the oilfield in the Celtic Sea in September last year. The drilling and tests results have been reviewed in detail over the last few months. Although the tests results on the well confirmed the good reservoir and oil characteristics seen on the original Helvick oil discovery well in 1983, further detailed analysis has indicated that the Helvick reservoir is much smaller than had been hoped and is highly compartmentalised. Accordingly, Providence Resources has concluded that a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; development of Helvick cannot be justified. Following analysis of the data obtained in 2000 my technical advisers have indicated that Helvick is not commercial.</P>
    <P>Providence Resources has other interests in the Celtic Sea, which include blocks 50/6, 50/7 and 50/11 and the Ardmore gas prospect. The company has indicated that it remains committed to realising value from its Celtic Sea assets but the fact that Helvick cannot be made commercial has resulted in Providence Resources reviewing its plans for the Celtic Sea as a whole and conducting a strategic appraisal of a number of business development options. My Department is in discussion with Providence Resources about restructuring its authorisations in the east Celtic Sea.</P>

      <P>My Department has in place stringent controls governing the operation of fish farms. All salmon farm operators are required to implement comprehensive sea lice management arrangements which are independently monitored by the Marine Institute. These controls are also kept under continuous review in line with the policy objective for the sustainable development of aquaculture.</P>
      <P>Part of the overall strategy to underpin the highest environmental standards for the aquaculture industry includes the introduction in May 2000 of five aquaculture protocols. The protocols which were introduced with the support of the fish farming industry have been welcomed by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation, an international body whose remit is the conservation and protection of wild salmon stocks in the North Atlantic region. One of the protocols in question relates to sea lice monitoring and control, where experience gained over the past decade has enabled Ireland to become a world leader in the development of sea lice management and control strategies.</P>
      <P>In relation to conservation and management of sea trout generally I am pleased to inform the House that I am finalising arrangements for the establishment of a group to review existing strategies in terms of their efficiency and effectiveness and the advice of this group will inform my thinking on future directions for sea trout conservation, protection and development strategies.</P>

      <P>An integrated strategy to enhance the profitability and performance of the seafood processing sector is nearing completion. This strategy is informed by a comprehensive consultant's report into future directions for seafood processing which was published last month. The independent report, which was completed following comprehensive consultation with the seafood processing sector, sets out strategies to address the key challenges facing the sector and to develop the industry over the short to medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusions of the report are guiding formulation of the overall strategy for investment support measures for the sector under the NDP. Key challenges identified in the study include strategies for improving the competitive position of seafood products on international markets, the scale of the industry, value added and research and development priorities, the consistency of <Col N="225" /> raw material supply and capacity utilisation within the sector.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan £25 million in grant aid, leading to total investment of some £100 million, will accelerate development of seafood processing to build a competitive, value added capability of scale to the highest quality and technological standards.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government is making an investment support package of approximately £25 million available to the aquaculture industry to achieve the sectoral strategic objectives and targets of the plan. This integrated package of financial, technical, environmental and quality supports provided under the NDP is intended to secure the future of the aquaculture sector as a whole, including intensively and extensively farmed shellfish, as well as providing a springboard for further major development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a major independent review of the State's 16 commercial regional ports, including Baltimore Harbour, was published in 1999. The review develops a general strategic framework for the ports and harbours concerned which aims to maximise their financial sustainability, their contribution to strategic maritime policy objectives and socio-economic impacts.</P>
      <P>In Baltimore's case the independent consultancy review recommends that the harbour be transferred to Cork County Council. Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners have indicated that they believe the best way forward is for the county council to take over the running of the harbour.</P>
      <P>The development requirements of Baltimore Harbour can only be considered in the context of such a transfer; competing demands for funding from the other regional ports which were the subject of the review; the overall priorities for coastal infrastructural development and in the light of funding available under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Baltimore Harbour Commissioners have submitted a comprehensive development plan, costed at some £8 million, which recommends the segregation of existing harbour activities &ndash; fishing, ferry service to islands and boating &ndash; enabled by dredging, breakwater construction, north pier Improvements, South Pier Improvements, dinghy park and a new marina. However, while Baltimore Harbour continues to operate under the Harbours Act, 1946, it is defunct in terms of commer<Col N="226" /> cial traffic and has very little income with revenue returns, mainly from recreational users, of less than £10,000 in each of the last four years.</P>
    <P>The seaports measure of the NDP will, set against the transformation of the key commercial seaports, assist the smaller regional harbours and ports whose operation in cargo handling is uneconomic, uncompetitive and unsustainable into the future, by investment in the transition to alternative uses, to ensure that they will continue to play a worthwhile and beneficial role in the local economies. The type of actions that are envisaged to be supported would include the preparation of area action-integrated development plans, feasibility studies and cost benefit analysis as well as design, planning and construction of appropriate waterfront development initiatives.</P>
    <P>In July last year I visited and inspected facilities at Baltimore Harbour. Following an in-depth discussion with the chairman, secretary and commissioners of Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Authority in relation to the harbour development plan, I confirmed that my Department would: co-finance the construction of a car park with a subvention of £125,000; liaise with the local authority and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in respect of Exchequer and-or national development plan financing for the development plan; and assist the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners to update the technical and financial aspects of the development plan.</P>
    <P>These actions will be progressed with the co-operation of the commissioners and Cork County Council. However, it would be inappropriate to raise any expectations, given the current and prospective development of traffic and revenue earning capacity at Baltimore, that I will be in a position to provide substantial grant assistance to the port.</P>

A report entitled, Youghal Coastal Defences, Further Studies, compiled by Posford Duvivier on behalf of Cork County Council has been examined in detail by officials in my Department. This report highlights options available relating to coast protection and maintenance of beach levels at Youghal. The report concludes, that the strengthening of the seawall and the provision of groyne <Col N="227" /> solutions at Youghal should be given further consideration. The total cost of such a project is estimated to be in the region of £3.7 million.</P>
      <P>The most urgent requirement at Youghal is the strengthening of the seawall. The design element of this project will cost in the region of £60,000. Funding of the design element is under consideration. Cork County Council submitted a proposal for funding of £400,000 to repair the existing seawall at Ballycotton. This proposal will be considered in the context of future coast protection programmes and the funding available for such works. I will continue to keep the coastal protection needs of east Cork in mind in the context of future coast protection funding decisions.</P>

      <P>The present position is that an Alouette 111 single engined helicopter is based at Waterford.

It is, however, well suited for mountain, cliff and close in marine search and rescue operations conducted by daylight in visual contact flight conditions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Alouette is in replacement on a temporary basis of the Dauphin which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen. I am conscious of the need to urgently upgrade the current unsuitable SAR helicopter service in Waterford and have pursued with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, how this might be achieved. I am happy to say that we have now commenced negotiations on a contract for the early provision of a new dedicated all weather, night flying medium lift helicopter capacity at Waterford.

      <P>In relation to mandatory safety training detailed arrangements are in the course of being made by my Department, in consultation with the statutory agencies, to prepare for the introduction of the new measures. Consideration is being given to many logistical issues such as how many fishermen will require training; how will the training be phased and over what period; how will the training be financed; where will the training be given and by whom; what elements need to be covered in the training course; how long will the training course be; how will it be verified that training has taken place; and where will the onus lie at the level of the fishing enterprise for ensuring that training requirements are met.</P>
      <P>All these issues will be subject to consultation with the fishing industry representative organisations in due course. The aim is to complete the consultation process by the end of April. The implementation of this initiative is a major undertaking and will take time but I am particularly determined that early progress should be made in respect of basic survival at sea training for new entrants to the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>As regards the mandatory wearing of personal flotation devices, as I indicated to the House in my reply to a parliamentary question on 8 February last, the task now is how to translate this decision in principle into a workable scheme. This involves, among other things, defining the quality of standards to be specified for the equipment to be worn, definition of where the onus is to be placed for ensuring compliance with the regulation and the preparation of the necessary statutory instruments. As I said in my reply of 8 February, this process will involve detailed consultation with the statutory agencies and the fishing industry. Consultation with the statutory agencies has taken place and the Department will be initiating consultation with the fishing industry very shortly.</P>
      <P>The aim is to have the consultation and analysis phase completed by the end of April. At that point I will take a decision on the basis of the advice then available on the timing of the publication of the legislation on the mandatory requirements.

      <P>While the responsibility for the configuration of distribution gas pipelines is a matter for commercial decision by Bord Gáis, BGE, and <Col N="229" /> for the Minister for Public Enterprise, I have been pursuing and will continue to pursue with them the question of having as many major towns as can be reached within BGE's commercial mandate connected to the natural gas network and to press for maximum availability of gas to areas which have currently been excluded.</P>
      <P>BGE is already committed to connecting the natural gas network to as many towns as can be reached within its commercial mandate. In addition to providing a gas supply to certain towns in the catchment area of the proposed pipeline and spur line, I understand BGE is examining the prospect of supplying gas to other centres of population in the north west as part of a national study to determine centres that can be supplied with gas on an economic basis. When this assessment has been completed, a fuller picture as to the costs and viability of such extensions will emerge. The Government recently gave approval in principle for the construction of spur pipelines to the north west of Ireland. It recognised that State funding will be required as BGE has a statutory obligation to extend gas networks to new areas of supply on a commercial basis only.</P>
      <P>My priority is to see the extension of the gas network and a new supply off the west coast used to accelerate economic development in the Border, midland and western region.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a thorough examination of the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into accident DH 248/rescue 111, Tramore, 2 July, 1999 took place in my Department. The following is an update on the response of my Department to the recommendations which relate specifically to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. It follows the numbering set out in the report.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.14. (S.R. 24 of 2000) &ndash; My Department has in place training programmes for coast guard units in dealing with hazardous situations. This training is being upgraded in the case of incidents of serious aircraft accidents. On 14 October, 2000, the chief fire officer at Shannon Airport delivered a lecture on the subject of downed aircraft search and approach techniques at the coast guard area officers' annual conference in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendation 4.15. (S.R. 25 of 2000) &ndash; My Department accepts the need for formalising cur<Col N="230" /> rent relationships and such agreements are at draft stage at present.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.16. (S.R. 26 of 2000) &ndash; My Department in its contract relationships with private operators ensures that appropriate agreements to the Department's satisfaction are in place between service providers and airport authorities. It should be noted that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is not a party to relationships between the Air Corps and airport authorities.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.21. (S.R. 31 of 2000) &ndash; My Department has an ongoing training and review programme in place which encompasses,<i> inter alia,</i> aviation awareness. One three week search and rescue mission co-ordinator's course has been attended by six staff and a two day aviation awareness module was introduced on that course. A second three week course of the same nature is being conducted at present.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.22. (S.R. 32 of 2000) &ndash; The maritime circumstances that gave rise to the rescue mission are well known and documented. Unfortunately, these circumstances are all too common despite continuing intensive media and publicity campaigns led by my Department assisted by the RNLI, Irish Water Safety, the Civil Defence, CIL and sporting, fishing and various representative organisations. The chief marine surveyor has advised that a formal investigation is not required as all the details are already available. The level of call out to assist leisure craft in difficulty is more than 300 annually. A key aim of my Department is to bring about a fundamental change in safety culture.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.25. (S.R. 35 of 2000) &ndash; My Department has to be satisfied when taking on private contractors that they will be fully capable and proficient in providing the required service from date of contract. The relationship with the Air Corps is not a contractual one and the matter of proficiency of crews and assets is primarily for the military authorities.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the detailed reply to a similar parliamentary question, No. 17 on 25 November, 1999. I am not aware of any more recent resolution of the council relating to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should Dublin Corporation decide to initiate procedures to breach the causeway at Bull Island it will be necessary for it to make prior appli<Col N="231" /> cation to my Department for a foreshore licence, lease or permission to allow this. The application will have to be accompanied by a full environmental impact statement and the impacts will be considered by the marine licensing vetting committee &ndash; MLVC &ndash; which is an advisory body comprising technical and scientific staff from both inside and outside my Department. It will also be subject to a full public consultation process. Having considered the views of the MLVC, submissions arising from the public consultation process and views of statutory consultees such as Dúchas, a report will be made to me and I will make a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also recall that, in response to Question No. 16 of 10 February 2000 on this subject, I advised him that my Department had conveyed approval for grant aid for the study of the effects of breaching the causeway to Dublin Corporation. I understand this study is ongoing and that funding has been made available to Dublin Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by explaining the background to this issue. The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, introduced a licensing regime for all boats carrying up to 12 passengers for reward either in the sea or freshwater. Until then only vessels capable of carrying more than 12 passengers for reward were required to be licensed. The 1992 Act made separate provision in section 19 for dealing with boats used for angling in the sea or freshwater for profit under which the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources was empowered to introduce regulations providing for the safety of such vessels and their crews.</P>
      <P>Sea angling boats taking anglers to sea for reward and going beyond three miles from land or 15 miles from their point of embarkation were required to be surveyed under the Loadlines Act, 1968 and to be issued with either a loadline certificate or a loadline exemption certificate. Sea angling boats operating within those limits were exempt from any requirement, as were freshwater angling boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guidelines were established by the marine survey office for the safe operation of sea angling boats holding certificates under the Loadlines Act, 1968. These guidelines did not apply to freshwater angling boats or sea angling boats operating within three miles of land and these <Col N="232" /> categories of boats were not subject to any survey requirements.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the commencement of the 1992 Act, draft regulations under section 19 were framed to require all boats used for sea angling as from the 1995 season to comply with survey and licensing requirements along the lines of the guidelines in place hitherto. Following consultation these regulations were not, however, proceeded with because of the perceived adverse affect on sea angling, especially where carried out in the context of festivals.</P>
    <P>The matter was addressed again in 1999 as part of a consultation process and draft regulations circulated in the context of these consultations. It emerged, however, that the proposed regulations could not be made under section 19. The legal advice at the time was that the latter was limited to the safety of a vessel and its crew and would not, therefore, apply to anyone who might be carried on board for reward or any other purpose.</P>
    <P>In the light of this advice and other representations made as part of the consultation process, it was decided to take advantage of a Bill in preparation for other purposes to amend the 1992 Act so as to provide that in the future all angling boats would be treated as passenger boats and, therefore, subject to survey and licensing under Part III of that Act. Section 44 of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, which effects this change, is now in force. This means that anyone who pays a boat operator to be taken to sea or out on a river or lake for any purpose, whether it is angling, fishing, sightseeing, pleasure, bird watching, dolphin watching, photography or whatever, is now to be treated in the same way and protected to the same extent through legislation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, work is now proceeding on the drafting of passenger boat regulations under section 18 of the 1992 Act. As some categories of angling boats have not been subject to regulation before now it is proposed to phase in the application to them of the new licensing requirement and the proposed regulations over a period to give the industry the opportunity to adapt to the proposed requirements. It has been decided that certain categories of angling boats will be exempt from the licensing requirements of the 1992 Act for the 2001 season, including boats used in sea angling festivals and competitions. It has been decided to exempt such boats on the understanding that they will comply as far as possible with the proposed safety requirements. Furthermore, for the 2001 season, organisers of sea angling festivals will be expected to observe additional requirements, on a voluntary basis, as guidelines. The longer term objective is that all boats used in sea angling festivals and competitions should be subject to licensing and the requirements applicable to passenger boats generally.</P>
    <P>My Department has prepared a consultation paper setting out its proposals for licensing and the requirements to be incorporated into the passenger boat regulations, as they apply to pass<Col N="233" /> enger boats used for angling purposes. This consultation paper is being circulated to interested bodies through the central and regional fisheries boards, with comments and observations being requested by 11 May. On receipt of the comments and observations arising out of the consultation process my Department will consider whether it may be useful to have a workshop/seminar on the subject.</P>

      <P>The status of cod stocks and the main commercially exploited stocks of fish and shellfish off the Irish coast and within EU waters generally is assessed annually by the relevant national scientists within a number of working groups under the aegis of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES. ICES's advisory committee on fisheries management, ACFM reviews the reports of the various working groups and a composite report is subsequently presented to the European Community's scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries, STECF. The working group reports and the ACFM review inform the STECF's proposals to the European Commission on total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute represents Ireland in these scientific fora and I have consulted it in relation to the research work referred to by the Deputy. While the institute is not aware that this research has been specifically considered in analyses undertaken to date, I have been informed by the institute that there is some very limited evidence to suggest that the presence of ultra violet radiation may have a detrimental effect on the survival of eggs but this has not been substantiated.</P>
      <P>Assessment of cod stocks has shown that recruitment of young cod to the adult stock is highly variable. Although female cod may produce more than five or six million eggs, the survival rate is very low and depends on many factors, in particular water temperature, prevailing winds and currents and predation by other species.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there have been a number of poor cod recruitment classes in recent years, not just in the Irish Sea but in the North Sea and other areas also. A cod recovery plan is already in place for the Irish Sea and similar plans are now being developed for the North Sea and the west of Scotland. These plans recognise that the immediate priorities are, firstly, to assist the spawning process and, secondly, to protect juvenile cod through a variety of technical conservation measures. I believe that these measures will lead to an improvement in the status of cod stocks.</P>

    <P>The salaries of the staff in the communications unit who are seconded to this Department are paid by their parent Departments. This Department pays a shift allowance amounting to one sixth of salary which is paid on a recoupment basis in arrears in accordance as invoices are received. The unit is staffed from 6 a.m. until 11.30 p.m. on a three shift rota basis.</P>
    <P>The communications unit provides a comprehensive information service for Government Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments, and alerts them to any problems which may arise in relation to their implementation. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service for the public.</P>
    <P>The work of the communications unit reduces the need to use outside media monitoring services and for Departments to duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. While it is difficult to put an exact figure on the savings accruing to Government Departments because the cost of each transcript varies, depending on length and time, it is conservatively estimated that in a full year the communications unit would save Government Departments something in the region of £110,000 &ndash; £120,000 in total.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Ireland is proactive in seeking new business in Taiwan for Irish companies and we are concentrating primarily on the IT and software sectors. Enterprise Ireland uses the services of a consultancy in Taiwan to provide services for companies seeking assistance in Taiwan on a reactive basis. Enterprise Ireland's director, based in Singapore, makes regular visits to the area to support the local consultancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland has had a presence in Taiwan for over ten years through the office of International Trade Ireland located in the World Trade Centre, <Col N="248" /> Taipei. Despite ten years in this territory, limited opportunities have presented themselves in the form of Taiwanese investment in Ireland. However, in 1999, two projects were secured both of which are operating successfully in Ireland namely, Hon Hai located in Mullingar and Chai Cherne located in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    <P>The International Trade Ireland office in Taipei is currently staffed by a Taiwanese national and the IDA director in Asia Pacific based in Tokyo makes regular visits to Taiwan to support the local staff member. The IDA considers that the level of staff in the office is adequate at present to service the potential which the market offers.</P>

      <Quest> if, in regard to the national training fund, a decision has been made as to the way in which the training schemes will be funded and structured; the benefit which this training fund will provide for large multinational companies which cannot avail of the services of Enterprise Ireland, which is contributing to the fund; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national training fund will support a range of training schemes aimed at raising the skills for those in employment and providing skills to those who wish to take up employment. Training schemes currently operated by FÁS, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, IDA Ireland and the enterprise-led body, Skillnets, will be supported. The fund will be resourced through a levy on employers of 0.7% of the reckonable earnings of employees in class A and class H employments. Employers' PRSI contributions for these contribution classes were reduced by 0.7% on the introduction of the levy, to ensure that there would be no extra cost imposed on employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign-owned multinational companies fall under the remit of IDA Ireland and can potentially benefit from training grants provided by <Col N="249" /> that agency. In addition, a number of indigenous and foreign-owned multinational companies benefit directly from funding under the Skillnets' training networks programme.</P>
    <P>By providing skills for people who wish to enter or re-enter the workforce, the national training fund benefits all companies, large and small, by ensuring that the economy has a trained pool of labour to meet the needs of companies.</P>

Family friendly working arrangements are in the interests of employers, and employees because they contribute to the needs of the business as well as meeting the needs of employees with family responsibilities.</P>
      <P>For employers the benefits include: retention of skilled staff; reduced absenteeism; improved productivity; a more highly motivated workforce and also assist employers in being seen as an employer of choice. These are all very important factors for employers in the current tight labour market. Employees on the other hand benefit through having greater opportunities to better balance their working and family lives; greater equality of opportunity between men and women; and a fairer sharing of family responsibilities between men and women. A partnership approach in the workplace is the best way in which this issue should be addressed, in order to achieve tailor-made solutions to the benefit of the workforce and the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to support and facilitate family friendly policies in the workplace, the national framework committee for the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The committee comprises representatives of the ICTU, IBEC, public sector employers, the Equality Authority, a num<Col N="250" /> ber of Government Departments, and is chaired by my Department.</P>
    <P>The national framework committee has already undertaken a number of initiatives to raise awareness and provide information. The first Family Friendly Workplace Day, supported by the ICTU, IBEC and the Equality Authority, was held on 1 March. My colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, launched a new interactive website, www.familyfriendly.ie, and an information brochure entitled, An Introduction to Family Friendly Working Arrangements, on behalf of the national framework committee to coincide with Family Friendly Workplace Day.</P>
    <P>As part of the information and awareness campaign being undertaken by the committee, a series of follow-on actions are planned. There is a programme of four regional seminars scheduled from April to June in Dundalk, Galway, Waterford and Cork. It is hoped that Family Friendly Workplace Day and the regional seminars will be the springboard for a range of new initiatives at enterprise level.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, various family friendly statutory entitlements, including maternity leave, adoptive leave and parental leave. I am piloting two important Bills through the Oireachtas, the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has announced a review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>The work of the national framework committee, allied to a partnership approach in the workplace between employers, employees and trade unions and appropriate legislative measures, should achieve the goal of making workplaces family friendly. The work of the national framework committee has got off to a good start and, with the support of the social partners and the Equality Authority, I am confident that further progress will be achieved.</P>

      <Quest> the reasons the improvements contained in the Redundancy Payments (Lump Sum) Regulations, 2001, are applied to workers who receive notice after 1 April instead of workers whose employment actually terminates after this date; if her attention has been drawn to the discrepancy this creates for long-standing workers in view of the fact that they must be given a longer period of notice, and hence lose out relative to shorter-term workers where the termination date is in April; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that recent redundancies in a company (details supplied) are affected in such a manner; the plans she has to address this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ceiling on weekly wages for calculating the amount of a statutory redundancy lump sum payment was raised under Statutory Instrument 41 of 2001. This is the first increase in the ceiling in just over six years. The purpose of the statutory instrument is to raise the ceiling on annual reckonable earnings to be taken into account in the calculation of a statutory redundancy lump sum payment from £15,600, £300 per week to £20,800, £400 per week from 1 April 2001. The critical date for determining whether the higher ceiling should apply in any particular case is the date on which notification of proposed dismissal by reason of redundancy is issued, that is, the date the employee is declared redundant.</P>
      <P>Back in the early 1980s, the Department of Labour took the view that the higher ceiling should be applied from the date of termination of employment. However, this view was challenged in the High Court in the matter of The Minister for Labour (Plaintiff) <i>v</i> Nokia Limited and the Employment Appeals Tribunal (Defendants). In the <i>ex tempore</i> judgment delivered on 30 March 1983, the judge dismissed the Minister's appeal on the grounds that the lower ceiling should apply in the calculation of the statutory redundancy lump sum.</P>
      <P>This meant that the date an employee is declared redundant is the date on which a notice of proposed dismissal is given to the employee in accordance with section 17 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, that is, not later than two weeks before the date of dismissal.</P>
      <P>Any disputes arising in relation to redundancy can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which will make a decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>The European Union adopted the directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues in December last year. The purpose of the directive is to improve the availability and use of port reception facilities for such waste. It builds on existing international arrangements, principally MARPOL 73/78, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. While MARPOL deals with discharges at sea and with port reception facili<Col N="252" /> ties, the new directive is aimed primarily at port reception facilities.</P>

      <P>Regulations which were introduced in 1994 to give effect to the provisions of MARPOL included measures providing for the prevention of pollution by garbage from ships. Harbour authorities are obliged under these regulations to provide for the reception of garbage without causing undue delay from ships.

      <P>Ireland Aid began contributing to the UN population fund in 1993. This year's contribution of IR£1 million has now been paid. Contributions of IR£600,000, IR£400,000 and IR£369,000 were made in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, Ireland completed a three year term on the executive board of UNFPA. Through its membership of the board, Ireland was able to participate directly in detailed donor discussions on UNFPA's programmes and be in a position to closely monitor UNFPA's performance. We assumed our position on foot of the regular rotation of donor representatives.</P>
      <P>Ireland has now entered into a multi-annual funding arrangement with UNFPA as well as with the UN development programme, UNICEF, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Such an arrangement serves to confer a degree of financial predictability, thus enabling the agencies to plan future programmes and strategies. This facilitates effective aid management and helps the process of reform in the agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>In the context of the multi-annual funding arrangement, Ireland has given non-binding indicative commitments to UNFPA of IR£1.45 million and IR£2 million for 2002 and 2003, respectively.</P>

      <P>The only grant scheme in my Department that provides for grant-aid towards the cost of providing electricity supply is the farm electrification grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme is designed to subsidise the installation of electricity supply to farms which previously had no supply or where supply is inadequate, in order to facilitate the development and modernisation of farms in disadvantaged areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid, an applicant must practice farming on land, comprising of at least three hectares (7.5 acres) owned or held on long-term lease in a disadvantaged area. Farming must <Col N="258" /> also be the applicant's main occupation and principal source of income.</P>
    <P>Successful applicants qualify for 80% grant-aid for the first £2,000 of total costs to a maximum of £1,600. This is borne 20% by the Department and 60% by ESB. The balance more than £2,000 is borne by the applicant under standard terms from ESB, currently 50/50. Maximum grant-aid for 3-phase supply, where heavier current is required, is £3,200.</P>
    <P>Application forms, which outline the general rules and conditions of the scheme, are available from local ESB offices.</P>

      <P>The rate of pension paid under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming was expressed in ECUs. The revaluation of the Irish pound on the introduction of the euro in January 1999 resulted in a reduction of some 5.05% in the rate of pension. While the reduction in the rate is permanent, the Council of Ministers approved a three year scheme of compensation. Full compensation was paid in 2000 for reductions in payments during 1999. Compensation for reductions during 2000 is set at 75% and it will be paid to participants in the scheme later this month. Arrangements for the third and final compensation payment have yet to be determined.</P>

The applicant included a zero forage area on his arable area aid application and, as a consequence, was only entitled to a 15 livestock unit payment. To facilitate payment it was done manually. This payment totalling £2,254.25 issued to the person named in July 2000.</P>
      <P>Due to an oversight, the person named had been informed in February 2001 that payment in respect of the 25 animals would issue shortly whereas payment had already issued. The special beef premium unit has written to the person named clarifying the matter.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether it is appropriate that the Revenue Commissioners are still organising seminars throughout the country while many other events are being cancelled due to the foot and mouth crisis; and if he has satisfied himself that there is a consistent policy throughout the public service in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8342/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are participating actively, especially through Customs activities, in the national efforts to prevent the disease from coming into this country. In addition, the commissioners are taking all the precautions recommended by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Instructions were immediately issued to all local managers in relation to these recommended precautions. Compliance and audit visits to farms and to premises supplying farm inputs were suspended. All non-essential internal meetings and training courses were also suspended. The Revenue board conveyed to all its managers the Government decision that non-essential events involving the bringing together of people from farming communities or from infected areas should be cancelled. This instruction was followed throughout Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only in one area did the instructions pose a problem for Revenue in relation to defining <Col N="270" /> whether events were or were not essential. The PAYE system to be operated by employers from April 2001 is radically different from previous years. It involves the introduction of tax credits rather than tax free allowances and the introduction of a nine month tax year &ndash; all in all the most fundamental change in the system since its introduction in 1960. There is considerable potential for confusion for employers attempting to operate PAYE for their employees in such a fundamentally different way. A substantial investment had been made by Revenue in a video to assist employers in the operation of the new procedures, but the assessment of the situation on the ground was that employers also needed hands-on guidance if very significant problems were not to emerge. Seminars for businesses for this purpose, which had been arranged for some time, were allowed to proceed except in certain Border areas where it was considered there was a particular potential risk.</P>
    <P>Seminars have yet to take place in a number of other venues, including Wexford, where seminars were postponed following discussions locally. These seminars are now being rescheduled. Revenue is satisfied that, while being essential, these seminars will be category one events as defined in the recommendations of the expert group in relation to foot and mouth disease controls published on 14 March. Category one events include gatherings of people in defined locations with no access to agricultural land or susceptible live<Col N="271" /> stock. Provided routine disinfection procedures are adhered to, these events carry a minimal risk of virus spread and should be allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>With regard to consistency of policy throughout the public service, there is a high level committee which meets under the chairmanship of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which seeks to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the foot and mouth crisis is taken across the public service. My Department complies with any policy guidelines issued by that committee.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service Commission holds competitions at clerical officer level several times throughout the year as part of the ongoing recruitment policy. Confined competitions for the establishment of temporary clerical officers have also been held on occasion as part of this policy. It is hoped to hold the next such establishment competition in June or July of 2001. Temporary clerical officers are, however, free to apply for other open competitions for positions as clerical officer when they arise. The next open clerical officer competition is expected to be advertised by late summer 2001.</P>

      <P>When identifying property for acquisition as community residences, health boards give due consideration to the location of the premises and to the level of services available, such as public transport, shops, employment and social facilities, to ensure the location offers the maximum opportunity for social integration into the local community. Where access to these services is not readily available, a minibus may be provided to transport patients to the local amenities.</P>

      <P>At 8.20 a.m. on Tuesday, 27 February 2001, the ESB electricity supply failed at St. Ita's Hospital due to bad weather conditions in the north Dublin area and the back-up generator at the hospital immediately went into operation. The following morning, Wednesday, 28 February, the back-up generator failed and could not be restarted. A new generator was hired and the power supply was restored by 4.05 p.m. that day. The ESB power supply was finally restored at 7.00 p.m. on Thursday, 1 March 2001.</P>
      <P>During the course of the power failure, emergency measures were taken to secure the safety and comfort of residents and patients. Additional food was distributed and gas heaters and gas rings were supplied to wards, along with additional blankets. My Department was notified of the situation on Wednesday, 28 February, and immediately contacted the Department of Defence requesting army assistance. The Army Catering Corps was deployed and arrived at the campus at 4.10 p.m. that day and provided an emergency catering service. Hot meals were provided to all patients by 5.30 p.m. that evening.</P>
      <P>Tender documentation was being prepared prior to this incident to replace the emergency generator at St. Ita's with a full capacity generator. Arrangements are being made to expedite this matter and, in the interim, the full capacity generator installed on Wednesday, 28 February, will remain on hire.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the Northern Area Board has asked the ESB to give the highest priority to maintaining the supply to St. Ita's campus in the event of a similar occurrence. A review of all emergency power supply arrangements at major residential premises within the board's area is also being undertaken.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the shared ownership scheme, the local authority's equity interest, on which the applicant's rent is calculated, is updated in line with inflation on 1 July each year. Where a shared owner wishes to acquire all or part of this equity, the cost of purchase is determined on the basis of the original cost of the equity updated in line with inflation to its current value at the time of purchase. I have no proposals to ask Dublin Corporation to change its procedures in this regard.</P>

      <P>There are no funds available to me to provide grants for individuals to repair damage to properties caused by flooding. In terms of repairing long-term damage to housing, there are a number of targeted options currently available to assist vulnerable groups, such as lower income households and elderly persons, to secure necessary improvements works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the essential repairs grants scheme, the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly. The resources for these schemes have been substantially increased in recent years. They are operated in the Kildare area by Kildare County Council and the Eastern Regional Health Authority's South Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a range of grant schemes which offer support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and in the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs. Community groups seeking funding under the various grant schemes operated by my Department are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing applications received under the various schemes, my Department must establish the extent to which groups, and the particular project for which funding is sought, address such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands. I confirm that the southern regional office of my Department has received an application under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations from the community group referred to by the <Col N="280" /> Deputy. As a large number of applications have been received and will take time to process, it is not possible to indicate at this stage if funding can be allocated to this group under this year's scheme. My Department will notify the group, in due course, of the outcome of its application.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 1997. Following a recent examination by a medical assessor of my Department he was considered to be capable of work. A deciding officer consequently decided that he is not entitled to payment of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>In determining whether a person is incapable of work for disability benefit purposes account is taken initially of whether the person is fit for their usual work. In reviewing continuing entitlement the person's fitness for other categories of work that they might reasonably be expected to carry out, having regard to their medical condition, would be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Following the recent examination the medical assessor expressed the view that, while the person concerned could not perform his usual work, there is a range of other types of work in which he could become involved. The person concerned has engaged in work over the course of his claim, having on two occasions been granted the necessary exemptions from the rules of behaviour of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Deputy's concern in the matter, however, the case is being referred for an appeal.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that responses to the issue of domestic violence falls within the remit of a number of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is responsible for the provision of services to victims, including the provision of funding, through the relevant health boards, to the non-governmental organisations dealing with victims; the Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for the provision of crisis accommodation; the Department of Education and Science is responsible for educating children in relation to the issue in schools; the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs funds community development pro<Col N="288" /> grammes and also grant aids local groups dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>My Department's responsibility relates to measures dealing with perpetrators, including the establishment of perpetrator programmes.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State, was appointed by the Government to chair the national steering committee on violence against women. It was in this context that she met Amen to discuss issues in relation to male victims of domestic violence. At that meeting the issues raised by the Amen representatives related to matters which are the responsibility of other Ministers, as I have outlined above, or were matters for the courts, who are, in accordance with the terms of the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that research has been commissioned, at the instigation of my colleague, Deputy Martin, Minister for Health and Children, by the North Eastern Health Board in relation to male victims of domestic violence so that a service response can be identified. I await the publication of the results of this research.</P>
    <P>In relation to recent newspaper articles about the prevalence of male victims of domestic violence, I am conscious that victims can be both male and female. The Garda annual statistics show that, in recorded cases, 89% of the victims were female and 11% male. The issue of male victimisation is serious even though it appears to be less prevalent than female victimisation.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the Juries Act, 1976 for the payment of expenses to jurors from State funds. When the Act was introduced, consideration was given to the matter of expenses but it was decided that expenses should not be paid as performance of jury service was considered to be a basic civic duty which arose relatively infrequently as far as the individual is concerned.</P>
      <P>Section 29 of the Act of 1976 makes provision for employees to be paid by their employers while on jury service.</P>
      <P>Under section 9 of the Act of 1976, a county registrar may excuse any person whom he or she has summoned as a juror from attendance during the whole or any part of the sittings in question if that person shows to the county registrar's satisfaction that there is good reason he or she should be so excused. This is entirely a matter for the county registrar concerned and I have no function in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Government is conscious of the need to provide proper infrastructure for Sports Campus Ireland and, importantly, for the greater Blanchardstown area in west Dublin and is anxious that the development of Sports Campus Ireland should be a catalyst to finding an acceptable solution to the transport problems in the area. To that end the Government has set up a specialist high level group to look at the public transport needs of the campus and Blanchardstown in terms of a metro link from Dublin Airport and the city centre; developing the rail infrastructure on the Maynooth line, which passes close to the campus and can provide access from the west and the city centre; enhancing bus links and quality bus corridors, and access to the complex by improving road alignments with the M50.</P>
      <P>As plans are developed, the high level group will undertake a full consultation process with the local communities. I understand that the chairman of the group has written to the chairperson of Dublin 15 Community Council asking for its participation in the process. I also understand that CSID too is in discussions with the local community with regard to the impact of the development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school-community liaison service. There are no immediate plans to expand the home-school-community liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that last January I launched a major new programme to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. The school in question did not rank sufficiently high in terms of the level of disadvantage in the school to receive additional teaching resources. However, the school is included in the rural dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £1,637 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>I note that the school has arranged a meeting with the inspector to discuss its request for additional staff and my Department will request a report from the inspector following that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140, 145, 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>I consider that the Blackstock Report represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment by establishing the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by my Department that supports the school development planning process. This <Col N="295" /> process can only be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the standard per capita grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional per capita grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the administration and management of vocational education colleges is a function of vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>Guidelines issued by my Department provide for the establishment by vocational education committees of boards of management for schools in their schemes. The guidelines provide that boards should be comprised of four members of the vocational education committee and two parents, one of whom shall be a mother, of children receiving education in the school.</P>
      <P>In relation to selection boards, the agreed selection procedures for the appointment and promotion of teachers in vocational schools specify that there shall be gender representation and in the case of five person boards every effort should be made to have at least two of each gender on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> The Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill 2000, which is before the House, aims to ensure membership of vocational education committees is representative of local authorities, parents, VEC staff and other local interests. The issues that arise in this context, including the issue of gender balance, are complex and call for careful consideration. While in practical terms this is a matter that should be best addressed at local level, it will be open to the Minister, in consultation with appropriate interests, to make regulations providing for members of both sexes to be appointed where gender balance is not being addressed.</P>

      <P>Pupils affected by specific learning difficulties by the time they are preparing for State examinations may be given special consideration by my Department in relation to the junior and leaving certificates.

      <P>There are currently 5,000 approved places for the vocational training opportunities scheme. The courses are full time and can last up to two years. The VTOS programme was designed for long-term unemployed people who have minimal or no qualifications. Tuition, books and materials are free, and participants are paid an allowance in lieu of welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>While demand for VTOS places at present exceeds supply, it is a matter of some concern that it has not attracted many older, longer-term unemployed people. In an effort to address this, a study has been commissioned by my Department to identify and report on the outreach, recruitment, delivery and support strategies which would be likely to attract older longer-term unemployed people, that is people who are over 35 years of age and have been on the live register for over six months, of whom there were 69,000 in April 1999. Pending experience of the effectiveness of these strategies, there are no plans at present to alter the VTOS eligibility criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to education initiative as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo; will provide for part-time <Col N="300" /> options across the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach, and post leaving certificate programmes aimed at young people, adults and those in employment. The intention is that this new initiative will address the increase in demand for places, and provide flexibility in provision of programmes to meet the demands of adults wishing to return to education and training. Under the programme, tuition will be free for holders of medical cards, unemployment payments, means tested welfare payments or family income supplement, but the continuation of a welfare payment will be subject to the discretion of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. There will be a reduced fee for other unwaged people with less than upper second level education, and the remaining participants will be charged fees.</P>
