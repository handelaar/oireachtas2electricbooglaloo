    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I travelled to Scotland on 20 June for a one day official visit, which included engagements in both Edinburgh and Glasgow. During the visit I met the First Minister, Henry McLeish, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Helen Liddel, as well as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, John Reid.</P>
      <P>I had the honour of being among the first non-Scots to address the Scottish Parliament. My address to the session with a very full attendance of Members and the public focused on the rich history of cultural and social links between Ireland and Scotland and the opportunities now emerging significantly to enhance our relationship in the context of devolution and the institutional arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Glasgow I gave a keynote address at the economic seminar, &ldquo;Ireland and Scotland: Busi<Col N="35" /> ness Partners in the 21st Century&rdquo;, which highlighted the trade links between the two countries and showcased a number of successful businesses working in both markets. This seminar, which was attended by about 400 business people, was also addressed by the First Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland. In my address I stressed that while we greatly value the historical links between the two countries, our primary focus is on building the relationship between today's Ireland and today's Scotland.</P>
    <P>After this event the deputy chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sir Angus Grossart, announced the repatriation to Ireland of a major painting of Daniel O'Connell by the renowned Scottish artist, David Wilkie. Earlier in the day I opened a new branch of the Bank of Ireland in Edinburgh at a function which was also addressed by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>Later in the afternoon I unveiled a memorial in Carfin dedicated to the remembrance of all those forced to leave Ireland during the Great Famine. On the way to Carfin I called in at the offices of the archdiocese of Glasgow to pay my respects to the late Cardinal Winning who was lying in state there. The ceremony at Carfin was attended by a wide range of political leaders and representatives in Scotland and by church leaders, including a representative of the Church of Scotland. His expressions of regret at the reception in Scotland sometimes afforded to Irish immigrants of the famine era and also at later sectarianism were appreciated by those present, including a large number of the public of Irish descent. The event at Carfin was followed by a civic reception in Motherwell hosted by the North Lanarkshire Council.</P>
    <P>The visit proved successful. In the light of the discussions which took place during my visit I look forward to a significant strengthening of the relationship between Ireland and Scotland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Ireland is now represented diplomatically in Edinburgh to what extent is it the policy of the Government to pursue a separate foreign policy with the devolved administration in Scotland? How is this policy delineated by our traditional links with the United Kingdom? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past few years since devolution our consulates in Cardiff and Edinburgh are dealing on a day-to-day basis with both the Assembly and the Parliament. That gives us a new opportunity in both Scotland and Wales which we did not have previously. As regards foreign policy issues, we still look to Westminster, but deal exclusively with the areas within the devolved powers. As regards business and education issues and social and economic policy, the focus is now back on Scotland and Wales and that is working well. It does not create difficulties. If we moved on foreign policy issues, that would be seen in a different light. As the Deputy knows, I <Col N="36" /> was in Wales on St. David's Day and in Scotland on 20 June. The view of Westminster is that it is happy with the devolution arrangements. However, foreign policy issues are still dealt with by No. 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is telling the House that the Government is not pursuing a separate foreign policy initiative in respect of the devolved Assemblies in Scotland and Wales and that foreign policy is being conducted exclusively through London for the whole of the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because it is not a devolved function and, therefore, not something within the remit of either area. That is the way they wish it to operate. It does not create any difficulties. Both the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament are anxious that we build and operate new relationships. The Secretaries of State take a close interest in any visits and interaction between us and them. While I am pointing out the functional basis, it does not create a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reported that at his meeting with the Scottish First Minister, Mr. McLeish, the Taoiseach expressed support for a joint bid between Ireland and Scotland for the European soccer championships in 2012, but that this was contingent on the provision of a national stadium here. Is this still the Taoiseach's position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this. First, the Scottish Football Association is bidding on its own and if it succeeds in convincing UEFA of the merits of that bid, the joint bid would not arise. The SFA is still pursuing that bid, which is for 2008, but if it does not succeed then the association would be interested in pursuing a joint bid with Ireland. Second, I would certainly be in favour of that but in present circumstances we could not host such a tournament. Unfortunately, the Football Association of Ireland does not have a ground that can hold any more than 15,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the second part of my supplementary question, is it the Taoiseach's intention to go ahead with the national stadium?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the Taoiseach's visit to Scotland, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, but in his conversation with the Scottish First Minister, the Taoiseach agreed to put forward a joint proposal with Scotland to host the European soccer championships in 2012. The Taoiseach went on to say this would only be possible if we had the national stadium facilities. Therefore, it is absolutely in order for me to ask whether it is still the Taoiseach's position that the national stadium&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order. It is a separate question. In his reply, the Taoiseach just made a passing reference to that. That does not give rise to a direct supplementary question relating to a matter that is not near the central matter of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In his discussions with Mr.</P>
      <P>McLeish, the Taoiseach was aware that we did not have, at present, the facilities to host such a championship. Is he confident we will have the facilities by 2012?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Progress on the Government programme is kept constantly under review. Deputy Noonan will be aware that we recently published the fourth annual progress report. The action programme and its mid-term review contains 535 specific commitments and today, over four years after the last general election, some three-quarters plus of the objectives and action points have been achieved, and significant progress has been achieved on others.</P>
      <P>In implementing our commitments, we have brought forward and progressed one of the most ambitious legislative programmes in the history of the State. Since this Government took office on 26 June 1997, an unprecedented 179 Bills have been enacted. In addition, there are currently 45 Bills before the Oireachtas. Given the scale of the Government's legislative programme and the large number of specific commitments set out in the action programme, it would be impossible, in the time allotted, to fully detail the immense amount of progress we have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cornerstones of our action programme are based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone, and our core promises at the last election to cut unemployment, taxes and crime, and <Col N="38" /> to work to build a lasting peace on this island. We have delivered spectacularly on all of these.</P>
    <P>We said we would cut unemployment and we have. No Government has done more in addressing one of the major sources of disadvantage in our country, that of joblessness. We have been responsible for the implementation of policies which have led to the creation of more than 310,000 jobs, a dramatic reduction in unemployment from 10.7% to 3.6% and of long-term unemployment from 4.6% to 1.2%. We have brought about the lowest rate of unemployment since records began. We have put an end to forced emigration. Going forward, we will continue to implement policies to make certain that every unemployed person is offered full opportunity and support to get back to work in their own locality.</P>
    <P>We said we would cut crime and we have. Figures have fallen by an unprecedented 25% since the Government took office. Alongside the drop in crime, the detection rate for recorded crime has increased significantly over our period in office. Ireland now has a detection rate of 42% compared to 21% in the United States and 26% in the United Kingdom. This is quite simply because the Government as promised, had given the Garda Síochána the resources to police our streets, waterways and airspace as never before. The Garda Vote has increased by 48% since the Government took office and by 2002 we will have increased the number of gardaí by 1,200. Over 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided in our prisons building programme. We have ended the revolving door syndrome in our prisons and invested unprecedented funding in crime prevention measures. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has introduced 41 new Bills, more than any predecessor.</P>
    <P>We promised to cut taxes and have done so. We introduced large tax cuts in each budget which have meant real increases in take home pay for all sections of the labour force. We have reduced the standard rate of tax from 26% to 20%, delivering on our pledge one year early. We have reduced the higher rate of tax from 48% to 42%. In total, we have cut tax rates by 12 points. The last Government merely cut the standard rate by only one point. We have provided over £3.2 billion in personal tax reductions &ndash; over £2 billion more than the last Government. A total of 38% of all income earners &ndash; 668,000 people &ndash; are now exempt from tax. We have also ensured that over 80% of the national minimum wage is now entirely free of tax. Today only 23% of taxpayers &ndash; 402,000 people &ndash; are paying tax at the higher rate. Our commitment is to ensure that 80% of taxpayers are paying at the standard rate and we are well on track to deliver on this objective.</P>
    <P>We said we would restore peace and have done so. Within weeks of our return to power the IRA announced another ceasefire. The Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent referenda clearly demonstrated that the people of this island <Col N="39" /> wanted their politicians to put in place and operate structures set out in the Agreement which were based on equality, tolerance, mutual respect and a desire to see a divided society, which for so long has been ravaged from within, reach its full potential. Most aspects of the Agreement have been implemented. On 2 December 1999 the institutions under the Agreement were established and the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, enshrining, in particular, the principle of consent, took effect.</P>
    <P>The Government is continuing to work closely with the British Government and all political parties in Northern Ireland to secure the implementation of outstanding aspects of the Agreement &ndash; an agreed new beginning on policing, demilitarisation, decommissioning and the inclusive operation of the institutions.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the record of my Government in setting out an ambitious programme, earning the support of the electorate and implementing its promises in office. Over the course of the next nine months we will complete this work and be in a position to present to the people an unprecedented record of delivery and achievement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach embarrassed that a Government in its fifth year in office, after a period of unprecedented prosperity, is presiding over shambolic public services? Is he embarrassed that the health service is in a chaotic state and that one in six children leave the education system functionally illiterate? Is he embarrassed that secondary school education is again threatened this autumn because of the incompetence of his Minister for Education and Science?</P>
      <P>Is he further embarrassed that we have unprecedented public housing lists and that young couples can no longer afford to buy their own homes? Is he embarrassed that, after four years in office, traffic in Dublin can scarcely move, that quality of life has been diminished to an unprecedented degree and that he has failed to give leadership in those areas about which the public is most concerned? Is he embarrassed that, by and large, his Ministers are incompetent managers who cannot deliver in those areas which are strictly within the competence of Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Government has a spectacular record and will continue to deal with the issues, including some of those raised by the Deputy. He will appreciate that some of these areas were left in an atrocious mess by him and others, but that we have continued to improve on them as we move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have continued to increase the number of houses being built and, where necessary, introduce new incentives to try to maintain confidence in the industry. I referred to crime. We have provided for record investment in education for which funding has increased by 70%. Direct funding for primary schools is up by two thirds. A total of 2,500 new teachers have been hired &ndash; a <Col N="40" /> situation which we turned around from a cut in teacher numbers. We have invested £800 million in the modernisation of schools.</P>
    <P>I referred to the issue of jobs. There are a large number of initiatives to deal with social inclusion. The national development plan provides £15 billion for the largest social inclusion package in the history of the State which will be spent across a range of areas.</P>
    <P>There have been dramatic increases in child benefit which will provide up to £90 per week for each child after the three year period set out in the last budget. There has been significant investment in disadvantaged areas under programmes such as RAPID and CLÁR, as there has been in old age pensions and other areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned transport where £1 billion was spent on railways, £200 million on Dublin bus services and £86 million on Bus Éireann. We have invested £2.2 billion in public transport.</P>
    <P>All these programmes have commenced. There is much more to do and we will continue to do it. Health funding has doubled and soon there will be a national strategy on health. We continue to modernise and build on that service. I disagree with Deputy Noonan that any of my Ministers is incompetent. They are superb, hard working individuals who serve the country well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy expect me to answer that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, had a bad day when he displayed incredible incompetence. Would he regard the Minister for Health and Children as being incompetent on the basis, as he stated, that while funding for health has doubled, the waiting list crisis has not yet been resolved? Is that the result of a bad day? Does he regard the implementation of the three Bacon reports on housing, which resulted in a crisis in local authority housing, private sector output and the private rented sector, as a bad day, bad month or bad four years?</P>

    <P>There are problems in the health service and I am sure that in 100 years time there will still be problems. The waiting list accounts for 3% of overall health service activity. There have been an extra 90,000 procedures. There is higher through-put, better services, more doctors, <Col N="41" /> nurses, paramedics, theatres and hospital buildings. Of course, there are still problems. Anyone being on a waiting list for a long time is a problem, but we continue to tackle it. We are addressing problems in accident and emergency departments, some of which have been dealt with already. In the health strategy and the capital programme, we look forward and there are resources in the national development plan. Building is taking place at many hospitals and services are being improved. We must continue to deal with these problems. To the best of our ability, we seek a state-of-the-art health service. As the Tánaiste stated last week, patients, whether private or public, should receive equity of treatment. That is what we are trying to achieve. We are not there yet, but continue to work towards it by providing resources.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach outlined the moneys spent by his Ministers. I have no quarrel with him that his Ministers are well able to spend money. Public expenditure this year has risen by 24%. The issue is that, despite the expenditure, the State's public services are a disaster. They are worse than when he took office four years ago. He threw money at problems with no structural reform, and the people are not getting the services for which their taxes pay. That is a frightful indictment of this Government in its fifth year of office.</P>

Is he not embarrassed, in particular, on issues such as the care of the elderly and disabled, that our parents and grandparents, on whose shoulders and backs our current prosperity was built, have not been paid the debt that we owe them in terms of proper care? Is he not embarrassed that across the areas where the Cabinet is most responsible, the delivery of public services is worse than when he entered office five years ago, except that the budget has been quadrupled.</P>

      <P>I accept there is a waiting list. I accept there are still difficulties but I do not accept that the health service is as bad as it was four years ago. It has dramatically improved. There are still difficulties and I have highlighted the accident and emergency area, but there are now 90,000 more patients being treated than there was last year. Only 4% of the total activity of hospitals is linked to waiting lists. There are better facilities. The national cancer strategy has worked extremely well. The extension of cardiac surgery facilities to Galway and Cork has halved the numbers on the cardiac surgery waiting lists. What is being done for people with disabilities and what is being done in the area of mental health is far more than we have ever done before. That money is being well spent but the reality is that there is a great deal to be done. We are trying to catch up with decades and decades of underfunding and we must continue to do that.</P>

      <P>When the Government was formed and its programme was published, the key priority itemised under health was that the Government would tackle the crisis in the hospital waiting lists. Will the Taoiseach accept that the most recent figures show that far from tackling the hospital waiting lists and despite the money that the Government has put into the system the Government is now responsible for an increase in the numbers of people on the hospital waiting lists? </P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that these people are not simply statistics? They are real people in suffering and in pain who are entitled to get access to medical care and are being denied that access because of the perpetuation of a two-tier system? Will he accept that, were they private patients, they would be able to access the care they need and the essential services such as hip replacement operations, cardiac operations, eye cataract operations, grommets in children's ears and so on?</P>
      <P>Will he accept that it is an indictment of this Government that having presided over the greatest economic prosperity &ndash; unprecedented economic prosperity &ndash; it has thrown away the opportunity to deal with the crisis in our hospital service and to provide a fair and excellent system to all our citizens? Has it reached the point where even his partners in Government have given up on him and are trying to come up with &ldquo;Elastoplast&rdquo; options to deal with what is a serious issue facing thousands upon thousands of sick and elderly people who deserve better at a time when this country is rich and could provide for them?</P>

The reality is that the efforts of hospital staff and health boards are devoted to doing the utmost to improve the health service. They are succeeding in most respects but there are clearly some areas such as accident and emergency where there are still difficulties. There are other long-term issues.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of £1 billion, it is a question of £2.6 billion and a further £2 billion under the national development plan. The Minister for Finance wanted to ensure the tightening up of matters, that whatever additional resources were allocated to the Health budget were used as efficiently and effectively as possible to make a greater impact. That is the prudent thing to do. The Minister for Finance, in line with any Minister for Finance, wants to make sure that the resources put into the health services get to the areas where there are difficulties. The 4% of health activity linked to the waiting lists and accident and emergency services are the issues to <Col N="44" /> which the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance continue to address their concerns.

      <P>A distortion was created in the market because incentives for investors were too great. In some estates investors were able to buy almost the entire supply of houses. This happened in Deputy Quinn's constituency and in my own. People from various parts of the country bought houses as part of a tax package while those who lived in the local community could only look on.</P>
      <P>There is now a difficulty in the rental sector. This must be dealt with in a way which does not distort the market for the first time buyer. I agree that a mechanism must be found for this but it must not be done at the expense of first time buyers.</P>
      <P>In recent years the percentage of houses being bought by first time buyers was falling below</P>
      <P>37%. We have succeeded in bringing that figure back to 43%. We must continue to do this. Otherwise housing estates and apartment blocks will be populated by transient tenants. This has a bad effect on communities and is the wrong thing to do.</P>

        <b>: </b>Has the Government not allowed speculators, particularly those who control building land, and developers to run riot and to charge any price they wanted while the Government has sat on its hands? Is it not a big problem that Deputies from the Taoiseach's party have been named in tribunals as facilitators of speculators? It is said that such Deputies are <Col N="49" /> in the pay of speculators and that they facilitate land speculation.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the provision of local authority housing. Between 40,000 and 50,000 families are on local authority housing waiting lists. Horrific overcrowding results in many cases which, in turn, leads to mental anguish and terrific deprivation. What kind of dent can the Government's programme make on such a huge number? What hope can be offered to the tens of thousands on the housing waiting list, who want to see light at the end of the tunnel and hope to own a home within a reasonable period of time? Does the Taoiseach agree that the Government's provision in the national development plan is totally insufficient in that regard?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct to say that the figures in the national development plan, 5,000 houses over three years, will not solve all problems. The most important thing is that the houses are built as quickly as possible. Local authority housing areas had great difficulties last year in spending the resources they were allocated, but this year has been more successful in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 93 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>These questions arise in the aftermath of the evil attacks on the people of the United States. This House has already made clear its abhorrence of what occurred. I thank the Deputies who asked these questions for allowing me to outline developments in so far as my areas of responsibility are concerned.</P>
      <P>The threat of major terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The Garda Síochána has maintained and is fostering mutual assistance and co-operation with police forces and security services worldwide to ensure an effective flow of relevant intelligence. There has been a heightened state of security awareness at vital strategic locations since the tragic events of 11 September. Deputies will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to comment on the specifics of such arrangements.</P>
      <P>For a number of years the Garda Síochána has maintained surveillance on a number of non-nationals whose activities were considered to warrant it. The surveillance will continue, but Deputies will appreciate that I cannot appropriately say anything further about the matter. The Garda is assisting in worldwide investigations into the recent atrocities in the United States, but it would not be prudent to comment on specific aspects of the assistance.</P>
      <P>The EU Justice and Home Affairs Council met on Thursday, 20 September 2001 to consider the measures necessary if we are to maintain a high level of security and combat terrorism. It decided to harness all the EU measures that have already been adopted, such the 1995 and 1996 conventions on extradition between member states, Europol and Eurojust, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000 and to set up an EU task force for police chiefs. The seriousness of recent events has led to an acceleration of the process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice and the stepping up of co-operation with partners, especially the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council adopted over 40 measures to help <Col N="51" /> fight terrorism within the European Union and improve co-operation with the United States. I will mention some of the principal ones. Two Commission proposals for framework decisions are to be thoroughly examined, the first on the approximation of member states' criminal laws with a view to establishing a common definition of a terrorist act and laying down common criminal sanctions and the second on the creation of a European arrest warrant; the early ratification of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal matters between member states of the European Union; Pro-Eurojust to bring together member states' magistrates specialising in counter-terrorism to examine the co-ordination of terrorism investigations; the Police Chiefs Task Force to discuss improved operational co-operation between member states and third countries and to co-ordinate measures implemented in member states to guarantee security, including in the field of air safety; Europol to analyse and report on the terrorist threat; the early ratification by member states of the relevant conventions to prevent and combat the financing of terrorism; the strengthening of border controls; and increased co-operation and closer consultations with the United States in all competent international fora and especially a more active role for the Union within the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In a separate but closely related development, the Security Council of the United Nations has adopted a wide-ranging, comprehensive resolution obliging member states to take steps and implement strategies to combat international terrorism, especially in relation to the financing or support of terrorism.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures raise difficult and complex issues and will require careful albeit urgent scrutiny. Examination of the various proposals has commenced both at home and in the EU institutions. Regarding one of the measures, the early ratification by member states of the relevant conventions to prevent and combat the financing of terrorism, the Government yesterday approved the signature by Ireland of the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. A number of the proposals will inevitably require legislation and as soon as the measures are finalised I will bring proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures arising at an international level I am also reviewing our domestic law to see whether any changes may be necessary in the light of the events which have taken place.</P>
    <P>While the Garda Síochána have a role to play in dealing with national emergencies, the issue of facilities and equipment to cope with chemical or biological attacks is a matter for a number of agencies.</P>

      <P>The shocking events of 11 September clearly require an urgent, comprehensive and measured response. In so far as my areas of responsibility are concerned I hope I have been able to demonstrate to the House that that response is well under way.</P>

      <P>Do the Garda have appropriate equipment available to them to enable them to function and to protect themselves should there be a chemical or biological attack perpetrated by terrorists in this country? What contact has the Minister had with the relevant airport authorities to ensure that adequate security is in place in our airports to ensure that a plane leaving our shores is not used as a form of missile to perpetrate the type of atrocity we saw in the United States? Does the Minister have any concerns that a reporter from TV3 managed to get through the security systems in Dublin Airport yesterday while retaining in her possession instruments of the type that were used to take over aircraft in the United States? What action has the Minister taken to ensure that that difficulty is addressed?</P>

      <P>Measures are being taken to update the major emergency plan and a review of the plans is under way at present to see how they should be updated to take account of the present threat. The major emergency plan itself is the framework for the immediate response by the emergency services &ndash; the Garda, health and fire services and so on &ndash; to any major incident.</P>
      <P>Coping with chemical spills or releases has always been a feature of the major emergency framework plan but that was in a peace time context. What is now being addressed is how the framework can be adopted to facilitate the best response by the emergency services to an incident resulting from the use of CBWs. It is important to state that the security advice available to me at present is that there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a target for such attacks. Nonetheless, I accept the need to take precautions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the issue of airports, the Deputy will <Col N="53" /> be well aware that airports have airport police and that there is also a Garda presence at airports. Every possible reasonable effort is made to try and ensure that the risk to passengers is minimised if not completely eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the specific questions I tabled, I asked specifically what equipment is available to the Garda in the event of a chemical or biological attack and the Minister said that is a matter to be debated by some committee. The Minister will agree we have had enough obfuscation on these matters. Is there equipment available or not? A simple, clear answer to that would be welcome. Does the Minister agree that while we may not be subject to direct attack we may be subject to the fall-out from an attack in the neighbouring jurisdiction? That point was real enough to be put by the Taoiseach to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, in a private discussion that was made public last week.</P>
      <P>Also, in relation to the arrangements that were decided and fast-tracked at the Justice Ministers' Council in Brussels, the Minister has indicated that some 40 measures were involved. When will these measures be put to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights? Can we have details of these before there is any agreement on behalf of Ireland, as the assent of the Oireachtas to these matters is surely important? Does the Minister agree with the cautionary tone of the Attorney General, who suggested that the Minister move on these matters with caution? This jurisdiction is based on a Constitution which enumerates the rights of the citizen and there are substantial differences in the administration of law between this jurisdiction and others, even within the European Union.</P>
      <P>In relation to the seizure of assets, will the Criminal Assets Bureau be involved in supporting the seizure of assets of terrorist groups, either those directly connected with the appalling atrocity in the United States or other, domestic terrorist groups? Will the full force of the CAB and other organs of the Garda be brought to bear on all terrorist activity to cut off funding once and for all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this tranche of questions, in relation to the structure for shared intelligence that is to be established under the agreements made by the <Col N="54" /> Council of Ministers, what is the nature of that structure? How will Ireland be involved in it?</P>

      <P>The attacks on the United States have clearly changed the context in which emergency planning must take place. Nobody looking at the question objectively would believe it is within the powers of the Garda alone to take action in the event of a nuclear attack. That is obviously something that would have to be co-ordinated among the various security interests in the State. The same goes for the equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the measures proposed and agreed between European Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, we have a written Constitution and I have at all times stated that certain difficulties could arise in regard to the legislative implementation of some of the measures concerned. For example, the issue of investigative detention in regard to which some EU member states can hold individuals for long periods, must come under scrutiny. The rule whereby a person extradited from this State for an offence in another state must be assured that the offence in question is also an offence in this State must also be examined in the context of the European arrest warrant.</P>
      <P>I detected a determination among the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers to accommodate differences in so far as that could be achieved. I explained to those present that constitutional difficulties could and would arise in regard to some of the measures proposed, but I am confident that the meeting's accommodating atmosphere will result in our constitutional concerns being met. It is anticipated that the proposals will be progressed and that the matter will be further advanced at the December meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers when it is hoped to make significant political progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Ireland's role in the implementation of new measures, it was agreed that police chiefs throughout the European Union would meet to discuss the issue of co-operation. It was also agreed that Europol's role would be enhanced and that a task force to deal with terrorism would be established on a renewable basis. In this con<Col N="55" /> text, it was also agreed that there would be a greater level of co-operation and consultation with the United States.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau in this jurisdiction is empowered to freeze and dispose of illicit assets where a court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the assets are illegal. Moreover, the criminal justice legislation of 1994, a substantial piece of legislation, deals with money laundering. We have also agreed to the ratification of the convention on the financing of terrorism. I understand the British Home Secretary today announced that further measures may be required in British law and if such measures, either in Britain or any other EU country, would assist in the freezing or seizing of terrorists' assets, I would not be slow to introduce such measures here. I feel sure I would have the support of the House to do so. The Central Bank has already issued various Irish financial institutions with a list of names provided by US authorities and the institutions have been asked to report to the authorities if any of the people concerned, who are believed to be associated with this dreadful atrocity, appear on their customer lists.</P>

      <P>Ireland has a substantial body of anti-terrorism legislation on its Statute Book dating back to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I cannot go into detail about any individual under investigation by the Garda Síochána in this jurisdiction. However, I assure Members that if there are individuals moving about throughout the country who come under international or domestic suspicion, the Garda carries out its functions dutifully in that regard. Not a scintilla of evidence has been made available to me which suggests that anybody in this jurisdiction had any link to the atrocity which occurred in the United States on 11 September. We are co-operating with the international community and, in particular, the United States to combat terrorism and will continue to do so. The impression should not, under any circumstances, be conveyed that there is a link between any individual living in this jurisdiction and what happened on 11 September.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the powers available to An Garda Síochána are stringent and effective. However, there may be areas which could be strengthened and if they exist, I would be happy to consider any suggestions constructively.</P>

      <P>I know that all Members of the House would have been deeply shocked by the events referred to in the Deputy's question and would join me in expressing sympathy, in particular, to the mother of the child involved. The circumstances of the case in question remain under investigation and, pending the outcome of that investigation, there are clearly limits to the amount of detail I can give to the House.</P>
      <P>The child in question disappeared from Douglas, Cork on 4 December 1999. I understand, as with all cases of missing persons, the Garda Síochána, upon notification of the disappearance, immediately commenced inquiries and reached a preliminary conclusion that the child had been abducted by her father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, on 7 December 1999, members of the Garda Síochána in Douglas contacted the central authority for child abduction, based in my Department, and outlined the circumstances of the abduction. Through the solicitor of the child's mother, the central authority immediately set about offering the services of the international network of central authorities for the return of <Col N="57" /> the child to her mother, under the terms of The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. However, it is understood the child's mother decided not to avail of this offer and, instead, engaged the services of a solicitor in England and Wales. I further understand various orders were obtained in the High Court of Justice, family division, in London for the return of the child under The Hague Convention. However, the child was not located in that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I understand, concurrently, established procedures in relation to missing persons were implemented by the Garda Síochána with regard to this case. These procedures involve the Garda district officer of the area from which a person goes missing taking direct responsibility for the investigation and employing all necessary investigative means, including, as required, the services of all specialist units. Moreover, a Garda liaison officer was appointed to liaise with one appointed family member in order to update the family on any developments that took place.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that, in such cases, the Garda Síochána does all in its power to locate the missing person and that it provides considerable support to the family. Unfortunately, in this case, the child and her father remained unlocated for some considerable time. However, on 30 August last, members of the Garda Síochána visited a house known as Croan Lodge on Coleville Road, Clonmel, County Tipperary. The House will be aware that, in the events which unfolded, the gardaí discovered the bodies of the missing child and her father. Both had received fatal gunshot wounds. The scene was examined by the Garda Technical Bureau and was visited by the State Pathologist, Dr. John Harbison.</P>
    <P>In the light of the tragic outcome of this case, the Garda Commissioner appointed a senior officer to examine and investigate all aspects of the circumstances surrounding this incident. It would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on the detail of this matter pending completion of that investigation.</P>

      <P>First, will the report being prepared by the senior officer appointed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána be made available to Members of this House? Second, has the investigation which was ordered after the tragic events of 13 August been concluded? Third, does the Minister expect to receive a copy of that report and, if so, when? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the Garda Commissioner has asked for a report on this matter. I certainly have not seen the report yet. I will take the advice of the Garda Commissioner on whether a report such as this should be published. It may not be in the interest of the general public that a report dealing with operational matters should be published. I am assured by the Gárda Commissioner that every effort was made by the <Col N="58" /> force to trace the people concerned. There was no stop-go approach. The investigation continued from the moment it was informed of this to the tragic event which occurred in August. Obviously, it is a matter of deep regret to everybody that the terrible incident occurred. The Garda Síochána, for its part, did everything it possibly could. The child abduction branch of my Department did offer its assistance. All I can say is that, if there are any lessons to be learned from this, we will certainly take them on board. However, I stress that the Garda Síochána did everything humanly possible in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is in the public interest that the report being prepared for the Garda Commissioner be published? Will he indicate to the House whether he agrees that such report should be published in the public interest? Second, does the Minister agree that his Department &ndash; the child abduction section, as described by him, which acts as the central authority under the Hague convention &ndash; had no role or function in the context of a child who is abducted and remains within the jurisdiction of this State? What instructions were given to members of the Garda Síochána on the action to be taken should the child, Deirdre, be found and her whereabouts discovered? Finally, does the Minister agree that the tragedy which took place &ndash; an appalling tragedy for the mother of this child and which, I am sure, impacted on members of the Garda Síochána &ndash; nevertheless gives rise to a serious question. Was it appropriate that members of the Garda Síochána, having identified the whereabouts of the father and the child in a house, left that place of residence and went to make a telephone call, during which time this tragedy occurred? Does the Minister agree it is in the public interest to ascertain why, at the time when the father and child were identified and there whereabouts became known, the child was not, at that stage, taken into Garda security and the father was not arrested, as he should have been, under existing legislation on child abduction? </P>

      <P>First, I will decide whether I believe it is in the public interest that the report should be published when I see the report. It may well be the case that it is in the public interest that the report be published. It may well be the case that it is not in the public interest that it be published for the reason that, in reports such as this, matters which are confidential to the Garda Síochána in relation to their operations, should remain precisely so.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As follow-up to the world conference on racism, I intend to prepare, in partnership with civil society, and relevant statutory bodies, a national action plan against racism. Many anti-racist initiatives are planned between now and 21 March 2001 &ndash; world anti-racism day &ndash; including the launch of the National Anti-Racism Awareness Programme on 24 October 2001; anti-racism workplace week, November 2001; the preparation of Ireland's national report under the United Nations Convention on the <Col N="60" /> elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, due in January 2002; the publication of the second report on Ireland by the European Commission on racism and intolerance, due in March 2002.</P>
      <P>I intend to facilitate the holding of a seminar, with civil society participation in the context of preparing a national action plan, around world anti-racism day in March 2002, using experience from the above initiatives and reports with a view to producing a final action plan before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>On the question of keeping separate statistics on racist crimes, I understand from the Gárda Síochána that a working definition of what constitutes a racist incident has been agreed and data capture of racially motivated crimes and offences is being developed. Gardaí are engaged in a continuing consultation process with members of ethnic minority groups and are in regular contact with community leaders. At present, there is close contact with leaders of the Muslim community to address their vulnerability at this time. Community groups are encouraged to report incidents to local gardaí and are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Garda racial and intercultural office.</P>
      <P>It is important that the House acknowledges that the Taoiseach visited members of the Muslim community and this was a very welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Amnesty International recently published a report entitled Racism in Ireland, in which the views of the black and ethnic minority groups were outlined. They were alarmed at the levels of racism here. What is the Minister's reaction to that report? What reports has he received in recent days on racist attacks, particularly against the Muslim community? The Minister said in Durban that he thought there was a potential problem here in relation to racist crime. Does he accept there is a problem in that regard? Does the Minister agree this is a time for leadership in this area? Does he agree there is evidence that the attitudes of Irish people are in formation in relation to this issue but that strong leadership is needed? Does the Minister agree it is time to launch a national plan in which the efforts of all are co-ordinated and that the public is given leadership on this issue by all the agencies with responsibility but primarily by Government? When does the Minister propose to launch a comprehensive national action plan to tackle racism and show leadership to people in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has embarked on major legislative change where racism is concerned in recent years. The Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act, for example, prohibit discrimination on nine specific grounds, including that of ethnic origin, in the provision of employment and services, respectively. In addition, we are currently reviewing the Incitement to Hatred Act which, I accept, is not <Col N="61" /> operating effectively as there has been only one prosecution under it. However, we have also established a Human Rights Commission and we are in the process of incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish Law. All these measures enabled us to ratify for the first time in our history the 1965 convention against racism and that was a very welcome development in recent times.</P>
      <P>I said in South Africa, and I repeat now, that I will do everything I possibly can, as will the Government, to ensure racism does not take up its ugly root in this jurisdiction. That is not to say there is not a tendency to racism among some people, but I contend they are in a minority. In this context, in February of this year, I set up a high level steering group under Mr. Joe McDonagh, the former president of the GAA, and requested that he bring forward implementation plans in respect of the aims and objectives set out by the committee dealing with interculturalism and racism. On 24 October, I hope to launch that plan. In May of this year, we announced some initiatives. The comprehensive plan, which will cost £4.5 million over a three year period, will be launched on 24 October and it will address the racism issue in the context of communications, media, education, political parties and so on. I am confident it will be successful.</P>
      <P>The report of Amnesty International to which Deputy Fitzgerald referred is being examined in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by the Garda Síochána. In this respect, I assure the Deputy that the steps which have been taken to date have been a major advance on anything that occurred before and we are progressing with the implementation of the public awareness programme which will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the legislation on incitement to hatred is not, in effect, working. Will he outline to the House the timetable for changing that legislation? What are the current statistics available to the Minister on racist crime? Is the issue of training for gardaí in the area of racism being addressed and, if so, how is it being addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter question, the training of the Garda Síochána is being addressed in Templemore. Gardaí are being trained, for example, in relation to obligations under the European Conventions on Human Rights and on the legislative position in regard to discrimination. As a core part of the training of members of the Garda Síochána in Templemore, there is a module regarding obligations under international human rights instruments and that includes the UN convention to which I referred earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has taken a number of initiatives on policing in an intercultural society. It has agreed guiding principles for dealing with interculturalism, including the commitment to treat everyone fairly. To enhance the operational <Col N="62" /> capacity of the gardaí in providing a police service in an intercultural Ireland, the Garda authorities have established a Garda national racial and intercultural office. As part of the Council of Europe human rights and policing initiative, the Garda has also established a working group to develop policy and practice on human rights and policing issues.</P>
    <P>There is no definition at present of a racist offence in Irish criminal law. All of the offences, I imagine, are covered in one form or another in different criminal legislation. However, what I stated in my reply is that the Garda is now coming up with a definition of what will constitute, for its purposes, a racial incident. This will enable us in the future to compile a list of such incidents so that we will be able to give information on this matter and be in a position to monitor it so that it can be tackled effectively at a policing level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the importance of having audio-video recording equipment installed as quickly as possible in Garda stations across the country. I am informed by the Garda authorities that 150 rooms have been fitted out to date and that 50 units of audio-video recording equipment have been installed at 27 locations. The Garda authorities, together with appropriate personnel from the Office of Public Works, are working towards having the remaining selected stations fitted out with the required technical equipment at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stated in reply to previous questions on the matter that delays were experienced by the Garda authorities at the tender evaluation stage of the project. These delays were of a technical nature and to do with certain equipment submitted for testing by the suppliers which resulted in a later than hoped for start to the delivery and installation of the equipment in the selected Garda stations. In addition, delays have been experienced with practical difficulties in fit<Col N="63" /> ting out the necessary interview rooms in a number of stations. I will let the Deputy have details of the locations fitted out to date, and those to be completed, at an early date.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not embarrassed or at least disappointed that an announcement he made two years and two months ago to have 200 stations fitted out with audio-video recording machines within 18 months has yet to be implemented? Of the 150 stations he says are now fitted out, how many operate the audio-video recording machines as a matter of routine? How many members of the Garda Síochána have been trained in the protocols and procedures required under the Act for the taking of evidence under the new regime? In concrete terms, when will the final number of stations &ndash; 200 &ndash; that were promised such equipment two years and two months ago be operational?</P>

      <P>anything about it. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I secured the necessary funding to ensure the stations would be fitted out with audio video equipment and that was a significant achievement. I am disappointed the work has not been carried out in all these stations to date. I indicated that all stations would be fitted out by the end of this year but, unfortunately, for a number of reasons this has not proved to be possible. As I already stated, there were delays initially at the tender-evaluation stage of the process which held up the placing of the required order for the equipment. Moreover, delays have been, and continue to be, experienced at some locations when adapting the rooms to accommodate the equipment. That said, I expect that in excess of 100 units of audio video recording equipment will be installed by the end of this year. The number of rooms which have been fitted out to date is 150. Of these, 50 units have the recording equipment installed at 27 different locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in March 1993 that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis. The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice. The Government decision was issued to all Departments as guidelines, which were further extended in March 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature, etc. Each Minister is responsible for implementing the Government's gender balance policy in his or her own area. My Department <Col N="68" /> monitors the progress in appointing women to State boards on a quarterly basis and constantly keeps the situation under review.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made since 1992 in relation to gender balance on boards. Women's representation in all appointments, including external nominations from nominating bodies, increased from 15% in 1992 to 28% at 30 June this year and from 17% to 35% of ministerial nominations in the same period. Women now comprise 19% of chairs of boards. With regard to appointments made in the first six months of 2001, 38% of the persons nominated by Ministers were women, while 30% of those nominated by other bodies were women.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the imbalance between men and women on State boards is that women have not yet reached top management levels in significant numbers in many areas. Recent research on gender equality in the Civil Service demonstrates this. This research report stated that women, compared with men, can expect to enter at a lower level and progress more slowly through the grading structures. Much work remains to be done to ensure that women achieve equality.</P>
      <P>While significant progress has been made towards the target of a minimum of 40% of both men and women on State boards, we are anxious to close the remaining 5% deficit in ministerial nominations and 12% deficit in overall nominations. To this end we intend to bring proposals to Cabinet shortly.</P>
      <P>Membership of State Boards end June, 2001</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister of State that the situation has deteriorated in the past year. In September of last year, the figure was 29% while it has now dropped to 28%. How can she, as Minister of State with responsibility for equality issues, stand over that situation? How can she stand over a situation where the Government has made no progress? We have gone backwards in gender equality on State boards. How can we take seriously the Taoiseach's announcement last week regarding targets for achieving greater participation of women at senior levels in the Civil Service if these targets are practically being ignored by Government and are not being reached, despite the fact that Ministers have direct control over nominations to State boards whereas control in relation to the Civil Service is indirect? Given that the targets for membership of State boards are not taken seriously, how can we be expected to take the Taoiseach's announcement last week seriously? Was that simply a pious platitude in the lead up to a general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be recognised that 35% of nominations to State boards are made by Ministers and they do not control nominations made by other organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been saying for some time that we want an improvement in the figures. This policy was successful initially in the early to mid-1990s but it needs a further injection in terms of progress. The Minister has stated in reply to a number of parliamentary questions that proposals will be brought to Government shortly to strengthen this policy and we would be glad to consider any suggestions Members have in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the Taoiseach's announcement on the Civil Service. It is important to recognise that if women do not reach middle management they <Col N="70" /> will not proceed to senior management positions and, therefore, the proposal to appoint women to one third of the vacancies at assistant principal level within the next five years in the Civil Service is important. It is a positive target which would allow women to attain senior positions and allow them to be nominated to State boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>When there was a Minister for Equality and Law Reform in the Cabinet the 40% target was rigorously implemented. It is within the powers of the Ministers at the Department to implement the target if they want. Is the Minister of State satisfied that her senior colleague is taking this issue seriously given that it is the Department's job to monitor this policy? Does she agree that if there was a Minister for equality in the Cabinet, the gender balance policy would be fully implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain why the Cabinet mechanism of equality proofing is failing despite a Government commitment that women would comprise 40% of the membership of State boards? Appointments were made to a number of boards last year and Deputy O'Sullivan and others pointed out that the gender balance target had not been met. Why is there not effective monitoring of this Government policy at Cabinet level? What does the Minister of State and her senior colleague intend to do in this regard? What action has been taken to improve the guidelines. Who has been consulted in regard to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy was introduced in the early 1990s and there was never a mechanism whereby the Government would be informed about the overall picture in terms of appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Minister's suggestions is the provision of direct reporting to Cabi<Col N="71" /> net as distinct from issuing statistics which are published quarterly and are provided to Members through replies to parliamentary questions and other methods. He has made other suggestions which have not yet been put to Cabinet to strengthen this policy and bridge the 5% gap in ministerial nominations of women to State boards. Nominations by outside bodies must also be examined because there is a 12% deficit in this area which needs to be addressed. I assure the House that the Minister has solid recommendations which will be put before the Cabinet shortly to address both those facets of the policy. There will be then a fresh injection of enthusiasm to deal with these aspects of the policy when nominating women to State boards and to achieve the 40% target at all levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Taoiseach and as leader of Fianna Fáil, I express my sincere sympathy on the death of Kevin Boland. To his wife Cis and children Brendán, Caitlín, Síle and Fachtna, and to his brothers and sisters I send my sympathies and the sympathy of my colleagues.</P>
      <P>Kevin Boland came from an illustrious family that made an important contribution to the achievement and consolidation of Irish freedom, as we have it today. He was a patriot, a lover of the Irish language and a passionate Republican. He was a soldier of destiny who never shrank from what he believed that destiny should be. He was passionate about politics and he passionately cared about both his country and about Fianna Fáil which was in his blood.</P>
      <P>Bhí grá mór ag Caomhaoin Ó Beoláin don Ghaeilge agus don tír seo. Níor chlaon sé ariamh ón tuairim a bhí aige faoi cad ba chóir a dhéanamh ar son Poblacht na hÉireann. Bhí dúil mhór aige sa phoblacht freisin agus d'oibrigh sé i rith a shaol chun a spriocanna polaitiúla a fháil amach.</P>
      <P>Although known as Kevin Boland, it was as Caomhaoin Ó Beoláin that he signed official papers. He was a lover of the language and it played a large role in his identity and politics. Kevin Boland was the third generation of a family that was steeped in the Gaelic revival and republican politics. His grandfather James Boland was born in Manchester and was a member of the Fenians. He went on to become a founder of the GAA. Kevin's uncle Harry and father Gerry were major figures in their own right, whose reputations have stood the test of time. This was the political legacy inherited by Kevin Boland and it was a legacy &ndash; as he saw it &ndash; to which he was determined to remain true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this distance, many people will only remember the important events of 1969 and 1970 but Kevin Boland had a long ministerial career in the epoch-making series of Administrations of Eamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch, leading into the 1960s . It was a career that began on his first day in the Dáil in 1957 when he was <Col N="73" /> appointed Minister for Defence. From 1961, he was Minister for Social Welfare, showing a strong compassion for the less well off. His outlook was always to favour the have nots. He co-operated with the then Minister for Agriculture Charles Haughey in introducing the farmers' dole.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Local Government, he was responsible for the first ever tenant purchase scheme to permit local authority tenants to purchase their homes. As a civil engineer by profession, he would have had a very good understanding of the construction industry. He was famous for his impatience with Dublin conservationists and titled landlords. These controversies contributed to the formation of a more balanced approach subsequently.</P>
    <P>His personal life was characterised by his modest lifestyle which differed little from the working people and small farmers of County Dublin whom he represented. He had very austere views about political fund raising but he lived in a time when it was the Minister's prerogative to draw the electoral boundaries until the system was fundamentally reformed by Jack Lynch as Taoiseach in the late 1970s . He carried out these duties with characteristic efficiency. The events of 1969 and 1970 are well known. They are all the better known because Kevin wrote several intelligent and challenging books in the intervening years, setting out his views on these events as well as the wider issues relating to the state of the nation. It would be fair to say that he expressed some disillusionment not just with the Governments of his day, but even with the founder of his party. He acknowledged that he might not have fully grasped at the time the essential moderation and subtlety of de Valera's statesmanship in relation to Northern Ireland. It will be for history to be the final judge and for posterity to make up its mind on the prudence and realism of the positions of him and others when the Northern crisis broke.</P>
    <P>Kevin Boland was the first to leave the stage. He left his Government and, honouring his party pledge, resigned his seat in Dáil Éireann on an issue of policy and as a matter of integrity. However, Kevin Boland in no sense left politics. He founded Aontacht Éireann, which was not a successful political venture, and long afterwards continued to fight for principles in which he believed, both politically and constitutionally, in a way that precluded compromise. His taking of a constitutional case in 1974 contributed to loss of confidence in the Sunningdale Agreement. His steadfast adherence to his belief was respected. Nevertheless, many of us feel a certain sadness that this gifted man, who had a long and positive ministerial career over 13 years, felt compelled to cut himself off from mainstream political life, thus limiting the possibility of being able to make further constructive contributions to public life. He argued that Fianna Fáil had left him rather than the other way around and he had a small but faithful band of followers who, for a time at least, <Col N="74" /> shared his view, although most of them returned to the fold.</P>
    <P>In the history of Dáil Éireann, only a handful have come into the House as Kevin Boland did by being appointed a Minister on his first day as a Deputy. None has left this House as he did, entirely of his own volition and in a blaze of controversy. Having fought all his life for what he believed, I trust he has now found his eternal and honourable rest. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ar ócáid bhás Chaoimhghín Uí Bheoláin, ba mhaith liom ar mo chionn féin agus thar ceann mo pháirtí, Fine Gael, comhbhrón a dhéanamh lena chlann, lena bhean chéile, Cecilia, lena mhic, Breandán agus Fachtna, lena hiníonacha, Síle agus Caitlín, le ball eile da chlann, Oisín agus lena ioliomad comhghleacaithe agus cáirde.</P>
      <P>B'fhear é Caoimhghín a chreid go láidir i bprionsabail na seirbhíse poiblí agus an phoblachtánachais. Ní bréag é a rá gur chuir sé na prionsabail sin chun tosaigh ar gach ní eile ina shaol, fiú ar a dhul chun cinn pearsanta i saol na polaitíochta. Ba idéalaí é. Cé gur fíor a rá nár aontaigh mé féin ná mo pháirtí le morán de na rudaí a chreid Caoimhin Ó Beoláin iontu, bhí meas ariamh agam ar a dhíogras.</P>
      <P>Is faoi na staraithe a fágfar é, Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin a mheas ó thaobh an Stáit seo ach ba dheacair a shéanadh nach mbeidh a leithéid arís ann.</P>
      <P>On the death of Kevin Boland, I wish to record the sympathy of Fine Gael to Kevin's wife, Cecilia, and to his extended circle of family, friends and admirers. It is only right in marking his passing that I should avoid any cant or hypocrisy. It will not surprise anybody in the House if I say that while there is much to admire in his extensive career, Kevin Boland's strongly held views on the development of relations between the two parts of the island and between Ireland and Britain would rarely have found favour with my party. It is fair to say that we held diametrically opposite views on most occasions on most things.</P>
      <P>However, it is also appropriate that I join with former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave in acknowledging the relentless and dogged commitment to the pursuit of his own ideological goals that Kevin Boland displayed throughout his parliamentary career. When that career was truncated by the events in 1970 that are all too well documented, Kevin Boland continued to pursue his ideals outside the House. It was rare to come across such a committed idealist who is neither deflected nor deterred by such a major setback. For that alone, he must be admired and his contribution acknowledged. If political discourse is enhanced by the contest of ideas, then public life will be poorer for the loss of Kevin Boland's great honesty and integrity in advancing his distinctive republican beliefs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I <Col N="75" /> wish to extend to the Boland family and particularly to Kevin Boland's widow, Cecilia, our sincere sympathies on the death of the former politician, Member of the House and Minister. Those of us who are old enough, or perhaps young enough, to remember Kevin Boland as I do inside and outside the House recall somebody who was a passionate and ardent nationalist. I would have disputed his interpretation of republicanism, but nobody could dispute his absolute commitment and integrity regarding the things in which he believed.</P>
      <P>This is not the time or the place to give an evaluation of somebody's political career or to point to the areas where there would have been consistent and considerable difference. In marking the passing of an elected representative of the people in this Republic, we should pay particular tribute to the scale and depth of his feeling and to the extent of his integrity &ndash; an integrity that was not emulated by others in his party at the time. When he found himself in conflict with, on the one hand, the dictates of the party Whip and, on the other, his conscience, he chose not just to resign from the parliamentary party but to resign from the House. Of all the things that will characterise Kevin Boland's commitment to the integrity of politics, that event has no emulation or copy. On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our condolences to his extended family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I express our sincere sympathy to the family of Kevin Boland. He was a product of the War of Independence and the Civil War. He was a deep green republican, perhaps green tooth and claw. Some would say that he was uncompromising, but equally it could be said that he was a man of principle. When he resigned from Cabinet, it was on a matter of principle. There was a certain bitterness that others who were part of that scenario did not join his party later. There is a famous quote from Mr. Haughey who said that Mr. Boland fought for the sake of fighting, while he fought to win. This sums up his approach to politics.</P>
      <P>My only encounter with Mr. Boland was during the visit of Prince Charles to Dublin. I vividly recall an elderly gentleman screaming abuse at us in the Mansion House from across the road. I was told that he was the former Minister, Mr. Boland. I did not take it badly. It is in everybody's interest to have protests. It was his democratic right to protest and he was a person of principle despite his flaws &ndash; we all have flaws. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to offer my sympathy and the sympathy of my organisation to the Boland family on the death of Kevin Boland. Nobody could doubt his integrity and he gave up everything as far as the political scene was concerned for what he felt to be the truth at the time. He did not resign from the parliamentary party <Col N="76" /> or give up his ministerial post because he had sympathy for Neil Blaney or Charles Haughey. He resigned because he knew the truth from the Cabinet table.</P>
      <P>The media and others have said that he resigned in sympathy, but if Neil Blaney or Charles Haughey had been Taoiseach at the time, he would have done the same thing. He felt so strongly about it that he gave up his three posts in the name of integrity. He took part in a by-election that he knew he could not win, although he had been a Member of the House. He did not win and he was in the wilderness until his death. I offer my sympathy and the sympathy of our organisation to his family. I know where his heart lay in relation to the nationalist question. The likes of Kevin Boland will not be seen in the House again and certainly not at the moment.</P>

      <P>I wish to record my sympathy and the sympathy of Sinn Féin to the wife, sons and daughters of the late Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin. He was a man of strong principle and a lover of the Irish language and Gaelic games. Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin, Kevin Boland, was a man admired and respected by nationalist and republican people throughout the island of Ireland, not least of all by people in the Border counties with whom he associated over a long and protracted campaign in the pursuit of the reopening of closed cross-Border roads. His appearance at these events and his support, encouragement and camaraderie with many people who were not from the traditionalist activist community meant so much and was greatly appreciated.</P>
      <P>Kevin Boland, whom I had the pleasure to meet on a number of occasions and with whom I always enjoyed conversation and discussion, was a gentleman of generous nature. He was of a kind disposition, but he was also fierce in his commitment to his beliefs, something he recorded time after time. He was a man to be respected and admired.</P>
      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of Sinn Féin, I record my sympathy not only to his wife and children, but to his brother and all the extended Boland family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>In view of the publication of the Exchequer returns yesterday, can the Taoiseach explain to the House why there is such a serious discrepancy between the outturn at the end of September and the budget estimates in respect of tax revenue? I understand the estimate was that tax revenue across all heads would increase by 12.5%. By the end of September tax revenue had increased by 2.5%. Public expenditure continues to rise in excess of 20%. Could the Taoiseach explain to the House what has gone wrong, what has happened since the Minister introduced the budget in this House and what are the new circumstances which gave rise to such a discrepancy? Is it the Government's intention to budget for a surplus in 2002? What instruction has been issued to Departments by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Taoiseach in the preparation of Estimates for 2002? </P>

Both facts and figures must surely have a bearing on the viability of the Campus Stadium project and could run the risk, if not properly revised, of invalidating any conclusions which the consultants might publish in the next five days if they have not taken those factors into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The end of September figures for the 2001 Exchequer returns show that tax revenue continues to perform more weakly than was forecast, as Deputy Noonan stated. The tax flows to the end of September show an increase of 2.2% over the receipts in the same period last year compared to a budget target of 12.5% over the 2000 outturn. The weaknesses across most tax heads in direct tax receipts, which have been evident since the imposition of the foot and mouth disease restrictions, are now also apparent in income tax receipts. They have drifted from the first quarter right through the year. The figure at all times has continued to increase. Current expenditure is slightly behind the Revised Estimates volume target, while voted capital expenditure is in line with expectations. Therefore, while expenditure has gone up this year, it was budgeted expenditure and is in line with projections. If I recall correctly from looking at the figures last night for four Departments, including the Environment and Local Government, and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the profiles of the figures are behind expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest expectation for our Exchequer surplus this year is that it will be at least 1.9 billion, or 1.5 billion lower than forecast on budget day, although it could, possibly, be more than that. A shortfall of 1.9 billion would give a projected general Government deficit of <Col N="80" /> 2.5%. These figures emphasise the need for us to adapt our expectations to the new economic situation and adopt a prudent approach. That is what we have to do in the short-term in order to return to good economic growth rates. Deputy Noonan asked what has gone wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the national accounts figures showed an increase in the first quarter of about 10.4%. Therefore, last year's 11.5% growth carried into the first quarter. Three issues have gone wrong. First, clearly, the effect of foot and mouth disease on tourism and other activities affected indirect taxes throughout the second, third and final quarters. Second, the global slowdown emanating from the United States and Japan affected production in the Asian economies. Last year, most of those countries, other than Japan, were forecasting good economic growth, but that has slowed down. That is not the only area affected by information-communication technologies, but it is a big one.</P>
      <P>The eight month figures from the United States show a 50% slowdown in production and growth in the ICT sector. That slowdown is fairly unbelievable and, although it has nothing to do with the events of 11 September, it has fed right into the Asian economies, including production in our own ICT companies. While most companies in that sector have managed to maintain employment levels, the slowdown presents a major difficulty. The third reason, which is not included in these figures, is the aftermath of the events of 11 September, and we are closely monitoring that situation.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to what both the ESRI and the Central Bank have stated, based on the first six months of the year. They have projected growth for the year to be somewhere between 5% and 7%. That is a high projection and I would have thought it would be on the lower end, at 5%. The ESRI and Central Bank are carrying over that figure into next year at 4.5%. Looking at the nine month figures and the projections, the Deputy correctly asked what has gone wrong. While the first quarter was excellent, the second and third quarters were not so and we will be very lucky for that carry-over to reach 4.5%.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>As regards the Deputy's other question, Departments have been instructed to return their Estimates with a view to maintaining existing services. No new schemes should be built into that, apart from those to be announced on budget day. We must ensure indexation and Christmas bonuses are built into the figures, but not additional, new or extended programmes. That is the basis of the circular.</P>

However, he did not answer another part of my question: is the Government planning to budget for a surplus in 2002? He might deal with that issue when he replies to my supplementary question. Much of the decline in the public finances is due to domestic reasons. A misconceived budgetary policy by the Government has now run the country into trouble. After four years of unprecedented prosperity we are now facing a fiscal crisis. The farming and tourism industries are in crisis as are public services, including all the State companies. The Government has spent the country into a crisis, as has often happened before with Fianna Fáil-led Governments. We now have a crisis in the public finances and are on the cusp of a major fiscal crisis.</P>

      <P>I can understand the reason Deputy Noonan is trying to put forward that argument, but I totally reject it.

I would argue the exact opposite to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would argue the opposite. If we did not have last year's fiscal policy, there is no way we would be standing out as the only country in the western world that is talking about growth rates of 5%. No other country is talking about unemployment remaining at current levels or employment increasing. No other country has visa requirements for 1,000 people. Nobody else's exports are holding as well as ours, although, admittedly, they are declining.</P>
      <P>It is precisely because of the fiscal policies of the Minister for Finance last December that we have managed to get to this stage without the kind of problems that are occurring in Asian countries. Growth in Singapore has gone from 10% to nil, while Japan's growth rate has fallen from 3% to minus 2%. Economies around the world are experiencing enormous difficulties, but we are holding our own in dealing with the situation.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's first question about next year's surplus, it is too early to say. As I stated, a shortfall of 1.9 billion would give a general Government deficit of 2.5%. We have to examine the last quarter figures, however, and the third quarter figures were worse than we thought they would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Bill published yesterday by the Government is in conflict with Article 46 of the Constitution? Article 46.4 states: &ldquo;A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of this Constitution shall not contain any other proposal.&rdquo;  Would he agree that the Bill published yesterday contains two separate and distinct proposals to amend the Constitution and to attach a criminal statute to it? On our analysis, and on the legal advice available to the Labour Party, this appears to be in breach of the procedures for amending the Constitution and explicitly in breach of Article 46.4 which states, &ldquo;A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of this Constitution shall not contain any other proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TheTaoiseach will be aware that there are two <Col N="83" /> Schedules in the legislation &ndash; one to amend Article 40 and the second to attach draft legislation which could, possibly, become law if enacted by this House after the amendment is made to the Constitution. Will the Taoiseach assure the House that we are not embarking on another legal quagmire which will raise more constitutional problems than it will solve?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn's analysis. It seems that to attach penalties of 12 years to acts of abortion is an extraneous matter which is outside the scope of Article 46. I am seeking clarification of this matter. There are many questions which I will put to the Taoiseach on another occasion and in another way. However, will he clarify a core element of the proposal that if the proposed Bill is enacted and subsequently amended in this House, that amendment has to be put to the people? The proposed Bill gives the Minister for Health and Children power to change the terms of the Bill by orders which do not have to be put to the people or the House by way of positive motion. This seems ambiguous and we are well down the road to the legal quagmire. I do not wish to engage in a Committee Stage debate, but there are at least 20 questions which require answers before there is any clarity about the impact of the proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy Quinn's question, there are two provisions in the legislation. The first gives constitutional protection for the enactment by the Oireachtas of legislation, <Col N="84" /> the terms of which have been seen and approved by the people. The second provision requires that a subsequent legislative amendment would be required to be approved by the people in a referendum before being signed. The Deputy suggested that these provisions are separate, but they are related. This issue has been well checked out and my advice is that it does not go against the Constitution. That is my legal advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution as we read it is very clear. The Article which allows for the amending of the Constitution states that one cannot piggyback on to a proposal to amend the Constitution any other proposal. One can have a series of proposals to amend the Constitution, but one cannot have a proposal to amend and, in addition, another proposal which, in this instance, is a criminal statute which may be enacted subsequent to the ratification of the change by way of amendment.</P>
      <P>This issue is of critical importance to every Member. In the light of this fact, will the Taoiseach formally undertake to publish the legal advice he received from the Attorney General for which I will cite two precedents? In 1983 the former Attorney General, Peter Sutherland, published advice concerning a similar, so-called, pro-life amendment. In 1995 the former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, published his legal advice in respect of the divorce legislation. This is a matter of fundamental importance.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion the Taoiseach withdrew the measure regarding the sanction of judicial conduct legislation in the absence of all-party or substantial agreement across the floor of the House. It is necessary that he publish his legal advice as, on a <i>prima facie</i> analysis of this provision, he is in breach of the Constitution if he intends to proceed in the manner outlined in the Bill published yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On 18 September, all parties came together in a specially convened session of Dáil Éireann to convey our sorrow and outrage at the tragic events in the United States. Our collective voice expressed in very clear terms where the Irish people stand in the face of the outrages committed in the United States on 11 September.</P>
      <P>History tells us that often out of great tragedy comes courage, a determination to rebuild society, to establish the democratic rule and to bring evil men of violence and terrorists to justice. In the past weeks, since the terrible events in the United States, we have seen the courage of President Bush and the American people. The trauma they have suffered is clearly enormous. So many families have been bereaved and must now face the reality that their loved ones may never be recovered from the scenes of the attacks.</P>
      <P>Many families in our country have also endured enormous loss and suffering. The list, published on Monday of Irish people and those of Irish descent declared dead or missing makes sombre reading. No policies or Government actions can relieve their sense of loss and the vacuum now in their lives. We again extend our sympathy to the bereaved and commend all the American emergency services for their unrelenting work in the scenes of devastation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our task now is to ensure, through enhanced and sustained international co-operation, that no people, whether Irish, American or other <Col N="94" /> nationalities, will have to experience this trauma again.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the determination of the United States to put in place a global response to global terrorism. In doing so, it has sought and deserves the support of all nations dedicated to the principles of democracy and to combating this terrible evil.</P>
    <P>We all understand and accept that those who directed the attacks on 11 September and those who are intent on further such deeds must be pursued. It would be naive to believe that dialogue and discussion are realistic options in the face of terrorism which is intent on savage and destructive assaults on innocent people. There is no doubt they will try to strike again and no one can know where this might be. People prepared and determined to behave in this way must be stopped in their tracks.</P>
    <P>The United States has already declared its intention to take military action to this end. Under the UN Charter every member state has a right to self defence. It is clearly the wish of the international community that any action taken should be based on clear evidence and be proportionate, measured and focused on the pursuit of justice and the sources of terrorism.</P>
    <P>None of us can be indifferent to the effects of military intervention in Afghanistan, however well focused. Everyone in this House wishes to see civilian casualties avoided. The avoidance of civilian casualties is also manifestly in the interests of the United States.</P>
    <P>The Afghan people have suffered the ravages of internal wars and a prolonged famine. Ireland will play its part in helping to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. The announcement this week of an additional aid package of £2.8 million brings the total emergency assistance provided by Ireland to Afghanistan this year to some £4 million. This is the largest ever aid package provided by the Government for a single emergency.</P>
    <P>Military action alone cannot succeed in combating terrorists and their supporters. Multi-layered responses that work to eliminate the roots of terrorism must also be pursued. It is at times such as these that the need for strong international organisations is all the more apparent. Global terrorism is a threat to international peace and security. International institutions, particularly the United Nations and the European Union, are essential in pursuing the multi-layered approach we all agree is necessary.</P>
    <P>This week Ireland assumed the chair of the UN Security Council. We will hold this important position for the next month. While the Minister for Foreign Affairs will outline in more detail our response and the agenda we will pursue at that forum, I can assure the House that we will discharge our responsibilities to the maximum of our energies and capabilities. The United Nations must be the very cornerstone of the global response to these appalling atrocities.</P>
    <P>The day after the attacks the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1368. This <Col N="95" /> resolution was unequivocal in its condemnation of the attacks and stressed that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these acts will be held accountable. Last Friday the Security Council adopted a further resolution, Resolution 1373, which builds upon Resolution 1368, and provides additional measures to improve international co-operation in the fight against terrorism, including measures to suppress the financing of terrorism. Ireland was involved in a constructive way in the drafting of this resolution and as chair of the Security Council during the coming weeks we will be actively involved in advancing and monitoring the implementation of this important measure.</P>
    <P>No country can stand to one side in the face of international terrorism. Ireland has, is, and will continue to play its part to the fullest in tackling this most dangerous scourge. We have indicated to the United States that, in common with a wide range of states across the world, we will allow overflight and use of Irish airports by American military aircraft. This move is entirely consistent with our responsibilities as a member of the family of nations comprising the international community. I also believe that the vast majority of Irish people and Members of this House support this measure as a concrete indication of where we stand on the issue of international terrorism. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will give further details of our co-operation in this area and of his meeting last week with Secretary of State, Colin Powell, in Washington. In taking this step under Security Council Resolution 1368, it should be clear that Ireland is not participating in any war and the question of Dáil assent does not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>To fully assess the implications of the terrorist attacks, an extraordinary meeting of the European Council took place in Brussels on Friday, 21 September. At that meeting, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs also attended, the Council agreed that the fight against terrorism will be a priority objective of the European Union. The extraordinary meeting of the Council called for the broadest possible global coalition against terrorism under the aegis of the United Nations. Solidarity is shown by actions not words. This horrendous attack is proof, were it needed, of the vulnerability of all our societies to ruthless terrorists.</P>
    <P>In the short-term we agreed that the European Union would co-operate with the United States in bringing to justice and punishing the perpetrators, sponsors and accomplices of the 11 September attacks. We recognised that a response by the United States would be legitimate on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 1368 and that actions may also be directed against States abetting, supporting or harbouring terrorists. We agreed that member states are prepared to act according to their means with the United States.</P>
    <P>That extraordinary meeting of the European <Col N="96" /> Council also agreed that top priority would be given to the introduction of a European arrest warrant to replace the current system of extradition between member states and the adoption of a common definition of terrorism. The Council also agreed to implement, as soon as possible, the full package of measures agreed at the European Council at Tampere in 1999.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to identify suspected terrorists, terrorist organisations, or organisations supporting terrorists throughout the European Union. The sharing of information will be critical if we are to safeguard our citizens. All useful data regarding terrorism will be shared through Europol and a specialist anti-terrorism team is to be set up within Europol. This team will liaise closely with its United States counterparts.</P>
    <P>A number of international conventions aimed at addressing terrorism already exist but not all have been implemented. Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373 call on member states to become parties to and to fully implement these conventions and the European Council has supported their implementation by all EU member states as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the context, the House will wish to note that the Government yesterday gave authority for Ireland to become a signatory to the International Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Funding. It is clear that cutting off the supply of funds to terrorists is a crucial element in combating terrorism. As long as there are funds available and directed to those who wish to destroy the fabric of our society, the fight against terrorism will not be fully effective. I have also asked that the highest priority be given to the ratification of other outstanding terrorist conventions.</P>
    <P>The new realities that now exist require effective and standardised air security measures. These must be introduced to ensure aircraft can no longer be hi-jacked and used as missiles of destruction. The European Council has thus requested the Transport Council of Ministers to take all necessary measures to strengthen air transport security.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt our membership of the European Union and the sensible, stability-centred policies that have been put in place within the framework of our membership will enable us to weather the economic turbulence which may now face the world. Thanks to economic and monetary union the countries of the euro zone are more sheltered from the shocks associated with monetary fluctuations. The introduction of the euro on 1 January next will give Ireland a key competitive advantage at a time when it will be most needed.</P>
    <P>The short-term effect on the airline sector in particular has been severe and has forced very difficult decisions on Aer Lingus along with most other airlines. There is to be a debate tomorrow on the impact on Aer Lingus and this matter will be addressed in detail on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The ESRI and the Central Bank, along with other economic commentators, have prepared a <Col N="97" /> range of different scenarios and projections, with different assumptions being made on exchange rate movements, interest rate changes and other factors. The Government's initial priority is to analyse international and domestic trends continuously and methodically. We will also focus on maintaining competitiveness and discipline, accepting that we are now in a period of some uncertainty and unpredictability. This will afford us the necessary space to respond in a manner that is most appropriate to a sudden or unexpected change in circumstances. The House can be assured that the Government will consider very carefully all relevant circumstances and scenarios in the context of Budget 2002.</P>
    <P>We need to retain confidence in the Irish economy and our achievements of the last decade. Economic growth this year will still exceed that of our European Union partners while unemployment remains at a record low. While not complacent about the short-term threat we face, I am confident that the Irish economy is fundamentally robust and that our foreign direct investment is appropriately mixed and balanced to weather the uncertainties which currently exist.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September sent shockwaves around the world. The unimaginable sight of airlines full of passengers being used as flying weapons signalled the beginning of a new order of global terrorism, a terrorism that is utterly ruthless and willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve its goals. The attacks on the United States have clearly changed the context in which emergency planning must be done. Therefore, a review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted has since taken place in my Department. As a result of this review the Government has decided that there should be an office of emergency planning led by the Department of Defence and with the involvement of the Defence Forces. That office, consulting with other Departments and agencies, as appropriate, has been tasked with preparing plans to meet these threats from global terrorism. The Government has also decided that the emergency planning office should have an oversight role in relation to planning for peacetime emergencies to make maximum use of resources and to ensure compatibility and co-ordination between plans prepared for peacetime emergencies and for emergencies arising from terrorist threats.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that there is no reason to believe Ireland is a target for international terrorist attacks. The most important defence against any attack is detection and prevention by the security forces. I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces that all necessary resources are being deployed to this end.</P>
    <P>In the current climate there is understandable concern and anxiety among Islamic communities who do not support or have any connection with terrorism. It was with a view to underlining the importance of making this distinction that I paid <Col N="98" /> a visit on Monday last to the Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh. The Muslim community who accorded me such a warm welcome made abundantly clear their abhorrence of terrorism and of the attacks on the United Sates.</P>
    <P>In our world the use of the superlative and hyperbole has become commonplace and there is always the danger that threats of truly awesome significance will be understated, but there is no understating what happened on 11 September. Moreover, any repetition would cause immeasurable damage to the world financial system, democratic values, global co-operation and the ability of the human race to look forward with confidence. This is why we must play our part in every way we can and to the fullest. We must not fail in our fight against world terrorism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely appropriate in the week in which the General Assembly of the United Nations is considering the responses which should be made to the atrocities in the United States on 11 September that this House should have the opportunity to continue the debate initiated at the special sitting of the House on 18 September last. On that occasion we formally conveyed our sympathy and made clear our solidarity with the United States as it seeks to come to grips with the most appalling act of international terrorism. This is an occasion for more specifics and for the Government to outline its exact position in detail.</P>
      <P>I regret the Taoiseach has not used this opportunity to inform the House in detail of what the Government proposes to do and what our precise foreign policy is in the new world situation created by the events of 11 September. It is important that the House be fully informed of the background and be given the opportunity to discuss and debate the detailed positions the Government proposes to take. It is not good enough that the Taoiseach should use a photo opportunity to say that the Government will give the United States refuelling and over flight facilities. We need to know exactly what this entails and how it fits into the redefinition of Irish foreign policy brought about by recent events.</P>
      <P>In my statement on 18 September in the Dáil, I emphasised the importance of the United Nations as providing a cornerstone for our foreign policy. The only basis for the conduct of international relations is the rule of law and the United Nations is the only organisation that provides the framework and the structures for dealing with the problems which the world now faces. I note Ireland's support at the United Nations Security Council for Resolution 1368 and Resolution 1373. I commend the Government for its input into these resolutions. The Taoiseach will agree that they represent only the beginning. As the Mayor of New York, Mr. Giuliani, said during his address to the UN General Assembly earlier this week: &ldquo;This is not a time for further study or for vague directives. It is a time for action.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a member of the committee of the <Col N="99" /> Security Council which has been set up and tasked with monitoring the implementation of Resolution 1373 which was passed on 28 September. All 189 member countries of the United Nations are now required to report to the committee within 90 days on steps they have taken to implement the resolution. The resolution requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that governments deal with the financing of terrorism, the exchange of intelligence between countries on the organisation of terrorism, the introduction of effective border controls to deal with the movement of terrorists and tackling the links between terrorism and illegal drug trafficking and other organised criminal activities.</P>
    <P>To give credibility to our activities on the monitoring committee, the most important and urgent thing is to ensure Ireland is fully compliant with the relevant United Nations conventions, protocols and resolutions. Some of these conventions, protocols and resolutions create difficulties for us which can only be overcome by enacting domestic legislation. However, I assure the Taoiseach, given the gravity and urgency of the situation, that the Fine Gael Party will be fully and constructively co-operative.</P>
    <P>As a helpful starting point, the Taoiseach might indicate before the debate concludes this evening what, if any, conventions, protocols and resolutions we need to ratify to be in full compliance with the Security Council resolution. I am aware, for example, that Ireland has not yet ratified the statute on the International Criminal Court or the Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, although the Taoiseach appeared to indicate that we would do so in the near future. The Taoiseach might also indicate the steps the Government proposes to take to bring Ireland into line and the time frame likely to be involved.</P>
    <P>The least we might do, given our current Security Council role, is to give the best possible public example to our fellow members in the United Nations. In 90 days the Taoiseach should circulate Ireland's response to Resolution 1373 to the House and arrange for it to be debated in detail. It seems that many of our positions consist of freely giving advice to other people on how to act without making any attempt to comply ourselves. I need not remind Members of the House that there is a terrorist problem on this island and that the resolution in question requires us to take certain specific action and to state publicly what that action is within 90 days. I am seeking a commitment from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs that within 90 days the action being taken by the Government will be laid before this House and that we will be given an opportunity to debate it.</P>
    <P>It would also be helpful to have a statement from the Taoiseach explaining what is now meant when the Government talks about neutrality as an element of Irish foreign policy. There is considerable public confusion on this point and much of it has been created by the conflict between <Col N="100" /> what Fianna Fáil says when it is in Opposition and what it does when it is in Government. In Opposition, Fianna Fáil opposed any link between Ireland and the Western European Union. In Government, Fianna Fáil took the first step to bring us into a relationship with the Western European Union by seeking and obtaining observer status. In Opposition and in its election manifesto in 1997, Fianna Fáil solemnly declared that Ireland would not participate in the NATO led Partnership for Peace without first putting the matter to the people in a referendum. In Government, Fianna Fáil back tracked on that commitment, did not hold a referendum and joined the Partnership for Peace, a NATO led grouping.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder there is confusion about what is meant by neutrality when this Government is in office, especially when we speak of Fianna Fáil neutrality? Lest there be any doubt, I wish to make it clear that Fine Gael supports Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace and Ireland's commitment to work with our partners in the European Union to achieve a common foreign policy. It is not enough for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs to say that we are not neutral when it comes to international terrorism. That is a given. Could we say anything else other than that we are opposed to international terrorism? That is not a definition of neutrality. The Taoiseach has an obligation today to state in unequivocal terms what is now meant by Irish neutrality against the background of the events of 11 September last.</P>
    <P>We need to know what the Government means by neutrality as an element in Irish foreign policy. It is important that the implications be spelled out fully and unambiguously. I hope the Taoiseach will arrange to do so in his concluding remarks to this debate or that he will arrange for an appropriate Minister to give us the details he, the Taoiseach, failed to give the House. It is the least the Irish people deserve as we move into an uncertain international future. Unless we know where the Government stands on this fundamental issue, we have no way of assessing or measuring our foreign policy decisions. This is not about soft talk to please American public opinion. It is not about photo opportunities. The events of 11 September were cataclysmic. They should generate change and the Taoiseach should spell out the manner in which Irish foreign policy is changed. Mere window dressing and lip service is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate to deal with the topic of terrorism without referring to the murder last Friday night of the <i>Sunday World</i> journalist Martin O'Hagan. I am sure I speak for everybody in the House when I convey to the O'Hagan family and his colleague journalists our deepest sympathy at this most appalling and brutal killing. All the indications are that the murder was carried out by a loyalist paramilitary terrorist group. I condemn terrorists from that source as strongly and unequivocally as I have condemned terrorism from the republican side.</P>
    <P>At a time when the peace process is under <Col N="101" /> threat, I once more call on the leadership of Sinn Féin and the IRA. The Good Friday Agreement is the property of the Irish people who have, in referenda North and South, supported its implementation. I accept the bona fides of the Sinn Féin leadership, particularly the bona fides of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. I acknowledge the work they have done in recent years to move away from the use of violence to achieve political objectives. It is surely possible for them to take the remaining steps to save the agreement. Unless there is movement on decommissioning and progress towards the acceptance of the new policing arrangements, it is difficult to see how the carefully crafted structures of the Good Friday Agreement can survive. This could well be the last opportunity for many years to have in Northern Ireland devolved government structures to which everyone can give allegiance.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been in the House for some time recall with regret the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974. There has been a long gap between the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974 and the putting in place of the arrangements flowing from the Good Friday Agreement, which are very similar to what was lost when the Sunningdale Agreement failed. Even though the Anglo-Irish Agreement was successfully negotiated and signed in 1985, it did not provide for devolved local political activity.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that Sinn Féin should redouble its efforts to ensure the survival of all the institutions of Government, so carefully negotiated. These institutions, Anglo-Irish, North-South and devolved to Northern Ireland, are already seen to be serving the interests of all the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>The atrocities of 11 September are likely to have a great impact on the Irish economy. Already we have seen the difficulties created in the aviation and tourism sectors. The predictions for other sectors are not good, given the reality that our open economy is heavily influenced by the United States economy. It is, however, important to make the point that the deterioration of the Irish economy did not begin on 11 September, nor was it caused by the events of that day or by other events outside our control. The downturn in the Irish economy was already becoming evident four to five months before the events of 11 September. The Exchequer figures published yesterday confirm that the serious downturn started earlier this year. Its immediate cause has little to do with external factors. It has been brought about by the Government's incompetence and mismanagement.</P>
    <P>The Government has demonstrated extraordinary incompetence in managing Irish economic success. Despite the increase in prosperity, our health system is worse than it was in 1997 and any statements to the contrary by the Taoiseach do not stand up to scrutiny. Waiting lists for many of our flagship hospitals are longer, delays in getting treatment are increasing, medical and nursing staff are under severe pressure and vital services <Col N="102" /> have declined. The Ministers for Health and Children and Finance are in public disagreement, the Tánaiste proposes a solution which has not yet been costed or discussed by the Government and the Taoiseach, as usual, stands back, defends and shows no leadership. This is a failure of management and of Government.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in prosperity, inequalities in our education system are greater than they were in 1997. It has taken court action by some to get the Minister for Education and Science to act. Again, the Taoiseach's leadership was notable by its absence. This is a failure of management and of Government. Secondary education is under threat from the middle of this month. The statement by the Taoiseach today that the Estimates are being drawn up on a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; basis casts serious doubts on the commitment given by the Minister for Education and Science to persons who believe their cases are similar to that of the Sinnott family.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in prosperity, our road and transport systems have dramatically deteriorated. Gridlock is everywhere on our roads and our rail system is a disgrace. Dublin Airport is a painful joke. The Tánaiste was, for once, right in her assertion that we have a Third World infrastructure. This, too, is a failure of management and of Government. There is no leadership, competence or attempt to address the issues. I am reminded of the Guinness advertisement which asks, &ldquo;How did you stand on the surfboard after 15 pints of stout?&rdquo;  The Government was riding the wave of a strong economy, but it is not in control of it and its incompetence is being illustrated now when there is an economic downturn.</P>
    <P>I will not continue to embarrass the Taoiseach with a litany of his failures. Suffice to say that the Government induced weaknesses in our economic performance which have left us vulnerable to the economic aftermath of 11 September. Now that the dark clouds are overhead I hope it is not too late to ask the Taoiseach to take all appropriate steps to protect those sectors of our economy which now find themselves particularly exposed. Tourism and travel are deserving of particular support, not least because they bore the brunt earlier this year of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. It is in the national interest to take all possible measures to ensure the healthy survival of these vital sectors of our economy. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that even if it requires derogations from Brussels, all appropriate measures are taken.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow, in the House, I will deal with Aer Lingus. We face a period of considerable uncertainty on the international political, security and economic fronts. Where the Government's response is effective and well thought out it can be assured of support from the Fine Gael benches. Where we are in agreement with Government policy we will say so and give whatever backing is appropriate. I ask only that the House be kept fully informed and given the opportunity to debate significant moves the Government may <Col N="103" /> feel obliged to take. Where it is necessary to oppose we will do so without apology.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September have shown that no one is immune to the threat of terrorism. Only a concerted response by the world community will enable us to face up to this threat and deal with it. Let us hope that by working together internationally and domestically we can minimise the chances of another such event and deal with its adverse consequences in a way which will lead to the recovery and restructuring of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The world is still reeling from the appalling carnage visited upon New York and Washington on 11 September last. The pure hatred that motivated that appalling crime against humanity has stunned the world. Tuesday, 11 September 2001 is a day that no one will forget. The images of that day are seared on the minds of people across the world. Since this House last came together to respond to that act of terrorism the real human cost has emerged. Over 6,000 families have lost a loved one. Our thoughts and sympathies go out to them as they try to piece together their shattered lives.</P>
      <P>The strong historic and family ties that this country has with America and with the city of New York, in particular, have, if anything, been made stronger by this horrific attack. It is a small, but significant example of the futility of terrorism. It is a clear demonstration of how humanity rises above the hatred and fanaticism of a small self-appointed gang of murderers and finds common cause in adversity.</P>
      <P>The citizens of this island have shown common cause with the people of New York and Washington, and with those who lost their lives aboard the plane that crashed in Pennslyvania. They have responded with revulsion to the attack on innocent civilians, going about their day's business. There can be no room for ambiguity in terms of our condemnation of this murderous assault on the United States.</P>
      <P>It is now three weeks since terrorists unleashed their evil plot over the skies of New York and Washington. To date the response of the United States to this barbarity has been rational and restrained. One could understand a nation and a people so brutally attacked wishing to strike out, yearning for retaliation. Wiser counsel has prevailed and it is to be hoped a more targeted and ultimately more effective response can now be agreed and implemented.</P>
      <P>There is a challenge facing the rest of the world. There should be no revenge at this attack. Revenge will debase us. The challenge facing us is far greater.</P>
      <P>Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, said to his Labour Party conference yesterday:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe their memorial can and should be greater than simply the punishment of the guilty. It is that out of the shadow of evil should emerge lasting good, destruction of machinery of terrorism wherever it is found, hope amongst <Col N="104" /> all nations of a new beginning where we seek to resolve differences in a calm and ordered way, greater understanding between nations and between faiths and above all justice and prosperity for the poor and dispossessed, so that people everywhere can see the chance of a better future through the hard work and creative power of the free citizen, not the violence and savagery of the fanatic.</P>
    <P>These are interesting and appropriate words for they recognise that we, in the West, must change our ways too. They present a challenge to the United States, in particular. They represent a direct call, as I see it, for that country's new policy of unilateralism. It is call on the United States to make common cause with the world, rather than seeing it solely in terms of friends and enemies, black and white. It is a call for an end to the cynical <i>realpolitik </i>of the Kissinger era. It is also a call for proper and full engagement in the United Nations. It must mean the reform of the UN, an organisation which is showing its age, particularly the Security Council, which was established in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War and is in urgent need of reform. Far too much power to veto humanitarian or military action in the name of human rights is in the hands of a single state. People have died as a result, while we sat back and watched. Nothing undermines the authority of the United Nations more than such events. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, will return to this issue in detail later in this debate.</P>
    <P>The enemy faced by the civilised world is chameleon-like and presents few identifiable targets. It operates through a system of sleeper agents that transcend national borders and has the capacity to defy the tools and tactics of conventional armies. An organisation such as that headed by Mr. bin Laden is vulnerable to combined international action on financing, recruitment and other proven anti-terrorist measures. A full-scale military assault, such as that launched by the United States in the wake of the embassy bombings in Sudan and Tanzania, may play directly into the hands of the extremists.</P>
    <P>For the Labour Party, the goals of the new campaign against terrorism are clear. Those who planned and assisted in the perpetration of this brutal crime must be identified and brought before a court of law to face justice. The organisation which provided the infrastructural support and the ideological rationale for the assault must be pursued in every corner of the globe, its leaders and lieutenants brought to book and the organisation itself rendered useless. We have espoused key principles that must inform the response to this barbarity. It should be remembered that principles, centred on the protection of innocent life and adhering to the standards of international law are two key areas that divide the civilised world from the band of fanatics that launched this attack.</P>
    <P>The danger of unilateral action is that it has the capacity to sunder the broad alliance against <Col N="105" /> a common enemy, created by diplomacy in recent weeks. For many nations, the nature of the response to the attacks on the United States is of critical importance. Any action launched in response to the 11 September attacks should be consistent with the mandate of the UN, so that it may be emphasised as an international response. It is vital that all nations support action against international terrorism.</P>
    <P>There are broader issues at play. Pakistan could suffer significant internal chaos if unilateral action without the broad support of predominately Muslim states is undertaken. Mr. bin Laden, the Taliban and their allies across the region are adept at playing on the fears of local communities. The campaign against terrorism will not be advanced by a military action that alienates large sections of Muslim opinion in the region and presents a propaganda opportunity for terrorists.</P>
    <P>The second principle advocated by the Labour Party is that the protection of civilian life must be foremost in any planned response. At my party's conference last weekend I quoted from an e-mail recently received by a friend from an Afghan man exiled in the United States. The man said it is not that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity, but that they were the first victims of its perpetrators. The Taliban, he said, were a &ldquo;cult of ignorant psychotics&rdquo;. I believe he is right, as the Taliban runs one of the most brutal regimes in the world, without regard for basic human rights or the fundamental tenets of international law. I welcome yesterday's commitment from the British Prime Minister, in his speech to the British Labour Party conference, to support the people of Afghanistan. People outside the West are aware that, as often as not, the actions of the West do not always match its fine words.</P>
    <P>Repression and violence are the hallmarks of the current junta in Kabul. If it were overthrown tomorrow, it would not be a day too soon. We must not, however, equate the Taliban with the people of Afghanistan, who have suffered appallingly during the past 20 years. The devastation inflicted on the country by the Cold War-fuelled civil war, which followed the Soviet invasion, has remained. While thousands of Afghan citizens eke out a miserable existence in refugee camps, even more of them face the prospect of malnutrition and starvation within Afghanistan. The humanitarian crisis facing the Afghan people has been rendered more acute by the terrorist acts of fanatics three weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party criticised the Government's unqualified offer of the use of Irish airports to the American Government. We cannot give a blank cheque for the use of force. Our arguments, as I have stated, are based on both moral and strategic grounds. Let there be no confusion. I share the same goals as enunciated clearly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the United Nations yesterday. I do not believe, however, that unilateral military action, which places the lives of innocent Afghans at risk, should play a part in <Col N="106" /> the international campaign against terrorism. The Government was wrong to offer this blank cheque, especially as it did so without either informing or debating the proposal in this House. There was an opportunity to do so when we returned for a special debate to express sympathy to the people of the United States.</P>
    <P>While the Labour Party has been critical of this aspect of Government policy, it fully supports other initiatives taken since 11 September. In particular, I fully supported the Taoiseach's recent visit to the Islamic community in Dublin. The attacks on the United States had nothing to do with religion. They were a world away from the rich and proud history that Islam has brought to this world, especially to European civilisation. Unfortunately, a tiny minority in society are so blinded by prejudice that they cannot see this reality. The Taoiseach did a good day's work by meeting and supporting the Muslim community in Ireland at this trying time.</P>
    <P>The diplomatic challenge faced by the Government centres on Ireland's presidency of the UN Security Council. There has probably never been a more critical time for the UN in living memory, so our role is of vital importance. We should use our position to retain the broadest possible support against terrorism and to ensure that future actions have the backing of the United Nations. The scale of the attack on the United States has implications across the globe. Concerns about a global economic downturn and the implications for airline companies are two which come to mind. Later this week the Dáil will debate the situation faced by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>There is one impact on Ireland to which I wish to draw attention. One of the most soul-destroying experiences of my life was to see the scourge of heroin take a grip on working class communities in Dublin during the 1980s. It was no coincidence that the widespread availability of heroin on the streets of Dublin and every other city in western Europe coincided with the civil strife which followed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the forced exile of the Shah of Iran. Opium is a cash crop and its mass production financed disparate bands of rebels and profiteers when civil society collapsed in Afghanistan. Iran provided a route for this heroin out of the region and onto the streets of our cities. There is a real danger that the current turmoil in Afghanistan will again result in western Europe being flooded by cheap heroin. It is truly a global trade. We have already lost too many lives to this pernicious drug to allow another generation become addicted. I urge the Government to refocus the efforts of the Garda and the Customs and Excise on stemming the tide of heroin that reaches our shores and causes havoc in communities where it takes a grip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>Three weeks after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsyl<Col N="107" /> vania, shock and disbelief have given way to a mixture of outrage and deep sadness. The magnitude of the carnage is difficult to absorb. That we do not yet have a definitive death toll speaks for itself. When he visited ground zero in New York, my colleague, Deputy Cowen, confirmed that television cannot encapsulate the sheer horror of 6,300 people buried in the carnage of a site which is a graveyard. The world and its history were changed before our eyes in just 30 minutes on the morning of 11 September. We have known a fair share of wanton destruction and dastardly attacks on human life in this country. Our hearts have gone out to the victims, their relatives and friends and to the American people whose friendship we have always cherished. As time passes we hear more and more personal tales of tragedy, of fortunate escapes and of examples of enormous bravery. We can only imagine the horror and the suffering involved. The real solidarity displayed on our day of national mourning is testament to just how important the links between this country and the USA have been for generations past and for the present generation in terms of the importance of US investment in our country today.</P>
      <P>Ireland is seeking to play its part in efforts to respond to the immediate terrorist threat by co-operating in police investigations and by opening our airspace and airports to aircraft operation in pursuit of UN Resolution 1368. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said yesterday, Ireland is not neutral in the struggle against international terrorism.</P>
      <P>The worldwide economic repercussions of 11 September are still being assessed. It is still too early to estimate a value of the losses to our tourism industry but there is no doubt the impact will be substantial in the short-term at least. In March this year I spoke here about the possible devastating impact on tourism if foot and mouth disease had spread to this country. Back then I thought that was the biggest setback that could befall the tourism industry, at least in one year. Unfortunately, just six months later we are facing potentially a far more serious threat to our fastest growing market.</P>
      <P>Last year, Irish tourism generated £2.26 billion in foreign revenue and provided jobs for 150,000 people. Of the six million tourists we welcomed here, 1.1 million came from the United States, earning almost 700 million euro for our economy last year, 25% of our total tourism earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 300,000 US visitors would have been expected to holiday here in the last four months of the current year and already Bord Fáilte expects considerably less than half this number to travel. The 2002 performance will depend on the US response to the attacks and its aftermath but in the light of the reaction by air carriers over the past three weeks we can expect a dramatic fall off in US visitor numbers next year and an inevitable knock-on effect on air travel generally across all markets. Our experience of the Gulf War at the <Col N="108" /> beginning of the last decade suggests that it could take as long as three years to recover that market.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in the decade since the Gulf War, Ireland as a tourism destination has been strongly established in the United States market. This was achieved through highly effective marketing and dedicated effort over the years by Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and more recently by US carriers serving Ireland. In that context and bearing in mind the strength and resilience of the US economy we must think in terms of recovery and that is why we must maintain our presence in that market and prepare for better times. In particular, the maintenance of existing US gateways, developed at considerable expense over the years by Aer Lingus and other airlines, is critical to our performance in the immediate and long-term. My Department and Bord Fáilte are working with the Department of Public Enterprise and the air carriers to identify air routes of greatest strategic importance for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>However, there is no doubt that the recent terrorist attacks will lead to the first annual decline in visitor numbers for more than a decade. In the coming weeks we will need to monitor the nature, extent and duration of the response to this terrible atrocity and gauge what further impact it may have on people travelling. Unlike the foot and mouth crisis there is no incubation period, no date after which we can give the all clear and no specific deadline to start the recovery process. The fact is that at present Americans are afraid to fly and we do not know how long it will take for confidence in air travel to be regained. We must be patient and position ourselves to take advantage of the inevitable recovery, whenever it happens.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, given the changed environment, it is vitally important that there is a root and branch reassessment of our tourism marketing strategies, including how and where we focus business, so that the substantial Exchequer funding already allocated for this area under the national development plan has maximum impact. In the short-term we will need to increase our focus on Britain, continental Europe and of course the domestic market. This work is now under way.</P>
    <P>Since 11 September, both I and officials of my Department have met senior management of both Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all island tourism marketing company, and a high level delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, to take stock of the situation. Last Thursday, Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited confirmed that it was urgently re-examining, in consultation with the tourism industry and through the Tourism Marketing Partnership structure, their respective marketing programmes and plans for the remainder of 2001 and for 2002. Bord Fáilte announced a £750,000 programme of additional immediate measures for the British and Irish markets. Meanwhile, the new chief executive of Tourism Ireland Limited is already spearheading the review of <Col N="109" /> marketing plans for 2002 with the intention of making a major announcement early next month in conjunction with the launch of a new advertising campaign for the island of Ireland. These moves have been welcomed by ITIC.</P>
    <P>The Government is also very conscious of the important link between competitive air access and future tourism flows. An interdepartmental working group of senior officials which met today is considering options and proposals that would promote low cost access. The Government is happy to look at all proposals from the aviation sector that will give access to new markets. Given the changed circumstances, it is also important that we bed down as a matter of urgency the process of institutional change now under way in the tourism State agencies which have remained unchanged in structure since the early 1960s. It is also crucial that an orderly handover of responsibility to Tourism Ireland Limited is completed well in time for the 2002 marketing season. I welcome the initial positive expression of support from the Council of CERT and the board of Bord Fáilte to the proposed creation of a new integrated tourism development agency. My intention is that we have in place strong structures to implement our medium term plans for international marketing, product and human resource development, as contained in the national development plan, to help the tourism industry meet the major challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector is characterised by its partnership approach to the development of the industry. Its success over the past ten years is in no small part due to that partnership approach. Most recently that partnership dealt very effectively with the foot and mouth crisis. I am confident the same approach will see this most resilient of industries through these most challenging times.</P>

He should recall that when he was Minister for Health and Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, they cut investment in the waiting lists from £12 million to £8 <Col N="110" /> million in their short period in power. Can the people of this country possibly trust the Deputy on the issue of health? That is the question the people will have to answer at the next general election. They have set themselves up on pedestals as angels of some sort, but the Irish people must decide who to trust to bring them through this era of turbulence. Would they prefer a competent Government to incompetent angels? I believe they would prefer the former, as they have indicated over the past four years.</P>

      <P>It is important that we do more than express our support for and sympathy and solidarity with the American people and all those involved in the fight against international terrorism. There is a danger that we will simply make the right noises and consider that to be sufficient. There is also a danger that we will feel we have played our part through our chairmanship of the UN Security Council. There is a duty and responsibility on all countries to do what they can to ensure those responsible for the horrific acts of violence of 11 September are brought to justice and we must do all we can within our domestic jurisdictions to prevent further acts of terrorism. The Government will be judged in accordance with these criteria, not on its fine words and flowery phrases.</P>
      <P>On the issue of making our airport and intelligence facilities available, it would have been utterly ridiculous for Ireland to have been the only country in the western world not to share such facilities in the fight against international terrorism. Such a course of action would have been quite unacceptable. However, the Government is to be criticised for the almost casual manner in which the Taoiseach made the announcement on this serious matter. I do not concur with those who state that the decision necessitated a Dáil motion pursuant to Article 28.3.1º of the Constitution as we were not involved in a declaration of war and were not participating in any war. A special sitting of the Dáil was convened on 18 September and it was entirely inappropriate that the Taoiseach did not outline his intention to make these facilities available during his address on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement should have been made as part of a package outlining our areas of priority in dealing with this international crisis. I made it clear that I wanted to see a major focus on the humanitarian aspect of this crisis and welcome yesterday's announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell. I hope it marks the spearheading of an approach to dealing with the humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan. We must also focus on the sequestration of assets and <Col N="111" /> I have promoted the establishment of an international criminal assets bureau in which I hope Ireland will be instrumental.</P>
    <P>We must identify the action we ourselves can take to address these matters and the Government has been found wanting in this regard. Flowery prose is not sufficient. Last June, the people of Ireland approved the establishment of an international criminal court, provided the necessary constitutional framework was made available. Legislation is required for us to ratify the court's establishment. On 27 June, I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to which he replied that the necessary implementing legislation was being prepared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and would have to be passed by the Oireachtas. He stated that the early ratification of the Statute of Rome to enable Ireland to ratify the court remained a priority for his Department. One would think that such a priority would result in the inclusion of the necessary legislation in the Government's legislative programme published after 11 September at a time when one might have expected that priority to be heightened.</P>
    <P>The legislative programme is divided into three parts, the first of which outlines Bills expected to be published before Christmas, but the implementing legislation is not included therein. The second section outlines the heads of Bills approved by Government for which texts are in preparation and it is expected that this legislation will be published in 2002, but the required legislation is not included in this section either. The final section treats of 57 Bills for which heads have yet to be approved by the Government, but, again, the legislation in question is not included. By its fruits shall the Government be known. There is popular support for the ratification of the Statute of Rome to enable the establishment of the International Criminal Court, but the Government has not taken the necessary legislative steps to facilitate this. I demand this be done as it is the very least we should do at this stage.</P>
    <P>I want to address the reports that associates of Osama bin Laden were issued with Irish passports under the passports for sale scheme. I feel very strongly about the abuses which occurred under this scheme between 1988 and 1994 which I have highlighted on many occasions. I have made it clear that the law was flouted in the issuance of such passports until 1994 when Máire Geoghegan-Quinn took over as Minister for Justice and issued guidelines on passports which were subsequently followed. I want to know how Sheikh Mahfouz was issued with 11 passports during that period. No satisfactory answer has been provided to this question and it is now all the more critical that this issue be addressed in the light of the fact that this man is a brother-in-law and associate of bin Laden's. I want to know the circumstances in which the passports were issued and whether they have been withdrawn. <Col N="112" /> I also want to know whether the naturalisation processes have been rescinded.</P>
    <P>We will discuss the issues confronting us in greater detail in coming months. The Government will be judged on the actions it takes in response to this crisis. The Government must define what it means by &ldquo;international terrorism&rdquo;.  To me, terrorism is the same whether it occurs in Omagh, County Louth &ndash; where arms dumps will ultimately be located &ndash; or Canary Wharf. We must pursue the fight against domestic terrorism, republican or loyalist, to the ultimate degree. I mention the loyalists, in particular, arising from the recent murder of Martin O'Hagan. I am concerned that at times people appear to have a sneaking regard for those involved in terrorism. That was certainly the case in the past, although I hope it is no longer true. We must be absolutely clear that terrorism of any kind is unacceptable, a view endorsed by the Irish people in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>The issue of neutrality was referred to. There is great ambiguity on this matter, particularly in the Fianna Fáil Party. The time is ripe when those ambiguities should be resolved and it is now opportune for the Government to issue a White Paper on the matter. I will conclude on that point and leave the remaining five minutes to my colleague, Deputy Coveney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for sharing his time with me. The shock, the horror, the anger and the deep sense of sadness that most people in Ireland have felt since the US atrocities of 11 September will make that day an unforgettable one for us. The scale and impact of the world's most powerful, prosperous and secure nation being attacked in its capital and commercial centre by such a grotesque and barbarous act of terror against innocent people, quite simply numbed me as in disbelief I watched events unfold on live television. People in Ireland have shared some of the grief, given the loss of life of Irish citizens, including cousins of a member of my political party. With generosity of spirit our people have express sympathy to all American families that have suffered loss or injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three weeks have now passed since this attack. In this house we have a responsibility to show leadership and direction in how we should respond to the events of 11 September. America and her military allies have declared war on international terrorism. However, I am relieved they have shown restraint, so far, and are considering an appropriate and effective response with set goals and targets. Clearly there is an acceptance at present among NATO members that the building of a world alliance in the fight against terrorism is all important and that the slaughter of innocent civilians in any military response may add to suffering and to the threat of further terrorist activity rather than reducing it. A US policy of restraint and caution has resulted in a move away from a situation whereby a clash between <Col N="113" /> east and west, or Islam verses the democratic world, could develop into a reality that certain evil people would wish for.</P>
    <P>In this context, Ireland can play an important role, as the country holding the chair of the UN Security Council for the next month. The Security Council has already passed a resolution, unequivocal in its condemnation of the attacks, which stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or protecting the people responsible for these atrocities must be held to account. Any country or group of countries has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter, and the US clearly intends to do this by declaring war on terrorism. However, Ireland's role can be a significant one. As chair of the UN Security Council, we can promote co-operation and consensus building between nations, which is all important to ensure that internationally acceptable decisions are taken in the response to this atrocity. I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen, well in his crucial role as chairperson and I can assure him of very constructive support and advice from my party, should he look for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement this evening, outlining Ireland's commitments to co-operate with international efforts to seize funds used to sponsor terrorist groups. I also welcome the fact that we have decided to offer the US military the use of Irish airports for refuelling. However I would have been more comfortable with this decision if it had been debated in detail by this House before a decision was made.</P>
    <P>Along with our international obligations, the tragic events in the US also require leadership at home on this island. We must ensure that the 15,000 strong Islamic community, for example, is not victimised because of ignorant or biased attitudes in certain people who may link them to events in the US because of their skin colour or religious beliefs.</P>
    <P>In relation to terrorism itself, unfortunately we are all too familiar with the destruction, hatred and deep sorrow which is the result of terrorist activity in pursuit of an objective. There is no longer an acceptable or credible argument that can be made which promotes the continued existence of private armies in a functioning democratic state such as ours. Political parties backed up or supported by private armed groups need to make a choice now. We voted, North and South, in the Good Friday Agreement, to reject emphatically the further use of violence in pursuit of political objectives. If we have learned anything from the tragedy and pain in the US it is that the distinction can no longer be made between freedom-fighter and terrorist in a free and democratic state such as the one we live in. I appeal to those in political parties linked to armed paramilitaries, whether they be loyalist or republican, many of whom I believe are committed to a new way and to democracy, to break those links and to encourage the decommissioning of arms. Perhaps then the very dark <Col N="114" /> clouds of 11 September will have a small but very significant silver lining for this small island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. In the aftermath of the appalling attacks against the people of the United States, the protracted humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan has received renewed international attention. The world is now having to contend with a crisis of international terrorism, on the one hand, alongside a looming humanitarian disaster.</P>
      <P>In focusing on the humanitarian dimension, we should recognise that there have been many contributory factors and that these date from long before 11 September and its aftermath. Twenty-three years of conflict have been aggravated by the last three years of severe drought. This has created a legacy of suffering, uprooted families, human rights abuse, poverty and starvation for the Afghan people. Even without the repercussions of the dark events of 11 September, the prospects for these people were being worsened by a threat of nature that is the oncoming bleak winter during which temperatures plummet to below minus fifteen degrees and entire localities become inaccessible. The international community effectively has until the middle of November to put the necessary emergency stocks in place before winter sets in. We must reinvigorate our efforts of last year when wide-scale starvation was averted through the assistance which Ireland and other donors provided. It is essential that we build rapidly on the incremental success of aid agencies, including Irish NGOs, in restoring essential food supplies to Kabul and other locations. In briefing the Minister for Foreign Affairs last Monday in New York, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that three to five million people are likely to starve unless food supplies get through in the near future.</P>
      <P>In early September, the World Food Programme launched a US$151 million appeal to meet existing emergency needs and the onset of winter in Afghanistan. More than 700,000 people were already uprooted within the country, with in excess of 3 million more scattered into neighbouring countries. These figures have been increasing. We know, from the work of Irish NGOs and other aid agencies whom Ireland Aid supports that families have been struggling to survive in Afghanistan and selling essential items such as blankets and livestock to obtain basic food items or seed. This means that families have already undermined their ability to survive the harshness of winter in their struggle to survive the drought of summer. In purely material terms, therefore, their ability to cope with the adversities of winter is already diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been responding with continued emergency assistance. The package of £2.8 million which the Government announced this week is the biggest ever for a single emer<Col N="115" /> gency. This reflects the enormous gravity of this crisis. It reflects also the importance which the Government and Irish people attach to finding a lasting solution to this protracted humanitarian tragedy. Last October, we decided to support the work of the World Food Programme, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent and Christian Aid Ireland in Afghanistan and to give ongoing priority to what was then called a forgotten emergency. We provided initially £1.6 million in support of emergency programmes and this week we have added £2.8 million. This brings our assistance to Afghanistan to a total of £4 million during 2001. These accumulated responses are a tangible expression of our international humanitarian commitment. They represent a determined effort on our part to address the acute humanitarian problem. We are seeking to do this in a manner which, in co-operation with the international donor community, can be of enduring benefit for all the people of Afghanistan and can help to build a lasting peace and stability there.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the United Nations, Red Cross, Red Crescent and Irish NGO communities which have maintained their humanitarian commitment to Afghanistan, even during those times when their work went largely unnoticed. The Government is happy to have been able to support them in that endeavour and to be able to help them in meeting the latest challenges which they face in delivering help to those who most need it. The latest aid package is divided equally between NGOs, including GOAL, Trócaire, Christian Aid Ireland and Concern, and the international UN and Red Cross agencies.</P>
    <P>Our aid continues to meet a broad range of immediate, basic needs, including emergency feeding and drought assistance, mine victim support, health, water and sanitation. This aid is aimed not only at those at risk within Afghanistan, but also at those refugees gathering on the borders. The emergency assistance unit of Ireland Aid is in regular contact with those NGOs and members of the UN and Red Cross families which are being funded. These implementing partners are also being given additional flexibility to make the Irish response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan all the more effective. The gradual return of international aid workers who had been relocated for safety reasons is warmly welcomed and the Government will make every effort to ensure they can continue to do their work in safety. Along with the gradual resumption of food supplies, this has the potential to restore the effectiveness of those programmes which local supporting staff had, with inspiring courage, been striving to maintain in the absence of the foreign workers.</P>
    <P>The Government is taking all appropriate action to support an effective humanitarian response to the ongoing needs of the people of Afghanistan which can have lasting effect. The main priorities of this strategy are: resuming <Col N="116" /> essential food and other supplies to the hundreds of thousands at risk within the country; ensuring essential aid gets to those in most need before winter and that those delivering it have unimpeded and unhindered access; and keeping borders open in order that aid agencies and their staff can respond effectively to any deepening of the refugee crisis.</P>
    <P>In addition to pursuing these issues bilaterally and at UN level, the Government will also raise them at the special meeting of EU Development Ministers which has been called for l0 October. This will discuss how the European Union can best respond to humanitarian needs in Afghanistan and how development support can create the necessary conditions for a lasting, inclusive peace in that country.</P>
    <P>Some 4 million in humanitarian relief has been made available by the European Commission. This is in addition to that being made available by Ireland and other member states and to the 23.3 million already provided by the Commission this year. This represents a total commitment by the European Commission of 27.3 million so far this year.</P>
    <P>The World Food Programme appeal which was made in early September recognised that well over five million people were at risk. During this week's meetings of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, with key humanitarian players in New York even higher figures were being quoted. To put this in perspective, this would be an emergency five times that of the refugee crisis which arose in Goma following the appalling genocide perpetrated in Rwanda in 1994. This would, as then, have enormous regional and international repercussions.</P>
    <P>Having been there for those suffering in the Great Lakes region during that terrible crisis, post-genocide, it is only right that we should be there for those innocent people suffering in Afghanistan as we try to resolve the first major international crisis of the new millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The brutality and wickedness of the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September were an affront to humanity. It is very difficult, so close to the event, to assess the full economic impact of the terrorist attacks in the United States. However, one thing is clear. The short-term impact will be to reduce economic activity, both globally and in Ireland. It will add to economic uncertainty and volatility for the period ahead.</P>
      <P>Even before the terrorist attacks, the major world economies, the United States, the European Union and Japan, had already slowed significantly. Commentators have remarked that this was the first time since 1982 that all three major economic areas were underperforming at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the impact on the US economy of the attacks will be substantial. However, the extent and duration of the impact on the United States will depend heavily on the <Col N="117" /> effect on US consumer confidence. The latest figures from the United States show a continued fall in consumer confidence there.</P>
    <P>Oil prices are also likely to play an important role in the world economic outlook. While Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have both given assurances that any disruptions to oil supplies will be neutralised, if oil prices were to rise sharply, then this would have a negative impact on all the economies of the world.</P>
    <P>Due to these uncertainties and the unknown impact on the world economy of any military response, commentators differ on how long any potential rebound in the United States might be delayed. However, it is not expected before mid-2002 at the earliest.</P>
    <P>As regards the impact of the attacks on Europe, a slowing of economic growth must be anticipated. However, the effect is likely to be less severe in the European Union than elsewhere in order that it can return to sustainable growth levels. The increasingly open nature of the Irish economy has, if anything, made us more dependent on developments in the world economy than before. Therefore, by impacting on the world economy, the terrorist attacks will obviously have unfavourable implications for us.</P>
    <P>We, in Ireland, had already expected to be affected by the US slowdown. The latest tax figures published yesterday confirm that the Irish economy is slowing. Tax inflows to the end of September show an increase of 2.2% over receipts in the same period last year compared to a budget target of 12.5% over the 2000 outturn.</P>
    <P>The main effect of the US developments will be felt in 2002. Private sector leading indicators, tax revenue and housing data had already indicated that there would be a reduced carry-over of growth from 2001 into 2002. The main channels through which the Irish economy will be affected will be exports and investment.</P>
    <P>As regards exports, the United States accounts for almost 18% of our exports and there is no doubt that our exports to the United States will be affected. If we regard tourism as an export, the effect on Irish exports will be greater still. A key risk to the export outlook would be a sharp and significant fall in the value of the dollar and sterling against the euro which, if it occurred, would impact on our competitiveness at a time when wage increases remain high. The US slowdown had already led to some weakening of the dollar and sterling against the euro. Continued weakening of the dollar and sterling would make Irish exports less competitive and reduce export growth further. That is the reason we must ensure wage and cost developments generally do not add to our exposure on the competitiveness front. We need to adapt our expectations to the new economic environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out the obvious in that if the dollar and sterling were to weaken against the euro or if the euro was to appreciate against the dollar and sterling &ndash; whichever way one wants to look at it &ndash; that, too, would have a negative impact on Irish exports.</P>
      <P>Foreign direct investment from the United States, in particular, has been one of the main driving forces behind our record growth rates of recent years. Employment in IDA assisted firms represents 8.5% of total employment. The ICT sector is also of particular importance for Ireland as it accounted for almost 40% of Irish exports and 6% of total employment in 2000. Job losses had already been increasing significantly in this sector before the US terrorist attacks. We had already expected a reduction and delay of foreign direct investment and a negative impact on the ICT sector due to the slowdown in the United States. The attacks on 11 September will now only further reduce and delay investment from there.</P>
      <P>As regards the impact of the attacks on Irish inflation, in the short term weaker global demand and lower Irish growth can be expected to have a dampening effect on inflation here. Interest rates and oil prices have already come down. If the global downturn were to be accompanied by a depreciation of the dollar and sterling against the euro or further reductions in euro area interest rates, there would also be further beneficial implications for inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growth in Ireland this year will be lower than had been previously forecast, both this year and <Col N="119" /> in 2002. The resulting lower tax receipts will reduce our room for manoeuvre on the budgetary front. Recent events underline the need for a prudent approach to the public finances, particularly over coming months in order to ensure the economy weathers the present global difficulties. However, I have no doubt that the Irish economy is in good condition and that with the right approach we can pass through the short-term difficulties with which the global environment has presented us. I am confident that in the medium term, as the global economic environment improves, we can return to acceptable levels of economic growth which will benefit all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the United States last week. I believe the American people are willing to make very large sacrifices in their attempt to eliminate terrorism. The initial feelings of vengeance that were voiced by some politicians have subsided and have been replaced by a quiet, deliberate determination. The outpouring of American patriotism is truly impressive to behold. There is a sense of a coming together among the American people, based on their allegiance to their institutions, which is truly admirable.</P>
      <P>This is no Vietnam, there is none of the moral doubt that existed about that war from its outset. There is, however, among many thinking Americans, a considerable remaining doubt about the exact war aims that are being pursued in this war. Is it directed only against those responsible for these attacks and their accomplices? Is it directed against all terrorist networks &ndash; including those uninvolved with the 11 September attack, or is its further objective one of changing the Government of Afghanistan? I am not sure that the American people are yet clear as to whether all three objectives are America's war aims or whether only the first objective applies.</P>
      <P>War aims must be clear from the outset if the country waging the war is not to sink into a bog as casualties mount. Broadening war aims to include all terrorist networks, including those not involved on 11 September, could involve attacks on a long list of countries. The United Nations Security Council's Resolution 1368 calls on states to bring the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks to justice. That is clear. The resolution also calls on those responsible for harbouring or aiding the perpetrators to be &ldquo;held accountable&rdquo;. That is not quite so clear. The latter part of the resolution is the presumed legal justification for military attacks on Afghanistan, if these are to take place, and for Ireland making its airports available to that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Authoritative evidence should be made public as to the involvement of bin Laden with the attack on America. In his speech yesterday, the Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, referred to evidence involving bin Laden with other terrorist attacks, but did not produce evidence in regard to this attack. It is clear that bin Laden is being harboured by the Taliban regime, but for an <Col N="120" /> attack on Afghanistan to be justified the evidence of his involvement with the 11 September attacks should be made public first. Protecting sources is not a sufficient excuse for not making the information public.</P>
    <P>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 sets out an attempt at a global response to global terrorism. It contains an agenda of action &ndash; including exchange of information, actions to prevent terrorism, and ways to deal with asylum seekers in that context &ndash; and establishes a committee to report back to the Security Council within 90 days. The resolution, however, does not deal with three important matters. It does not deal with the harmonisation of extradition rules, it does not contain a definition of terrorism, either in legal or political terms, and it does not deal with the failure of some countries to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court or to ratify existing conventions on terrorism. The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should use their position on the United Nations Security Council to remedy these deficiencies in Resolution 1373 at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>If we have no definition of terrorism, how can we wage war against it? If we have no common extradition rules, how can we interpret the words of the UN resolution relating to harbouring the perpetrators of the attack of 11 September 2001? These are real questions to which answers should be made available by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, yesterday told the Taliban it should surrender the terrorists or surrender power. That is a very succinct war aim. However, it suggests that Britain at least is prepared to become involved in the Afghan civil war if bin Laden is not surrendered. This could be a long war. The terrain is unfavourable to the sort of intervention on the ground that would be necessary to make the Taliban surrender power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn of the Labour Party has said that he opposes the granting of use of our airports to United States forces. His position is very different to that of Mr. Tony Blair. Ireland should grant use of its airports but, while it may not be legally required to do so, the Government should do so on the basis of a resolution adopted by this House which would set out in explicit terms the war aims Ireland is prepared to support. In this instance, there are war aims we should support and we should support them perhaps to an even greater degree than merely granting the use of our airports. We should support a war to achieve the extradition of the 11 September attackers and their accomplices. However, the inclusion of wider aims such as dismantling terrorist networks not involved in the events of 11 September is premature. In addition, changing the Government of Afghanistan is not an appropriate war aim on its own account.</P>
    <P>We should put our own house in order before we emote about terrorism in other parts of the world. The retention by the IRA of its private <Col N="121" /> arsenal, in defiance of the will of the people and as a continuing threat to others, is terrorism by any definition. The Irish Government and security forces now know the location of the IRA's arms. If these are not handed over in the five week period remaining after the suspension of the institutions, they should be seized by the Garda and the Army. It is simply not acceptable that IRA arsenals should be tolerated on the sovereign territory of this State. The existence of such arsenals &ndash; regardless of whether the weapons they contain are currently in use &ndash; is, in itself, a terrorist threat. Our security forces know the location of these weapons and they should go and get them if the IRA does not hand them over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday evening I stood on ground zero in lower Manhattan, New York. Up until three weeks ago, this had been the site of one of the great landmark buildings of the world; a centre of global enterprise with an international work force, a commercial united nations. What I saw, through the hazy smoke of the fires which still burned below ground, was an enormous mound of twisted steel and broken rubble under which were buried the bodies of more than 5,000 human beings.</P>
      <P>It was for me a traumatic, emotional and deeply saddening experience. Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer immensity of the destruction to property but even far more shocking was that on this spot, on that terrible Tuesday morning, thousands of innocent people going about their daily business had been slaughtered in the name of an evil hatred.</P>
      <P>More than three weeks on from the attacks, the scale of the devastation is still only being guessed at. Estimates of the number of people killed in the World Trade Center are still imprecise. The figures are being revised downwards but, sadly, not by much. The number of Irish casualties is still not known precisely. My Department currently lists five confirmed Irish fatalities with eight people still missing. Sadly, other Irish citizens, not yet notified to us, may have been caught up in the tragedy.</P>
      <P>There were, tragically, very many Irish-American casualties of this atrocity. The human aspect of its impact on the Irish-American community was brought home forcefully and poignantly to me last Sunday when I attended the memorial service at the Holy Trinity Church on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The congregation, made up of Irish, Americans, and those who are proud to be both, was united in its grief as the names of the dead and missing were individually called out in the church by their families and friends. I have never felt the bonds between our two countries more strongly and I assured the congregation, on behalf of all of us, that Ireland stood solidly with them at this terrible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout my visit to New York and Washington, I was particularly touched by the heartfelt appreciation of the immense and ongoing efforts <Col N="122" /> of the staff of our consulate general in New York, our embassy in Washington and consulate general in Boston to assist Irish citizens caught up in the terrible events. I had the opportunity to thank them in person on behalf of the Government and I know that the House will wish to join me in acknowledging their contribution which is in the best tradition of the Irish public service.</P>
    <P>What happened in the United States on 11 September 2001 has truly global implications which affect each and every one of us in one way or other. At the most immediate level, we have the sense of living in a less secure world. Nobody can guarantee that the terrorists will not attack again. Nobody can say with any certainty where any future attacks would be targeted. Nobody can predict what means of attack the terrorist might use. Those who appear to be behind the attacks of 11 September have struck at targets in a number of different countries, with no regard to the number or nationality of those who they murdered.</P>
    <P>We are already beginning to feel the tangible economic impact of what took place on 11 September. Business confidence has been shaken, international travel has fallen off and in Ireland, the tourism industry has experienced the direct impact of the atrocity. Given the commitment of the United States and its friends not to give in to terrorism or to give comfort to those who would seek to terrorise them, I hope they will show the necessary resilience in bringing things back to normality as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>However, there is a less obvious but more fundamental implication for what has happened. The international community has experienced a direct assault on the universal freedoms and values on which our increasingly global society is based. The terrorists who struck on 11 September exploited many of these freedoms &ndash; freedom to travel, freedom to seek employment, freedom of financial movements &ndash; to build up their networks for their attack on the free world.</P>
    <P>The international community has no option but to respond to this challenge to our security, our prosperity and our fundamental freedoms and values. In doing so, we must seek to uphold these freedoms and values and, thereby, bring stark relief to the differences which divide those who uphold our values and those, hiding in our midst, who would seek to destroy them.</P>
    <P>The Government will ensure that Ireland plays a part commensurate with its commitment to an international order based on liberty, justice, respect for human rights and the rule of law. This carries a particularly direct responsibility during October when we hold the Presidency of the UN Security Council. My primary purpose in travelling to Washington and New York last week was for detailed discussions, in advance of our Presidency, with members of the Council and others on how we can address the urgent challenges which confront us.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, when I addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations, I argued that <Col N="123" /> the fight against international terrorism needs to take place on three levels. First, as member states of the United Nations, we must do all we can, in accordance with Resolution 1368, to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of the attacks of 11 September and to prevent further such atrocities. Second, we must combine in a longer-term initiative to defeat the monster of international terrorism by choking its funds, cutting its supply of munitions and technical support and denying it the bases from which it plans and prepares its actions. Third, we must redouble our efforts to put an end to the many conflicts and injustices, which, while they can never, ever justify the horrors of 11 September, are exploited by the terrorists to garner support for their warped philosophies.</P>
    <P>As I said in this House on 18 September, we must restore the primacy of the concept of compromise. Where compromise is absent, conflict, violence, misery and death occur. I am convinced that no other way offers us the potential to make significant progress in the many disputes which plague our world, whether they are in the Middle East, the Balkans or in African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi. This search for a spirit of compromise is at the core of our approach to conflict resolution.</P>
    <P>Since 11 September, we are in a different world. The political, economic, financial and humanitarian impacts are already being felt world wide. There are few certainties any more. We have been challenged as never before to produce a new and better world, a world where our guiding principles of justice and peace have surely been reinforced, albeit through a tragedy of appalling proportions. We must now focus, in common and collective action, on the fight against the scourge of terrorism. The Security Council moved quickly and effectively to respond to these challenges, through its Resolutions 1368 and 1373.</P>
    <P>During my visit to the US I met many determined people ranging from political leaders and diplomats to firemen and police officers. I took great comfort and strength from their determination. If the international community can find the collective resolve, it can use this opportunity to reinvigorate the system of international co-operation. We can bring about just solutions to the conflicts which scar our world and bring justice to those who struggle to maintain their very existence.</P>
    <P>The European Council which met on 21 September gave a clear political impetus to confronting the challenge of terrorism. Urgent work is under way in various Council formations to evolve concrete measures for consideration and adoption by the European Council in Laeken next December. European Union dialogue with the US is being intensified. We are ready, with our partners, to take whatever action is necessary to ensure international peace and security. In this regard, the Government has already decided to <Col N="124" /> accelerate work on the signature and ratification by Ireland of existing international anti-terrorism conventions.</P>
    <P>My meeting with the Secretary of State Colin Powell on 26 September primarily focused on actions to counter terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks on the US, particularly through our joint efforts in the Security Council. We also reviewed the situation in the Middle East and in Iraq. I took the opportunity to update the Secretary of State on the Northern Ireland peace process and to express appreciation for the strong and continuing support of the United States. We both agreed there is an urgent responsibility on all sides to live up to their obligations and to ensure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>Colin Powell expressed his appreciation of Ireland's solidarity and support, reflected in the national day of mourning, &ndash; and in the Government's offer of over flight and other facilities. He offered his condolences in respect of Irish victims of the terrorist attack. For my part, I expressed the profound sorrow and regret of the Irish people at the events of 11 September. I offered the support of Ireland for the efforts of the US Government to build an international coalition to deal comprehensively with international terrorism. I formally conveyed to the Secretary of State the Irish Government's offer of over flight and landing facilities.</P>
    <P>Secretary of State, Mr. Powell, told me the US Government was enormously gratified by the support of bodies such as the Security Council, UN General Assembly, the EU, the organisation of Islamic states and a wide range of countries. Support for the campaign against terrorism would be varied but the US welcomed support according to each country's ability to offer it. The Secretary of State was very clear in his perspective that the international campaign against terrorism would be multi-faceted. He was equally clear that any military response should not be seen as a clash between Islam and the west. The vast majority of Muslims world wide were just as horrified as anyone else at these atrocities.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State, Mr. Powell cited President Bush's determination to engage in a long-term campaign against terrorist networks located in many countries. He regretted the Taliban regime's failure to respond to the demand of the Security Council to hand over Osama bin Laden. He assured me that if military force is used, it will be careful and calibrated. I emphasised to the Secretary the imperative, as Ireland saw it, that any military response be measured, proportional and avoid as far as possible the risk of inflicting civilian casualties.</P>
    <P>It might be useful to recall the comments of UN Secretary General Annan yesterday when he was asked if more consultations were needed before any US military strike. The Secretary General said that the Security Council resolution had described the attack as a threat to international <Col N="125" /> peace and security and had reaffirmed the right of individual and collective self-defence. Mr. Powell also fully acknowledged the concern of the entire international community with regard to the humanitarian situation. He noted that the US was the largest contributor to the humanitarian relief efforts in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>During my visit to the UN, I held discussions with the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, other senior UN officials, heads of delegation of other SECCO members and heads of the UN oil-for-food and office of Iraq programmes. Following on from Resolution 1368 of 12 September, the Security Council on 28 September unanimously adopted Resolution 1373 after two days of negotiation. The resolution imposes obligations on member states under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and particularly emphasises measures that must be taken to combat the financing of terrorism. Member states are obliged to criminalise the possession or collection of funds for terrorist acts and freeze the funds, financial assets or economic resources of those who commit, participate in or facilitate terrorist acts and to report on actions taken to those ends within 90 days.</P>
    <P>We will do all in our power to ensure that the committee to be established to monitor the implementation of the resolution by all member states is operational as soon as possible. In this regard, I hope that it will be possible to reach an early agreement on the structure and chairmanship of the committee. I assure the House that Ireland played a full role in the intensive discussions on the drafting of this resolution, in particular in seeking to ensure that the necessary balance was struck between the need, on the one hand, to tackle terrorism more effectively, but not, on the other, at the expense of the observance of fundamental human rights. Our efforts received the commendation of several council members following the adoption of this resolution.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council has been demanding the closure of terrorist camps in areas controlled by the Taliban for the past three years. The Security Council has also been demanding that Osama bin Laden be handed over for trial. The council has been rebuffed in both these demands, despite the imposition of stringent sanctions by the international community against the Taliban regime. Those who committed these acts of terror and those who supported them can no longer be allowed to defy the will of the international community.</P>
    <P>The Government is extremely concerned about the plight of the Afghan people. There are already millions of Afghans living as refugees in neighbouring countries or as displaced persons in their own country. They are the victims of drought, civil war and, in some cases, the Taliban regime which controls 90% of the national territory. The current crisis is causing further population movements out of the major cities and towards the frontier.</P>
    <P>Over several years Ireland has consistently <Col N="126" /> sought to highlight the humanitarian situation of the Afghan people at the UN. In part due to our efforts, the Security Council has decided to keep the situation under constant review. Let there be no doubt as to those primarily responsible for the hardship imposed on the Afghan people. The UN Secretary General has firmly laid this responsibility on the Taliban regime.</P>
    <P>A £2.8 million grant aid package for Afghanistan was announced on Monday by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell. This package, the largest ever for a single emergency, will continue to support the work of Irish NGOs and the main international agencies in responding to the crisis in Afghanistan. Along with the £1.2 million already provided since January, this brings the total assistance provided by Ireland Aid for Afghanistan in 2001 to £4 million. The Government stands ready to consider further assistance in the light of developments. We do not see any alternative to a long-term and permanent political settlement in Afghanistan. We will ensure that this objective remains to the forefront of international concern and efforts during Ireland's presidency of the Security Council in October.</P>
    <P>There is concern about the impact and implications of a US military response. The US shares with all states the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence, recognised under Article 51 of the UN Charter. It has suffered a vicious attack, the latest and by the far the most deadly in a long series of attacks on US targets. It believes it may be the subject of further attacks planned and controlled by persons who are sheltered and sustained by the government or <i>de facto</i> authorities of another state. There can be little doubt that action by way of self-defence is justified under international law as long as the response is proportionate.</P>
    <P>In offering over flight and refuelling facilities to states whose forces are engaged in bringing to justice those who carried out or assisted in the dreadful attacks on the United States and are seeking to prevent further such attacks, Ireland is living up to its responsibilities under Resolution 1368, as now reinforced by Resolution 1373. It can be seen as a tangible expression of our solidarity with the American people in the face of the terrible unprovoked onslaught of 11 September. Our offer to a country and a people who have in difficult times in the past supported Ireland is both right and honourable.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed that this might mean that Ireland will soon be involved in a war. This is not so. We continue our policy of military neutrality. We have not joined any military alliance and we are not committing Irish troops to action. The Government is simply acting to assist a concerted international response to deal with appalling acts of international terrorism pursuant to UN resolutions. Most emphatically, Ireland is not neutral between freedom and terrorism. We have never been neutral in the face of international terrorism or in our unambiguous support of the United Nations. The offer of facili<Col N="127" /> ties was not raised in the special Dáil debate on 18 September for the simple reason that the Government, in a fluid and fast evolving situation, was still considering the options open to it at the time of the debate. It used the opportunity of the special European Council to formally announce its offer. No discourtesy was intended since no decision had been taken at that stage.</P>
    <P>If innocent lives are to be protected, it is necessary to stand against those with intent to carry out indiscriminate acts of terrorism. However, the Government expects any military response to be proportionate, measured and focused on the pursuit of justice. The Government will monitor the situation carefully and will continue to pursue a multi-faceted response to the current crisis. This will involve direct assistance in efforts to bring to justice those behind the attacks on the US, co-operation in efforts in the UN and EU frameworks to combat international terrorism and determined efforts to address the conflicts and injustices on which terrorism preys.</P>
    <P>We will support action in conformity with the UN Charter or in pursuit of Security Council Resolutions against those who planned, supported and carried out these attacks. The US Government has made clear that it is embarking on a long and difficult campaign which will be pursued on a wide front, using diplomatic, military, economic and police assets. It has recognised the need to build the support of a broad, international coalition to act in a targeted manner and to offer clear justification for any action.</P>
    <P>Since the dreadful attacks of 11 September, intensive efforts in various fora have been under way to improve the methods and responses available to the international community in combating terrorism. Ireland has been, and will continue to be, in the forefront of these efforts in the Security Council and with our partners in the European Union we will play our full and active part in this critical international effort.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outrageous terrorism visited on the United States last month illustrates how frail can be the security we take for granted. This is as true for Europe as it is for the United States. We live in a changed Europe which is no longer bitterly divided between two blocs. It is increasingly coming together in an enlarged European Union. This Union has security needs and Ireland has a role to play in meeting and shaping these needs. On this issue, sloganeering and playing on the fears of people has been a substitute for policy advocacy in Ireland for too long. Our neutrality to which the Minister has just referred may now leave us vulnerable to attack. Can we defend American interests in Ireland, which are also Irish interests, from terrorist attack? I doubt it, but we have an opportunity to participate in building an EU defence entity which would reduce our vulnerability. Europe is moving ahead on security <Col N="128" /> co-operation and Ireland will face crucial decisions about what its role should be. It is time to stop pretending these issues are not on the agenda. If we put the issues openly to the people and allow for reasoned debate instead of fear-mongering, we might bring about EU security and defence structures which serve Ireland's and the EU's best interests and more people might vote in EU referenda.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael favoured joining Partnership for Peace through the front door and not through any side door entrance while the public looked the other way. We set out our position in the 1996 foreign policy White Paper and we published policy documents on PfP in January 1998. We have also set out our policy on future EU security. The time has come for an open debate on Ireland's role in the evolving European security architecture. It is wrong to suggest that consensus exists on this issue. We have been given a warning by what happened in New York and it is time we took that warning seriously.</P>
    <P>Serious unrest in the Balkans has seen tens of thousands killed, injured, raped and ethnically cleansed. The view from the UN, where Ireland is a current member of the Security Council and has just taken the chair, is that Europe must take the lead role in resolving conflict on its Continent. What will be Ireland's role? Should it be to demand that someone somewhere do something about events, such as the mass murder in Srebrenica, as long as they are Dutch, German, American or British? What role does Ireland want to play in the Europe of the 21st century? Fine Gael believes Ireland should play a pro-active role, setting out our vision for the future rather than leaving it to others to set the agenda.</P>
    <P>The precedent of EMU, whereby the rules have been set by those willing to participate initially with all future members having to adhere to these rules, is a model likely to be repeated in relation to future security and defence arrangements. For this reason, it is in Ireland's interest to consider now what we want for Ireland and for Europe. It is time for us to become one of the architects in designing future European security and defence structures. Otherwise, we will be vulnerable. We have not served the best interests of the public by serving our own interests in this House and pretending there is a definition of neutrality to which we all subscribe.</P>
    <P>Our attention might concentrate on Article 5 of the Western European Union Treaty which states that if any of the high contracting parties should be the subject of an armed attack in Europe the other high contracting parties will, in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, afford the parties so attacked all the military and other aid and assistance in their power. The effect of this Article 5 commitment is that an attack on one Western European Union state must automatically be met with all the military and other aid and assistance in the power of every other Western European Union state. If such an article was incorporated <Col N="129" /> in a future EU treaty, every state which had signed up to the treaty would automatically lose its right to decide whether to become involved and would be bound by these provisions. It may be that not all EU members would sign up for treaty defence provisions from the start but just as in EMU, the rules will have been cast in stone and changing them later would be extremely difficult. If Article 5 could be incorporated as a protocol in a future EU treaty, it would mean that certain member states would, through the use of the protocol, come to the defence of another member state if attacked only by their own decision which had been explicitly taken, that is, not automatically. This would ensure that existing EU neutral states would have their positions safeguarded to the greatest extent possible, as would other EU states if they wished to exercise the protocol option.</P>
    <P>Our concern in Ireland should not be to shirk our responsibilities or to refuse to come to the aid of another EU partner state. Our wish should be that partner states would choose to come to our aid if we find ourselves in need of assistance. Who would have the capacity to intercept aircraft used as missiles to attack the International Financial Services Centre? We do not have such capacity. Our concern should be to ensure that if we assist a partner state, it will be by our own decision rather than as a result of automatic provision.</P>
    <P>A future EU common defence policy or common defence entity which could be constituted as a regional organisation under the UN Charter could be based on the following principles: adherence to the fundamental principles of the United Nations; a commitment to the vigorous pursuit of the goal of universal nuclear and biological disarmament and to a solemn undertaking by the European defence union acting as an entity not to use nuclear or biological weapons; a commitment to mutual defence and support among all EU states, based on Article 5 protocol arrangements for those states which do not want to make this an automatic provision; a commitment as a priority to the provision of resources to UN mandated peacekeeping and peacemaking operations and to the Petersberg Tasks of the Western European Union, that is, humanitarian aid, search and rescue, peacekeeping and peace enforcement, including tasks of combat forces on a case by case basis; and respect for the right of other member states, if they so wish, to be involved in other military alliances, such as NATO.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that by advocating a European defence entity now based on the principles I have outlined, and with an Article 5 type commitment as a protocol not a full treaty provision, we would win a measure of support across the Union which would ensure good prospects of implementation. Furthermore, we believe that by being up front at home and by putting the issues clearly before the people here with provision for twice annual debates on common foreign and security policy and related issues, we will serve <Col N="130" /> the best interests of the people. It is time to stop making security and defence policy by stealth because that is the way to guarantee that Irish neutrality will be ended on the least favourable terms for Ireland and on the rules written by others. Let us be open with the people and let us put the issues clearly before them. What happened in the United States could happen in Europe. European security is of direct concern to us as evidenced by the special European Council last month. We should stop behaving as if it is not.</P>
    <P>We are all deeply saddened by what happened in the United States. I cannot add any words to the condemnation and concerns already expressed by other Members of the House. We must stop fooling ourselves and the people. The security of this State is of concern to this House. We must learn from what happened in America because we are vulnerable. We need security arrangements and we should not apologise to anyone for making the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record that I share fully in the expressions of outrage at what was done on 11 September and the expressions of sympathy, solidarity and support to Americans and the many other people who suffered in many ways on that day.</P>
      <P>The four hijackings that led to that slaughter were planned with great care and deliberation and with the full knowledge of what they could do over a long period. They were carried out by people who were clearly determined that they were going to succeed in the enterprise in which they set out. One group appears to have been partly frustrated only because a few brave individuals took responsibility on themselves. It is chilling to read what has emerged so far about the nature of the relationship between the people who were involved in carrying out these acts. Our response to those acts must be framed in the light of the nature of the attack and the attackers. It would take more time than I have at my disposal to develop that point fully.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs identified three levels of response: bringing the perpetrators to justice, defeating the monster of international terrorism, and putting an end to conflicts and injustices that breed this kind of terrorism. However, that is a great deal more than any action or set of actions that can be put in place in a year. It is dangerously unwise to use language such as &ldquo;defeating the monster of terrorism&rdquo;. No single action or series of actions will put an end to terrorism. I do not want to be a pessimist but we must be reconciled to the fact that we will need careful and active counter-measures in place for quite a long time to come.</P>
      <P>The response of the civilised world, of all religions and of none, to these acts cannot be a response in kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the civilised world responds in kind, the terrorists will have won by bringing us down to their level. Our response must be measured, judged, proportionate and targeted. While it is a hard thing to say, the first part of that response must be to use persuasion, in so far as possible. In the present case, that does not mean that the civilised world has to send a constant stream of emissaries to Kabul or Kandahar to seek the handing over of Mr. bin Laden, or anyone else against whom there is evidence. That procedure cannot go on forever, but it must be undertaken.</P>
      <P>Any further measures that are taken must be targeted, proportionate and above all must seek to avoid inflicting the kind of suffering that was inflicted on people in New York on 11 September. While that response needs a great deal more parsing and analysis, we must accept that combating terrorism is not the work of one year or five; it will take far longer. The fight against terrorism has so many facets that we could spend a long time discussing ways of accomplishing it.</P>
      <P>One essential element has to involve structures through which perpetrators can be brought to justice. Although we agreed not so long ago, by referendum, to set up an institution that has the jurisdiction to do that, I regret we have not yet legislated for it. I also regret that the country which has suffered most cruelly from these latest incidents of terrorism, refuses to participate in setting up that jurisdiction. The cruel irony is that the country currently most under attack is not lending the necessary support to putting in place the jurisdiction to deal with the perpetrators of such attacks in a proper, civilised, democratic and humane manner. We must not ever lose our civilisation and humanity or our adherence to the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Although events may have moved on, it is essential that everything done in response to these attacks, and to any such future attacks, must be done firmly under the aegis of the United Nations. The European Union should be better organised to co-operate in that matter but I will not discuss that point now. I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs every success in his period of chairing the Security Council because there will be an enormous burden upon him. He will endeavour to bear that burden and his intention will be to steer a course through these turbulent times that will be productive and will maintain the values of civilisation which the UN was set up to preserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already know that the instruments at our disposal in the United Nations are, in many ways, sadly deficient. It is an irony that only an few months after the people of this country refused to ratify a European Union treaty that might have helped the EU to move along this path, we may find ourselves in a position where key actions that perhaps should be taken by the United Nations, could well be frustrated by the operation of a veto of one of the permanent members of the Security Council. I hope that does not happen <Col N="132" /> because the United Nations is our only bastion against both terrorism and inhumane over-reaction to the threat that terrorism poses.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that the House should meet to discuss what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has described as this defining moment in history. I join all my colleagues in the House in renewing our condemnation of the barbarous acts committed in the United States of America and also in setting out our determination to fight against terrorism of all kinds, both international and at home.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said on 18 September, it is important that Members of this House have the opportunity, on behalf of the nation we represent, to express our sorrow and outrage at the terrible and evil events that have occurred in the United States. The passage of time since those terrible events has only deepened the horror which we all feel about them. We have seen and read of the devastating effect which the terrorist acts had in the United States. We have seen and heard the traumatic effect this devastation has had on the families and friends of those who lost their loved ones.</P>
      <P>Like most people here, I have not seen the scene of the devastation but I have heard the Minister speak of the appalling sight of the wreckage of the World Trade Center in which are entombed the remains of more than 5,000 people. As the Minister told the UN General Assembly yesterday, it is out of this wreckage and this appalling destruction of human life that we, the people of the United Nations, must seek to rebuild the moral authority of the UN.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland have an important role to play in this regard. Ireland is not part of any military alliance, but we cannot be neutral in the fight against international terrorism. Ireland, as a member of the UN Security Council, fully supported Resolutions 1368 and 1373 which classify the terrorists attacks of 11 September 2001 as a threat to international peace and security. These resolutions gave the United States a mandate to defend itself in a targeted and proportionate manner by bringing to justice those who planned, perpetrated and assisted in these outrages, and who continue to threaten international peace and security.</P>
      <P>Resolution 1368 called on all states to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of those terrorists attacks, and called on the international community to redouble its efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will play its part in responding to the immediate terrorist threat by co-operating in police investigations and opening air space and air<Col N="133" /> ports to aircraft operating in pursuit of Resolution 1368. We would be in dereliction of our international duties if we failed to support the UN mandate in this way.</P>
    <P>A further example of Ireland's commitment to the fight against international terrorism is our support for the UN convention on the suppression of the financing of terrorism. This convention requires countries to make it an offence in their national law for any person directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, to provide or collect funds with the intention or in the knowledge that they are to be used to carry out terrorist acts. Terrorism cannot survive without financial support and this international resolution aims to cut off that support. Ireland fully supports this approach. We all must do our utmost to cut off financial support for international terrorism wherever it may exist.</P>
    <P>The UN must play a key role in responding to this terrorist attack. We would all urge the United States to take advantage of the possibilities offered by an international organisation such as the UN for the suppression of international terrorism and international crime. I join all Members in expressing our support for the Minister, Deputy Cowen and his officials over the next month as Ireland assumes the Presidency of the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay my respects to the victims of this appalling atrocity and to their families and friends throughout the world. While we have seen the pictures of shattered buildings, we can only imagine the devastation in the hearts of the families and friends of those killed and injured in these appalling atrocities.</P>
    <P>The Government is also concerned that there should be no more innocent victims of this struggle against terrorism. The Afghan people, who are already suffering terribly from the effects of drought, civil war and political instability, are not to blame for the action of international terrorists and must not suffer the consequences. Millions of Afghans are already living as refugees in neighbouring countries or as displaced persons in their own country.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently sought to highlight the humanitarian situation of the Afghan people at the UN Security Council and recently announced an additional £2.8 million aid package for Afghanistan. This package, the biggest ever for a single emergency, will continue to support the work of Irish NGOs such as Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and Christian Aid and the main international agencies in responding to the crisis in Afghanistan. With £1.2 million already provided since January, this further announcement brings the total assistance provided by Ireland Aid for Afghanistan in 2001 to £4 million.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the implications of the situation in the USA for events throughout the world and, in particular, in our own country. One might have hoped that the tragedy in the USA would have helped to bring together conflicting parties in other countries to resolve their difficulties in a <Col N="134" /> peaceful, non-violent manner. Unfortunately this does not seem to be occurring in some cases and, for example, today's news from Israel and Palestine is not encouraging.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland we are facing a breakdown in the political structures which threatens to undermine the achievements which have been made over the past few years. The danger in the North has always been that a breakdown in the political process would lead to a return to escalating violence. In recent months we have seen what can happen in the absence of political leadership with the appalling threats to young children in Belfast and the recent tragic murder of Martin O'Hagan. However, because of an abject failure in political leadership by politicians on both sides, the political structures in Northern Ireland may collapse in the coming weeks. All of us on these islands need to consider this issue very carefully in light of the tragic events in the United States of America and ask ourselves if this is the direction in which we wish to go.</P>
    <P>The attacks in the USA have been a defining and historic moment for us all. We must all work together to ensure that terrorism is suppressed both nationally and internationally and to ensure that these events cannot happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this topic at today's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I do not wish to repeat my remarks, but rather to expand some aspects of what I had to say.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Government and this House should be seen to take whatever legislative steps are necessary to support the strong feeling throughout the world towards the suppression of terrorism and attempts to control it by financial and other means. At the meeting I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs which conventions concerning the suppression or combating of terrorism have not been ratified or put into force by Ireland. The Minister told me that the information would be included in his written reply to a parliamentary question today and he was good enough to send the reply to me. However, the contents are disturbing as Ireland has not ratified and is not a party to more than half of the 12 conventions regarding this topic. I am amazed at this. I have just come from a Whips meeting which discussed the most mundane business for next week and the following week. I would have thought this is the kind of legislation which is necessary.</P>
      <P>We have a difficulty in that we often cannot ratify these conventions unless we pass legislation. It is often the case that, for technical reasons, we cannot ratify these conventions by simply passing a motion of the Dáil. If they are to be incorporated into Irish law it can, apparently, only be done by way of a full Bill the preparation of which seems to take an inordinate amount of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is not a party to the following conventions: the Convention on the Prevention and Pun<Col N="135" /> ishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Personnel &ndash; New York, December 1973; the Convention against the Taking of Hostages &ndash; New York, December 1979; the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation &ndash; Rome, March 1988; the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms on the Continental Shelf &ndash; Rome, March 1988; the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection &ndash; Montreal, March 1991; the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings &ndash; New York, December 1997 and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism &ndash; New York, December 1999.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that all of these conventions cried out for ratification by Ireland and it makes us look somewhat foolish in the climate post 11 September that we have not done so. Even if the events of 11 September had not happened, this country and island have been subject to terrorism for a long time. We now know that this terrorism of the home-grown variety has major international connections and connotations. Sinn Féin/IRA is in open consort with the FARC guerrillas in Colombia and with ETA terrorists in Spain. From its point of view it has had the good fortune in that for a long time its chief quartermaster and the supplier of most of its arms and all its Semtex was Colonel Gadaffi of Libya. It was not averse to having suitable international connections with other terrorists or those who would supply terrorists. However, for some time it has apparently been the official policy here to indulge these people rather than to ask them to do what is right.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated that the peace process in Northern Ireland was in grave danger of breaking down because of a lack of political leadership on all, or both, sides. I do not think that is true. If it breaks down, it will do so for one simple reason and that is that Sinn Féin-IRA will not decommission its weapons and explosives. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that it might break down for any other reason because that is what is at the root of it. The Irish and British Governments have bent over backwards in the past three years to implement every line of the Good Friday Agreement not just in the letter, but in the spirit in a way that could not have been envisaged when it was drafted and signed. It has been implemented on all sides except by the IRA. We should not gloss over that fact. We are entitled to ask why it retains a private army if it is a democratic party, as it claims to be. Not alone has it a private army, but we learn that in Kerry, at least, it has a private police force also. We are asked to look the other way because the culture of the moment is to gloss over this and to indulge these people continuously while they run rings around the Good Fri<Col N="136" /> day Agreement, acting in defiance of the overwhelming view of the Irish people, North and South. I ask the Government urgently to bring in whatever proposals are necessary, either by way of motion or legislation, to ratify the seven conventions to which we are not party. At a time like this, not to do so would show that we are only paying lip service to those who died in America, and to the United States in telling them that we will support them in their efforts to bring the perpetrators, and those behind them, to justice.</P>
    <P>I remind this House that on this island there are people, who describe themselves as democrats, but who, on an almost nightly basis, engage in the mutilation and torture of people with whom they disagree. There is an organisation, headed by Sinn Féin, which decides whether an Irish citizen is entitled to live on this island or be banished from it. There are several dozen people, particularly young men, who are banished for what is described as anti-social activities, which are frequently simply because they got into an argument with a member of Sinn Féin in a pub or some such place. The sooner that we face up to the degree of racketeering which leads to vast sums of money being raised and spent by Sinn Féin in ostensibly a democratic cause, the better. We should call a spade a spade for a change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say something on our current position on the events of Tuesday, 11 September. Over the weekend, the Labour Party conference passed a comprehensive motion dealing with those events which condemned unequivocally the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, expressed its admiration for the heroism of the emergency services and also called for a multi-lateral response to them. It continued in detail to justify that position. I will say a few words on why we hold these views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some of the speeches earlier, I was glad to note a change in emphasis. It is accepting that language is very important. For example, in the Minister's speech the word &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; occurs. There is an enormous difference between a war on terrorism and a campaign against terrorism internationally. A campaign against terrorism internationally can include such measures as closing off the financial sources for international terrorism, the sharing of information, the prevention of terrorism and, in addition, can speak about how people who differ in terms of culture, religious beliefs, or in how they believe their economies should be organised, can live with each other. A campaign to eliminate terrorism is important. It is very different from a war. A war, of its nature, in terms of international law in terms of the international institutions, presumes that the enemy can easily be identified, that military forces and resources can be amassed easily, that the target can be defined and that one can estimate if one is achieving a victory or suffering a defeat. It is also very important in relation to the status of international law itself and the inter<Col N="137" /> national instruments. Thus, it has been generally assumed that nations can identify an enemy and declare war on another nation. It is also, in a separate development in international law, and endemic in the forces that led to the founding of the United Nations, that the right to self defence exists. It is there before sovereignty was exchanged with other sovereignties at the time of the founding of the United Nations. It precedes the United Nations. It is established within the UN Charter, but what is important is that the force and authority of the institution is built on multi-lateralism. It is, therefore, not academic at all. One speaks about a multi-lateral approach towards combating terrorism, which is able to deal with the length of time that is required and the diversity of sources in which terrorism resides.</P>
    <P>It is also important to state, as a spokesperson on foreign affairs of a party of the Left, that the Left has always condemned terrorism because historically it has led to a reaction which has justified counter-reaction leading to further repression which in turn leads to further restrictions. It is frequently the hope of terrorists to force such a response to enable them to escalate their attack on civil society itself. It is, therefore, important that the character of the response to an act of terrorism is one that does not deliver any bonuses to terrorism itself, any partial victories. This is extremely easy to say but difficult to achieve. It is, nevertheless, necessary to say it. It is very important to put not just the events but also the reaction to them in a proper context.</P>
    <P>Having said that, one must take account of the emotion, the grief and the horror that was visited not just on 6,000 people but on all of their families, relatives and those who were defiled by having to look at the circumstances in which people were forced to try and save their lives from buildings that were attacked by civilian aircraft turned into a missile of destruction. That must be taken into account. I was moved by the relatives of those who lost people in the Twin Towers of New York. One woman from Galway, whose brother was lost, said that the last thing she wanted was an act of retribution because it would do nothing for her grief. When one has said that, it is very important to try and see how our actions are best construed.</P>
    <P>One of the things that is important as we take the chair of the United Nations Security Council is that we use our efforts there to try to restore the United Nations' authority. Some incredible things were said since the horrific events of Tuesday, 11 September, such as that people should lash out quickly. Others have said the United Nations is useless, while others point to the horrific events in Srebrenica. The problem about all that is the United Nations is the only multi-national institution we have. We had the League of Nations after the first world war and the United Nations after the second world war. About ten years ago we chaired the Security Council of the United Nations. The United Nations is the institution we need and it has been <Col N="138" /> weakened by those who have not supported it financially and by those who have put obstacles in its place. When one looks at the balance of the United Nations itself with its 189 members in the General Assembly and its Permanent Members, an unreformed Security Council with five Permanent Members in the Security Council, has frequently weakened the will to reform that has existed among the General Assembly itself.</P>
    <P>I hope we will use our time on the Security Council to make the case for reform of the United Nations so that this veto will be eventually eliminated. Even the concept of a Permanent Member should be eliminated. If one takes the contradiction that is at the heart of the weak United Nations seriously, it is that the countries that have joined, have joined it in terms of an act of sovereignty but at the same time they are contributing to something that is to be the potential for some kind of multi-lateral security. At the same time then, the Permanent Members of the Security Council have an inordinate influence. The Security Council itself under Article 24 administers the work of the United Nations on behalf of all of the members.</P>
    <P>There is need for a reform and to ensure the lead role of the United Nations as a multi-lateral institution in dictating the responses and also organising a campaign against terrorism internationally. There is also a need to restore the authority of the international community in other areas that are sources of conflict. I mean very specifically, in relation to the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which originally were development institutions formed after the Second World War and which were envisaged as reporting to the economic committee and in turn to the Security Council of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>There is a need to build the authority of the United Nations. I criticise the decision of the Taoiseach to ignore this House of the Oireachtas and to instruct the Minister for Foreign Affairs to offer the use of our airports. We did so without anything being specified in relation to what actions were being supported. Were they of a multi-lateral kind or of a unilateral kind? Were they ones that had guarantees in relation to the lives of civilians? Were they proportionate? Where was the guarantee of that? One could list the questions to be posed. These questions are not academic. I stress that in relation to the fall-out from all of that very interesting discussion, the issue is a very much bigger one than the issue of ignoring the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Here an infamous role is regularly played by the media. I suggest that the media take the time to read the Charter of the UN. The UN was formed to build peace in a world that had been wrecked by war. They should also realise the significance of putting as a sub-title &ldquo;America at war&rdquo;, &ldquo;War against terrorism&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>War is what is in Article 28.3 of the Constitution. If one was to uncritically join up in that response, one would place oneself in the position <Col N="139" /> of having made a frail Article 28.3 and its requirements of accountability to this House. A campaign is what is required. There are considerable risks in unilateralism. There are people who are being coy about these issues. Nothing could justify and nothing does justify or ever will justify the actions that took place.</P>
    <P>Equally, respect for human life is indivisible and there are parts of the world to which we did not turn our attention sufficiently and where a weak multi-national institution like the UN has been blocked. That the state of Israel has ignored the regular resolutions of the United Nations has been disastrous. Equally, if one is speaking about the Middle East being restored to peace, it means that both sides must have a respect for UN initiatives. That has been made difficult. I remember visiting Gaza in the early 1980s and seeing young children playing at the edge of a sewer with their grandmother looking on &ndash; three generations since 1947 in conditions that were unliveable. These neglected sources of conflict in the world are in Gaza and also in Africa.</P>
    <P>Our uncritical participation in a world economic order that condemns 1.4 billion people to living on less than 70 cents a day; this kind of world in which one can ignore conflicts in particular places, accept trade talks such as the Uruguay Round where a continent like Africa loses $3 billion worth of trade, where six months ago, the price of coffee was $1.26 a kilo and is today less than 80 cents, a world where people are condemned to poverty &ndash; these are the seed beds from which terrorism comes.</P>
    <P>Bin Laden is a terrorist who was originally funded by a power that sought his assistance in releasing the people of Afghanistan from Soviet occupation. I say to the Minister, bin Laden's allies at different stages included the people in the Northern Alliance. What would our position be now if we were asked to support an initiative that favoured putting the Northern Alliance in the place of the Taliban? It would be a nonsense to suggest that suddenly the Northern Alliance has become respectable when it is clear that there is no evidence for this.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental in relation to civilian life. We have accepted it in Iraq. I have rejected it and others have rejected it, that the children of Iraq are regarded as hostages for the actions of Saddam Hussein. I recall the ambivalence too when in this House I condemned Saddam Hussein way before the Iraqi war, for his action against the Kurds. I did not get that much support because he was by then being supplied with mustard gas by France and Germany. We must realise that if we are to say we are to take up a strong position in responding to actions, we must be sincere. The militarists want to use the word &ldquo;war&rdquo; for everything and I say to them that a world which in 1995 had $864 billion spent on weapons of destruction and in the same year $15 billion was spent on the four main preventable diseases, is a world that is indefensible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> I am not saying any of this to justify the loss of life of anyone in New York, Pennsylvania or Washington. We must think it through and that is why multi-national responses are important. In Afghanistan, where bin Laden hides out, it is 170 in the list of 174 countries in the United Nations human development report; it has a minimum of 750,000 adults and children who have lost limbs. When I saw that figure &ndash; 10% of the land mines of the world &ndash; it reminded me of Cambodia.</P>
    <P>We are faced with choices. Do we have a patient response that stresses multi-lateralism, that stresses the role of reform of the UN, that speaks of these issues that are happening in the world in less militaristic language? We must also realise that if we are to defend life and defend civilian life, we must do so in an undivided way across the planet. To put it in context, from 1945 &ndash; just before the UN was formed &ndash; to 1993, 150 million people have died from preventable diseases, many of them children. From 1945 to 1993, 23 million people have been lost through military action. There has been a decline in terms of the £15 billion spent on the four preventable diseases. We are invited to increase the £864 billion being spent on weapons of destruction. The reality, as the founder of UNESCO put it, is that &ldquo;War begins in the minds of men.&rdquo;  That was his phrase in the generic sense of including women. Peace also begins in the minds of people.</P>
    <P>We must be careful in our language and what we are doing. There is nothing macho, realistic or better about talking about going to war. There is nothing lesser, weaker or no sense of people wringing their hands on the sidelines about talking of a new response. It is a secure world that addresses these structural problems that will create the atmosphere in which we will make the actions of the terrorists impossible.</P>
    <P>Many important points have been made. We have said for so long that we could not interfere with international capital movements, thus, we could not openly ask about international armaments and their movements through Switzerland and elsewhere. Now we have been forced to do so because the terrorists are using the conduits at which we could not look. We could have done this in regard to the international drugs trade and the armaments trade. I hope our response to this matter will lead us to encourage the United States to embrace multi-lateralism and that this will encourage others to link the issues of aid, trade and debt towards a more secure world that will make terrorism impossible.</P>

      <P>The House is united in condemning unequivocally the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States. Those who carried out these atrocities must be brought to <Col N="141" /> justice. There are clear differences on how this is to be achieved. A quick fix military solution is not the answer. Already we see in Afghanistan a looming humanitarian crisis. This is because of the threat of war and the influx of refugees into Pakistan. If a direct attack were to take place in Kabul or elsewhere, we would see a worsening of that humanitarian crisis and a spiral of violence. Many young people would join the fundamentalists and become the type of terrorist we all despise. We need to be aware of this.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that we are a party to that sort of violence. The House should give its assent to the use of Irish airports. Deputy Sargent who tried to raise this issue today should not have been thrown out of the House for trying to assert his democratic rights. There has been no vote and there will not be one at the end of these statements tonight. I ask the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to cast his mind back to the Gulf War. I have a copy of <i>The Irish Times </i> of 17 January 1991 and at that time there was great concern about the use of Irish airports. The House was recalled and there was a vote. The Labour Party and The Workers' Party insisted there should be a vote as otherwise such a measure would be seen to be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The Constitution is clear on this matter. Article 28.3.1 states that war shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann. Article 29.1 states that Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality. We should respect the Constitution. We should respect the Members of this House. I am not saying that those of us who are opposed to the use of Irish airports would win such a vote, but for our voices to be heard properly, for people to realise there are Members who are opposed to this and for the Constitution be fully respected, we should have a vote on this matter. I believe that this matter will be challenged in the courts and, if so, it will be interesting to see how they will interpret it. This situation needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins said that words are important. I believe that too. I ask the Minister to be careful in his use of words. He used the phrase &ldquo;we cannot be neutral against terrorism.&rdquo;  Implicit in that is the suggestion that those of us who want to uphold Irish neutrality are somehow soft on terrorism. That is not the case. I ask him to be careful in that regard as there are many, including some members of his party, who do not want Irish airports to be used in this way. Such people are not soft on terrorism. This is a breach of neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also be careful about what we say about the United Nations. The Minister has quoted over and over again Resolution 1368 of 12 September 2001. This is a resolution, not a UN mandate. The resolution is clear. It states, &ldquo;. take all necessary steps to respond to terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 and to combat all <Col N="142" /> forms of terrorism [these are the key words] in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.&rdquo;  Article 51 has been quoted again and again. The key words in that article are, &ldquo;until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.&rdquo;  The Security Council can do that under Chapter 7 and give a mandate for armed force under Article 42, but has not done so. We need to be clear that in terms of international law we are not behaving properly.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister's experience of terrorism in his own country, he can play a constructive role now that he has taken the chair of the UN Security Council. That experience must be brought to bear. When I hear George Bush talking now about a Palestinian state, that is encouraging. Those noises need to be made and that signal needs to be sent out. This crisis can only be solved, as Deputy Michael Higgins said, multilaterally by dealing with the core issues on a diplomatic front and with the benefit of better intelligence.</P>
    <P>We have seen how it was very difficult to defeat terrorism in our own country by military means alone. In terms of the Real IRA, some progress has been made in infiltrating that organisation. I was surprised when I heard that the United States does not have the wherewithal to send people to Afghanistan who can speak the language. That is a deficit. There is a call for an instant reaction, but that will not work. The Minister, in his role on the Security Council, can play an important role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thousands of innocent people died for political purposes in the terrorist incidents in the United States on 11 September. Everyone in the House unreservedly condemns those incidents and the perpetrators of those atrocities must be brought to justice. Achieving justice is key to ensuring the prevention of such outrages in the future.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on the question of the need for an international criminal court. The Serb leader, Slobodan Milosevic, is currently before the international court for war crimes. An inquiry is also proceeding into the Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry. The perpetrators of that atrocity, including the political figures who gave orders, must end up before an international criminal court and the same applies to the perpetrators of the atrocities in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attacks on 11 September were crimes against humanity and demonstrate the need and rationale for an international criminal court. Since 1998, 139 states have signed the treaty that would establish that court. Convincing the rest of the states to become party to that treaty must be a priority for Ireland and the United States, particularly for Ireland since it is chairing the Security Council for the month of October. Ireland must ratify the statute of the International Criminal Court and seek its ratification by other countries, including the United States. <Col N="143" /> However, an international system of justice must be seen to be fair if it is to be effective in defeating terrorism. Israeli leaders who killed 17,000 civilians in the terrible bombing of Beirut and organised the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian families in the Sabra and Shatila camps by militia must also face the international courts. States as well as individuals must be answerable. Selective justice will breed new terrorists.</P>
    <P>The recent renunciation by the Bush regime of the Kyoto treaty on global warming and the treaty restricting ballistic missiles is worrying. The attitude of the United States and Israel to the recent conference on racism, chaired by Ms Mary Robinson, is also a cause for concern. There is a suspicion that the US military industrial complex is deliberately creating the political conditions for major expansions of arms production and using the outrage against innocent civilians to silence all objections.</P>
    <P>The launch of a war on the impoverished and hungry Afghan people involving considerable loss of civilian life is surely not the answer to terrorism. The institution of an international system of justice to which individuals and states will be accountable is the key to eradicating terrorism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on record an emergency statement adopted by the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis last Saturday. The Ard-Fheis condemned the horrific attacks on the USA on 11 September and sent deepest sympathy to President Bush and the people of America and joined with them in solidarity at this time of sadness at the terrible tragedy and loss of life in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. It stated that we who have looked to America for support and help now stand with all those who have suffered. In particular, it paid tribute to Irish America for their support and huge generosity to us in our search for peace and justice in Ireland and noted with particular sadness the deaths of those from that community.</P>
      <P>Those responsible for the attacks on the USA should be brought to justice before an international court established by and responsible to the United Nations. There is growing opposition in Ireland and worldwide to a retaliatory war. We are being offered a choice between total support for the as yet undefined war on terror by NATO and its allies or support for those who carried out the atrocities in the USA. This is a false choice. We should not give unquestioning support to whatever military action may be taken by NATO. The offer of facilities at Irish airports to NATO forces represents a clear violation of our military neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that we should not be neutral in opposition to those who carry out such atrocities, but that should not translate into support for military alliances which are at this moment preparing for war. Like other Deputies, I question the constitutionality of the Government's decision to give NATO aircraft access to Irish airports when <Col N="144" /> Article 28 of the Constitution states that the State shall not participate in a war save with the assent of the Dáil. I urge the Government to reconsider and reverse this unwise and, possibly, unconstitutional decision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government announcement of aid for Irish organisations in the USA, working with survivors and the bereaved, and for Afghan refugees. I acknowledge the work of the Irish Consultate General in New York in assisting the injured, the bereaved, those whose relatives are missing and those in Ireland seeking information and help.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the scurrilous attacks on Sinn Féin which, disgracefully, have been made by some political opponents in the wake of the atrocities in the USA. I will not dignify with a detailed response those who would use such a tragedy in a petty, party political effort to stem the electoral growth of Sinn Féin. The Irish people see these anti-republican attacks for what they are, cynical and opportunist. We will not be diverted by such tactics, be they from Deputy O'Malley or anybody else.</P>
    <P>The most important thing we, in Ireland, must do in the aftermath of this tragedy is redouble our efforts to make our peace process work. There will be other occasions to discuss the current grave difficulties in the process, but it is the responsibility of both Governments and all parties to make progress possible.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Socialist Party and our international movement, the Committee for a Workers International, have trenchantly condemned the atrocity carried out in the United States on 11 September. The condemnation of international terror by the United States Government, the British and some other Governments, however, and their declaration of war on terror reek of nauseating hypocrisy. They have no moral authority to condemn terror because they have routinely deployed state terror themselves or sponsored state terror by others in pursuit of economic and political objectives that facilitate primarily the powerful multinational corporations which operate from these western countries, international capitalism as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive United States Administrations have for generations propped up, financed and facilitated murderous dictatorships in Central and South America and other regions which pillaged the wealth of their societies and imprisoned, tortured and slaughtered countless thousands of innocent citizens. In Chile the CIA organised the overthrow in 1973 of a democratically elected government. Mr. George Bush says he is pursuing a war against those who have murdered thousands of innocent people, people whom his Christian church would call the innocent children of God. However, what of the innocent children of Iraq? Are they the children of a lesser God? They must be in the eyes of Mr. Bush because his Government continues to visit painful death on thousands of them by the sanctions that deprive <Col N="145" /> them of medicine, nutrition, clean water and sanitation. That is terror of the most atrocious kind.</P>
    <P>The United States and British Governments are leading the hunt for Osama bin Laden and his organisation, al Qa'eda. They brought that organisation into being. Now that it has turned on them, their grotesquely deformed creature is to be destroyed. Mr. Blair is leading the charge. Mr. Blair is a sanctimonious hypocrite. Two years ago he had a notorious international terrorist, a proven mass murderer, in his custody &ndash; Mr. Augusto Pinochet of Chile. Did Mr. Blair then lead a crusade to have this mass killer brought to justice? In fact, Mr. Blair's Government did everything possible to get Pinochet safely out of Britain and back to Chile. Why? It was because Pinochet deployed his CIA sponsored terror in defence of the interests of the American and British multinationals and of the Government of the United States.</P>
    <P>Those who carried out the atrocity on 11 September most likely emanated from the poisoned situation in the Middle East. Does anybody believe that a war in Afghanistan will resolve that situation? It will simply make it worse. It was reckless and irresponsible of the Irish Government to offer Irish air space and airports for what the United States might do. This offer must be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Terrorism does not in any way advance the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Its effects are reactionary. One consequence of 11 September is a discussion of plans by governments, including EU governments, that will have the effect of attacking civil rights and the right to protest. In particular, the massive and peaceful movement against global capitalism may be under threat. That will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Empowering people through mass movement to change the world is how the tyranny brought about by global capitalism and the poverty and horror it entails can be challenged and overthrown. The principles of democratic socialism, where the fruits of the earth are equally deployed among the peoples and national oppression is removed for all time, are how we will create a world where both the state terrorism of the United States and Britain and the horrific terror of 11 September will be eliminated for all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Members in offering my sympathy to the people who were bereaved by the dreadful act of terrorism on 11 September. We listened to some Members speak tonight about state terrorism. The people who left their homes and families on that morning were not state terrorists. They were people who believed in democracy and were part of a democratic state. No person who has an ounce of humanity could justify this act of mass murder by international terrorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This action appears to have been planned on an international scale. The approach taken by the United States since the attack has been commended throughout the world. A powerful state with enormous military power has shown <Col N="146" /> immense self-restraint and inspired all other democratic states to come together in an alliance against international terrorism. The League of Nations and the United Nations have been mentioned. Perhaps it is now time for all countries to come together and form a new alliance against international terrorism. The willingness of terrorists to commit suicide in order to slaughter fellow human beings is a new departure. All countries which believe in human values, the sacredness of human life and the democratic process should come together to wipe out the evil organisations which are now flourishing.</P>
    <P>Irish born people have lost their lives in the attacks in the United States. I sympathise with my colleague, Deputy Gerry Reynolds, who lost two cousins and with all the other Irish families which have lost loved ones. The victims of this mass murder came from 60 different countries. We could never have imagined that such an awful thing could happen and we feel that the world will never be the same again. We can no longer travel in a relaxed manner and an air of suspicion now prevails throughout the western world.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs well in his role in the United Nations. Our role in that organisation is an honour for Ireland, but we take up our responsibilities at a critical stage in the history of international affairs.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with all those who lost loved ones and compliment the security forces, police and fire service on their wonderful work. We must not forget the work of the police and emergency services which faced acts of terrorism on our own island during the past 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this issue with a different perspective from many of my colleagues. I was unfortunate to be in Manhattan on 11 September when this terrible atrocity took place. It is very difficult to describe what happened to people who were not in the area. I was on my way to meet two of my first cousins who worked in the World Trade Centre and was 15 or 20 blocks away at 11 o'clock when the buildings collapsed. I will never forget the fear I experienced and the mayhem I saw. People covered in dust, with terror in their eyes, ran, although they did not know what they were running from. I ran for my life that day. I felt the terror of not knowing what was going to happen or whether I had experienced an earthquake or a terrorist attack. Some hours later, when I discovered what had happened and thought things through, I knew the chances of my cousins surviving were very slim.</P>
      <P>I know the Dáil was recalled while I was in New York and thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his kind words of sympathy to my family. They were greatly appreciated. The national day of mourning in Ireland was also appreciated by people in New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs well in his position as president of the United Nations Security Council. I hope he will have the wisdom to organise a multinational response against the <Col N="147" /> terrorists who organised this heinous crime and use his influence to ensure the innocent people of Afghanistan do not become pawns in the war against international terrorism. It will be difficult to find the perpetrators of this crime and impose retribution on people who are not known. I hope the actions taken by the United Nations Security Council and the Government of the United States will be carried out with an emphasis on bringing the terrorists who caused this crime to justice.</P>
    <P>While I was in New York for a second time for the service for one of my cousins the Minister for Foreign Affairs visited the site of the World Trade Center. I went there last Saturday and know the Minister was visibly affected by his visit. It is difficult to explain to people who have not been there just how bad the situation is. If this is war, then it is a dreadful thing and every action should be taken to prevent anything like this happening again in our lifetime. To bring into perspective the way in which this has affected the Irish community, 2,000 of more than 7,000 people presumed dead are Irish-Americans. Approximately 15,000 children in the New York tri-state area have lost a parent. More than 70% of those missing, presumed dead, are aged between 22 and 40. They represent the brains of the higher echelons of finance, law and other professions. It is difficult to attend services where there are no bodies to bury and where families are attempting to come to terms with the facts. I was struck by the ages of those attending the services for lost friends or colleagues, as they were young, professional people. A tragedy like this, visited on this our country, would be inexplicable and difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>My two cousins who died left two widows. One of them had two children, one aged three years and the other just 18 months old. His wife is seven months pregnant. My other cousin had three daughters, aged 11, nine and seven. Kieran Gorman, originally from Sligo and a neighbour of my colleague Deputy Matt Brennan, left two children and his wife is pregnant. It is mind-boggling and difficult to get one's head around the fact that there are more than 6,000 similar stories. It has had a dramatic effect on me. I gave interviews to radio and television stations and to the press when I was in New York to try to explain the feeling on the ground to people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The people of the United States are looking for security. They do not want their Government or armed forces to go to Afghanistan to kill innocent and defenceless people. They want to know their Government will pursue the terrorist cells that are sleeping in the United States. If US forces go into Middle Eastern countries like Afghanistan, will there be further terrorist attacks on the United States? American people are afraid and they want their country to be secure. I hope the wisdom and patience shown by the Government of the United States so far will continue.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to show my appreciation of the work being done by members of the Irish <Col N="148" /> Consulate in New York and by the staff of Aer Lingus. The courtesy, compassion, understanding and efficiency displayed to Irish families in a similar position to my own by the staff of the consulate and Aer Lingus was a joy to behold. It is wonderful that such professional people are working for our country abroad.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues I will address. There can no longer be grey areas as regards terrorism in this country. Sinn Féin must ask the IRA to decommission its weapons. There can be no more appeasement of terrorism, whether it is perpetrated by loyalists or republicans. This needs to be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of cynicism about politics in this country. The crimes in the United States bring into focus that politics is a noble profession. We need young, articulate, bright people in this House and in the political process. I hope the cynicism that has been expressed in recent years will be shaken by this terrible atrocity. Strong decisiveness, justice, wisdom and leadership are needed in the political life of the Western world. I hope the number of fatalities will motivate young people to become involved in politics in all Western democracies. It is important that the cynicism that exists is stopped.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about nuclear emergency planning. This House and this debate represent the correct forum to do so. Deputies are aware of my record on nuclear issues because I come here at regular intervals to account for my stewardship, which is as it should be. I have raised the profile of Ireland's anti-nuclear policy at every available opportunity. I have done so in this House, in the Irish and foreign media, in Brussels among our European Union partners, in Paris at the International Energy Agency, at meetings of OSPAR and at the United Nations. I have missed no opportunity to press our case with British Ministers both face-to-face and in writing.</P>
      <P>I have broadened and deepened our understandings with like-minded countries and built strong personal relationships with key Ministers from some of them. I have vigorously opposed the growing lobby by the nuclear industry to allow it to expand into developing countries under the name of climate change and Kyoto. I have raised awareness of that aspect and have repeatedly challenged at international fora attempts by the nuclear lobby to link nuclear power with sustainable energy sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make an important political point. The awful events of 11 September have highlighted new risks which were hitherto undreamed of. There is a huge onus on the countries that have populated <Col N="149" /> the planet with nuclear facilities to protect their installations from attack. They have an absolute duty to do everything possible, irrespective of the cost. It is unthinkable that new installations should be authorised before these issues have successfully been addressed.</P>
    <P>As colleagues are aware, the United Kingdom Government announced today that it will go ahead with the commissioning of the MOX plant at Sellafield. The decision is difficult to comprehend, especially in the light of recent tragic events. The rationale for nuclear energy should undergo a serious re-appraisal. It is a minimum expectation that countries with nuclear installations should consider the full implications of recent tragedies and the real and present safety and security dangers. A decision has been made that now, more than ever, must be questioned. The proposed plant has been the subject of frequent strong exchanges between the two Governments for many years. It is the subject of arbitration proceedings initiated by Ireland against the UK under the OSPAR Convention. When we initiated the arbitration process, we specifically asked that no decision to proceed would be taken while it was in progress and today's decision is contrary to that request.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that nuclear safety is a legitimate concern for countries that have chosen nuclear power. Close proximity to installations fully justifies concerns relating to plant operations, storage of waste, discharges into marine and terrestrial environments, the transportation of nuclear fuel and reprocessed materials and the threat of a major nuclear accident. This country's next step is to pursue legal options. I understand it will take months for the plant to be commissioned, so I will use that time to oversee the completion and processing of all legal options to bring this unacceptable decision under scrutiny, under both EU and UN law. This process is well advanced, and the matter is moving on to a higher legal level.</P>
    <P>Emergency planning in Ireland for nuclear accidents or incidents is a normal function of Government, but naturally attention becomes much more focused at times like this. Our national emergency plan in the event of a nuclear accident is the product of years of learning and review. It is not the plan of any one Minister and therefore not my plan. It represents the accumulated input of Ministers who had responsibility for energy over many years. It was improved dramatically after the lessons from the Chernobyl accident and the monitoring stations around the coast in particular are a direct legacy from that time. Likewise, the current plan, published in 1992 has been undergoing review and testing over the past two years and an up-dated plan will be ready for publication towards the end of the year. The international planning background and early warning systems have also been strengthened since Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>The threat posed by a serious nuclear accident comes directly from the radioactive materials <Col N="150" /> emitted in the atmosphere. The scale of the release will be directly related to the scale of the accident. What happens after that is determined by the prevailing weather conditions, such as wind speed and direction, and rainfall. The latter can have a major influence on depositions of radioactive contamination.</P>
    <P>Under international and bilateral arrangements we will be warned promptly of any serious incidents. The primary route is via the Garda communications centre but there are personal contact points as back-up. One member of the senior management team of the Radiological Protection Institute is permanently on call to make the initial decision about triggering the emergency plan.</P>
    <P>What happens next is that the emergency response co-ordinating committee goes into immediate session in a central control room. Armed with information from the RPII and other agencies &ndash; notably the meteorological service, because prevailing weather conditions will play a vital role &ndash; this committee, with representatives of key Departments and State agencies, will decide on and co-ordinate the implementation of counter measures and public safety advice.</P>
    <P>Providing accurate information and advice to the public is a major concern. If there were a nuclear accident for instance in Sellafield, it could take anything from hours to days for radioactive materials to contaminate Ireland, depending on weather conditions. Information will be released throughout the course of the emergency by the RPII using national radio and television and the Internet. The public should stay tuned to bulletins which will provide information and best advice on a frequent basis.</P>
    <P>The national plan as it stands, while giving basic advice to the population, is, like any other emergency plan, a document setting out who is responsible for what, detailed institutional prescriptions as to who does what, how key people are to be contacted and mustered, where they assemble and what their roles will be. It includes information gathering, sampling of air quality and the natural environment and, most importantly of all, communicating with the public.</P>
    <P>If there is an incident and if the wind is blowing in our direction, the contamination will take some period of time to arrive here. That period can be estimated and taken advantage of. We can identify the areas most likely to be affected, as it would be unusual if the entire country was similarly affected. There will be time, for example, to get animals indoors and perhaps to take some limited steps to protect their feed in order to protect the food chain. I know the notion has been derided, but the most practical step an individual can take is to shelter from contamination; the more layers of shelter the better. All these matters and more are dealt with in the plan. The Departments and agencies directly involved have their own sub-plans setting out actions and responsibilities in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>Now to the new plan. I have spoken about a <Col N="151" /> fact sheet. As I said already, any emergency plan is institutional in nature and not of specific interest to the population in general. It is, however, possible to condense the necessary advice to citizens into a short document and produce it on both sides of a single laminated page. A draft of this fact sheet already exists and we will distribute that to every household when it is finalised. We decided this some months ago and the full plan itself will be published and available by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my deepest and heartfelt sympathy with the families of the thousands of victims of these atrocities in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. The date of 11 September will forever remain in the mind. It is a day that marks an attack not just on America but on the civilised world as a whole, on democracy and on the many nations, such as ours, whose people have emigrated to the United States for work and a better way of life.</P>
      <P>Many of the victims of this barbaric attack were Irish or of Irish descent; 2,000 Irish people or people of Irish descent lost their lives. As we know, 45 million Americans claim Irish as their ethnic group. We in Ireland have deep personal and family links with the United States over generations. There are very few people in this country who do not have people in America. We have many other ties with America in investment, industry, trade and politics but it is this special and unique relationship between our people that bonds our two countries and that is why we in Ireland feel their loss so greatly and personally.</P>
      <P>Ireland now takes over the chair of the UN Security Council at a most difficult and challenging time and I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs well for the next 12 months. I hope everything goes well for him. We must strengthen our intelligence efforts against terrorism and emphasise the importance of a genuine European judicial area. It is essential that Europe be effective in fighting the threat of terrorism.</P>
      <P>We must have confidence in the ability of the American Government to make the right decisions and to ensure innocent civilian casualties are avoided in this war. We know the extent of the support the United States has given the peace process in Ireland. The Taoiseach has, on our behalf, expressed our solidarity with President Bush, Congressmen, Senators and the entire American people, sentiments I reiterate. I pay tribute to the rescue workers, particularly the fire-fighters, police, doctors, nurses and paramedics as well as the voluntary workers trying to find their loved ones. Many rescue workers unfortunately lost their lives and as a former emigrant to the United States I know of the many Irish people in both the fire and police departments in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has suffered more than most at the hands of terrorism and we must play our part in the fight against this evil. There can be no justifi<Col N="152" /> cation for cold-blooded murder and it is important that we in Ireland make our contribution to the international efforts such as those of the UN and through our relationship with the United States.</P>
    <P>A neighbour of mine, Kieran Gorman, is one of the men who is missing in New York. He was on holidays in Ireland and he returned to America on Monday 10 September, the day before the horrific accident. He went to work on 11 September and he has been missing since. I sympathise with his young wife, who was home on holidays with him, and his two children. I also sympathise with his mother Ann, his sister Ann-Marie and his brothers Eamon, John and Michael. He played football for Sligo and for his local club at home but he is now one of the thousands missing in the rubble of the twin towers. He was a hard worker and loved working in America but his ambition was to return to Ireland in a couple of years.</P>
    <P>I also wish to sympathise with a neighbour of mine whose son, who emigrated to the United States as she herself had in the 1960s, was lost in this tragedy. This is a tragedy for the families of Irish people and those of other nationalities who were lost in the horrific events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>People love to travel to America. I visited the Twin Towers in New York on two occasions and was impressed, as were many others, by their beauty. Who would have believed that so many lives would be lost there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute, however briefly, to this important debate. The horrific scenes from New York will change people's lives forever. We now know that international terrorism has the capacity to inflict damage of unimaginable proportions. Nobody could have foreseen the recent atrocities. Terrorism on that scale can only be defeated through the closest co-operation at international level. It will involve intensive intelligence and security co-operation, coherent diplomatic and political strategy and co-operation between financial institutions to stop the flow of funding. It may also involve focused military intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the campaign against terrorism is to be successful, it must be carried out under the auspices of the United Nations with the widest possible participation of the international community. I concur with the comments made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins who stated that in order for it to be effective, the campaign against terrorism must also respect the principles of international law and show particular consideration for innocent people who may be caught up in any military response to terrorism. The clearest demonstration of success in the fight against terrorism <Col N="153" /> would be the bringing before the International Criminal Court of the people who planned the outrageous events in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.</P>
    <P>On a wider front, the international community must respond with effective policies to the great pools of human misery and despair which provide a support base for terrorists. Ireland should provide a substantial sum of money &ndash; perhaps of the order of £10 million &ndash; towards the plight of refugees in Afghanistan. I acknowledge the contribution of more than £2.5 million, but, given our crucial role as chair of the UN Security Council which will allow us to play a very significant role in the weeks and months ahead, the figure should be increased.</P>
    <P>The single most important contribution we at home can make to the defeat of international terrorism is the withdrawal of support for terrorist groups on this island. We must reject without ambiguity or ambivalence the IRA, UDA, UVF, Real IRA and other terrorist groups which have brought nothing but suffering and misery to Irish people. The time has come for all such groups to disarm and disband. Security and intelligence services here must pursue a vigorous policy to discover and destroy illegal arms dumps, some of which, I regret to say, are located in my own constituency of Laoighis-Offaly. I urge people throughout that rural, two county constituency to offer their full co-operation to the Garda as there is no room for ambivalence on the issue of terrorism.</P>
    <P>There must be maximum co-operation at international level to stem the flow of money, arms and logistical support to terrorist groups. I listened with interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, refer to his famous plan, copies of which should be immediately laid in the Oireachtas Library and distributed throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn without reservation the atrocities in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September and sympathise with the families of the people who died in the Twin Towers, on the aircrafts and in the Pentagon and those of the members of the police and emergency services who died in the rescue attempts. According to Deputy Gerry Reynolds, up to 7,000 people may have lost their lives.</P>
      <P>I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish Consulate and other associations and individuals in the United States who made information available speedily and kept us apprised of the position. Many of us envisaged a worse outcome, although that is not to detract from the sadness of people such as Deputy Reynolds who lost two cousins in the disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> The murder of Martin O'Hagan in Lurgan is a further terrorist atrocity which must be condemned. The United States has been very good to Ireland during the years, but particularly during the peace process. Like the United States and its allies, we must do all we can to deal with terrorism. I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs well in his activities and discussions in the coming month.</P>
    <P>It is important to target bank accounts and other means through which terrorists are funded. The Fine Gael Party has condemned all manner of violence during the years and has not done so as a means of political opportunism or because we want to safeguard funding from the United States or elsewhere. We have condemned atrocities such as the Omagh and Dublin-Monaghan bombings, together with other acts of terrorism throughout the world. The USA, Britain and their allies now have an opportunity to ensure terrorism, wherever it exists, is dealt a death blow. Democracy is the way forward. Those who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement did so because they wanted to go down the road of democracy. The United States, which was very helpful during the process, will watch with interest to see whether all the terms of the Agreement are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The issue of decommissioning has not been addressed in any serious way by any of the paramilitary organisations. Unlike others, I have never had any hang-ups about the decommissioning issue as I believed matters would be rectified over time. However, I had a major hang-up about those who were in jail for committing heinous crimes being released. The people who signed the Agreement which resulted in their release must now address its other terms. While armaments in bunkers may not currently be in use, they are dangerous and must be destroyed. It is important that those who are aware of the location of arms dumps provide that information for the authorities. If that does happen voluntarily in the near future, the forces of law and order in this country must deal with the matter if we are to avoid further heinous crimes being committed in future.</P>
    <P>Once again, I sympathise with the families of those who lost their lives and with those injured in the recent atrocities. We all hoped Omagh would mark the end of the atrocities in Northern Ireland and can only hope the recent dreadful deeds in the United States will bring those who oppose terrorism together to ensure it is rooted out.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the roots of terrorism and make sure we play our part in rectifying the wrongs of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall being a member of a European delegation to America in the early 1980s. During a security briefing in the Pentagon, I asked what would happen if somebody tried to fly a plane in here and the answer given was &ldquo;Let them try&rdquo;. A reporter in <i>Time Magazine </i>recently <Col N="155" /> wrote: &ldquo;If you want to humble an empire, then strike at its cathedrals.&rdquo; This is what happened in</P>
      <P>the single greatest act of terrorism the world has ever seen, when the symbols of world trade were demolished in New York on 11 September. In the midst of all the grief, depression and poignant pictures, I am reminded of the words of a 68 year old man who made his way down from one of the top floors and spoke to his son, a journalist, who wrote in <i>The Observer </i>that, until the day he dies, he will remember the faces of the firemen, young, strong, committed, dedicated and going up to certain death while everybody else tried to make their way down in fear and confusion.</P>
      <P>This country has a unique opportunity, in chairing the UN Security Council, to influence world events at this time. Ireland was given this opportunity because of its reputation as a politically neutral country &ndash; politically neutral, yes, but not in spirit or, indeed, in participation or action. Ireland should press for a truly massive humanitarian response to what is about to happen, both as a role model for the future and in relation to other current problems in locations around the globe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support all the efforts to deal with terrorism, but there are also lessons to be learned in this regard. Maybe it is possible to bomb Afghanistan flat, decimate the Taliban and allow another regime to take up office, but if a suicide bomber walks into a restaurant in Hollywood next day and blows up another American icon, then the same paranoia will occur all over again. The problems and the root causes of all this must be examined. I was a member of a delegation which visited Jerusalem and the West Bank last year. There is no shortage of child suicide bombers lining up, because they and their people have lived in abject squalor for the past 50 years. When Israeli sewage and Israeli rubbish is left on the streets or when those people are moved at somebody's whim so that houses can be built, it is no wonder that the element of deep frustration manifests itself in the only way that is possible to people who have nothing left. I heard the former Israeli prime minister Netanyahu say &ldquo;Arafat is our bin Laden, it's time to stop looking for the needle in the haystack &ndash; take out the haystack&rdquo;. Deputy Cowen, a man of considerable political skill, has an opportunity to let the US understand that, in this time of world crisis inflicted on all peoples as a result of what happened in America, there can be a new understanding of the root causes of this terrorism in some other countries &ndash; perhaps because of elements of foreign policy over the years. In relation to the oil for food programme in Iraq, despite Hussein's refusal to allow inspection checks for nuclear weapons, there should be a clear position on humanitarian relief. Ireland could lead on this issue. We, among other nations of the world, do not want to see children die of disease and malnutrition. There should be humanitarian expeditions, to ensure practical <Col N="156" /> effect is given to that part of the programme which gives sufficient money to the Iraqi nation to allow hundreds of thousands of young people to live.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be ongoing threats of further incidents at the end of this year. While American people are very patriotic, they are also paranoid. Where 50 jets per day once travelled the Lockerbie run to the US, there are now three or four. Buildings are being evacuated every day in the US because of false alarm calls. This is a time of great crisis. In addition to the necessity to deal with terrorism in all its forms, in so far as that is possible in the long-term, Ireland's chairmanship of the UN Security Council can point out the necessity for understanding and the necessity for education and show that as a politically neutral country, we can be at the forefront in demonstrating that the world is a good place to live and that humanitarian relief can be effective in saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. People should no longer have to look aghast at television pictures of the faces of poverty, children maimed by land mines and refugees fleeing in terror. We have an enormous capacity to do a great job. Our reputation is quite disproportionate to our population. I hope our role in the Security Council will bear fruit in a truly global sense at this awful time for humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Michael O'Kennedy. On many occasions in the past 30 years in this House, we had to condemn atrocities of all kinds which resulted in the killing of innocent people. During these debates, I realised how difficult it was to put into words the feelings of horror and anger that we all experience in the aftermath of such appalling events. Tonight, as we discuss the outrageous terrorist attacks of 11 September on the United States, it is even more difficult. It is hard to comprehend the unbelievable callousness of the perpetrators, the scale of the destruction and the enormous number of innocent lives so cruelly lost. Almost 7,000 ordinary people &ndash; mothers, fathers, sons and daughters from more than 80 nations &ndash; were obliterated in a very short space of time. The world has never witnessed anything like this previously. Civilised people everywhere condemn it in the strongest possible terms and must unite to ensure that it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always enjoyed the strongest possible links with the United States. Since the attacks, these economic, social, cultural and historical ties have been revisited and articulated and are clear for everyone to observe. Nobody in this country can now have any doubt that the USA has our total support at this time in defending itself and defending democracy generally throughout the civilised world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said &ndash; and it is undeniably true &ndash; that September 11 changed everything. The world, in many respects, is now seen differently. Globalisation is now a reality for everyone. Ter<Col N="157" /> rorism is now clearly seen as an international phenomenon which has to be tackled by governments collectively, with a consequent loss of some of the civil liberties which we previously enjoyed. Local peculiarities in various countries, including this one, can no longer be tolerated in this new world. The attacks on the USA and the changed international situation which this has brought about, leaves loyalist paramilitaries, as well as Sinn Féin and the IRA, with serious dilemmas. Members of the IRA were trained in middle eastern countries and their arms have also come from that area. As we know, three suspected IRA men were recently arrested in Colombia, with the suggestion that they were helping FARC guerrillas there. Against that background, the IRA still refuses to advance its obligations to decommission, as it is obliged to do under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not surprising, therefore, that the US administration is reviewing its attitude to Sinn Féin. More importantly, however, in view of the changed international circumstances, many in this country are also becoming increasingly critical of, and impatient with Sinn Féin, having regard to the current deadlock in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The issue of Irish neutrality has once again been raised in the context of this debate and, as always, some confusion has arisen in this regard. However, the position is clear. Irish neutrality means the avoidance of military alliances. It does not, and did not ever, mean this country opting out of international affairs. Our participation in the United Nations, Partnership for Peace, the EU rapid reaction force and peacekeeping throughout the world generally is evidence of this.</P>
    <P>It must also be said that we have always accepted agreed United Nations resolutions and sought to implement them. This has resulted in our making available our airports and airspace to other countries and that is the case on this occasion as well. We are all not neutral against terrorism, that is, we do not support terrorism. That is obvious. A new type of war has been declared &ndash; a war on terrorism &ndash; and we should fully participate in it. That does not necessitate us joining a military alliance.</P>
    <P>The response of the United States to date has been the correct one. Statements from the US Administration have been measured and well thought out. Consultations have taken place with NATO countries and other countries as well as the United Nations in relation to this situation. There has been no indiscriminate and impulsive response resulting in the killing of innocent people. The talk now is of a clear, focused, proportional and targeted response against the terrorists and the undemocratic rulers who harbour them. I welcome that. In all this discussion too Ireland has called for a massive humanitarian effort to get under way in Afghanistan. I welcome this also.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, well in his <Col N="158" /> endeavours to bring about peace and stability in the world in accordance with international law in the difficult weeks ahead as Ireland takes over the chair of the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the observation, in the first instance, that the matter as described on the Order Paper is inappropriate because it refers to statements regarding the United States situation. It is much bigger and broader than that. While the United States of America and its people may have been the most direct target and suffered directly as a result of this latest atrocious action on the part of the terrorists, it is, nonetheless, an issue that affects, not only the United States, but all of us. This country particularly has reason to be indebted to the United States. The irony is that if one was to select a city in which to attack the peoples of the world, one would select New York because it has always been the haven for the oppressed, the deprived and those who have had to flee various regimes for one reason or another. To that extent, what happened in New York underlines our interdependence and vulnerability and requires us to take a common action on a range of fronts. I would like to address some of those points at this stage.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it is not just a matter, simply, of support. Although I did not see the programme last evening, I am told that a retired chief of staff in this country said that Ireland is not a powerful nation in this issue. How wrong he was. He could not have been further from the truth. We are a powerful nation, but powerful only in relation to the principles and consistency we have always followed and should follow. Power is not, in this instance, our influence to be determined by our military strength or armaments. It is up to us, the political representatives of the people, to repudiate statements of that kind and indicate that our power derives from something much stronger than guns and armaments &ndash; it derives from the obligations and respect we have and the positions we have followed during the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, our authority, and our obligation that derives from it, has always been based on principles. Before this horrific event in New York, the Minister outlined the priorities for Ireland during our presidency of the Security Council and our membership. Not surprisingly, those priorities were disarmament, which has always been one of our constant priorities, and fundamental human rights, which means protecting, advancing and enhancing the rights of every citizen, particularly those who have been deprived for one reason or another &ndash; deprived wretches who always suffer whenever military firepower is brought into play. Finally, let us never forget in this context &ndash; the Minister has underlined this also &ndash; that fundamental rights are universal and indivisible. Whether we see what happens to the poor children in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq or wherever, if they are deprived by any international actions, that is an offence <Col N="159" /> against the family of nations and the principles for which we have stood.</P>
    <P>If there were two things that struck me about the awful scenes in New York &ndash; I left here that very day and when I arrived in France I saw these awful scenes &ndash; one was the sheer horror of planes literally being torpedoed through the workplace of people in New York and the awful unthinkable consequences of that awful horror, while the other was the elation, the celebration visible on the streets of many of the Arab countries with youngsters jumping for joy, burning American flags and the effigy of the American President. That raises a question. Why are we not asking why is that a spontaneous response of these people to the United States of America and its President? That is where we have a special obligation.</P>
    <P>When I look at this question of common action against terrorism, we have to be consistent, effective in whatever way is required, particularly in relation to our position at home. There can be no ambiguity. As far as all of us are concerned, if there was never a question of decommissioning in the Good Friday Agreement, those who claim to be entitled to sit as political representatives have no right to claim that if there is somewhere behind them an army or an illegal force of weaponry that gives them a different influence, a vicious influence that the rest of us in political democracy do not call on. Therefore, it is way beyond time that any illusion about this link has to be totally and utterly rejected. Condemnation of what we have been condemning here should also be directed directly, consistently and constantly against those who perpetrate those events as well.</P>
    <P>We have to have consistency in relation to human rights whatever actions we take now. Let us not forget the scandal about which some of us in this House and at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs have talked for some considerable time &ndash; the unspeakable scandal of the export of armaments to various repressive regimes and freedom fighters, if such one calls them. It is a terrible irony that the sources of some of this awful suffering and fundamental madness of one form or another have benefited, and not in the too distant past, from weaponry and armaments supplied to them by the western nations &ndash; our partners. The questions were not asked when Iran and Iraq were being supplied with armaments by our partners. In one case, when one of our partners was supplying both sides in that war, who asked the questions? Did we care about the children who were being deprived, destroyed by that? If these tragic events that have come on to our screens and have hit one of the most welcoming cities in the world for all the peoples of the world do not now make us think of our obligations as a community of nations consistent with what we have always adopted at the United Nations, then we will not have learned a lesson.</P>
    <P>We, in the West, have a lot to answer for. We <Col N="160" /> have to answer for the supply of armaments to those people now because they were against the former enemy, the communist regime or whatever and for the supply of support for the most genocidal regimes of recent times, that of Pol Pot, because it was against the Vietnamese. All of these inconsistencies must be faced, in addition to facing up to whatever direct action must to be taken.</P>
    <P>We must recognise above all else that one man's holy war is another man's total and utter abomination. While we may all recall sayings such as &ldquo;God save Ireland, say the heroes&rdquo;, etc., we must be conscious that we need to understand what goes on in the minds of people who think their God justifies their actions and calls on them to destroy what they see as repressive regimes.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in what Deputy Kenny said. While I was in France I had the opportunity to read a number of extracts from statements made by bin Laden during the past five or six years. He regularly signalled that because the United States was lining up behind what he saw as an Israeli regime that was repressing the Palestinian people, it was now a legitimate target. In his eyes, it was part of the evil he perceived.</P>
    <P>There can be holy wars for various causes, but the only cause that will stand the test of time and will vindicate the concept of justice is that based on the principles we have always followed. I hope and I am confident, particularly in light of what the Minister has already done at the United Nations, that the unique role and responsibility with which we have been presented will be discharged. Action may be needed to deal with terrorism in one form or another, but the one action we should seek in order to lay a firm and permanent foundation for the future is action against injustice throughout the world and a vindication of the fundamental rights of all peoples. If we achieve this, we will, I hope, never again witness the insane reactions we have seen in recent weeks.</P>

      <P>In all my years in this House, I cannot recall any other occasion when I agreed 100% with every word uttered by Deputy O'Kennedy. In itself, that is an interesting comment to make on the thought process in which we are all engaged.</P>
      <P>What happened in the United States on 11 September was historically abominable and appalling. It was premeditated mass murder on an unprecedented scale and it has shaken all of us to the core. Many people in this House and elsewhere have stated that these dreadful acts have changed all. Nothing remains as it was before the unspeakable barbarism that was carried out in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. What do we mean when we say that all has changed? What radical reforms will come to pass in response to this palpable evil? For every nation, people and parliament, this question is real and urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> There must be a concerted and strong action against international terrorism. All of us face the same threat of attack and those who have no regard for human life &ndash; not even their own &ndash; must be called to account for the murderous deeds that were carried out. This must be done within the rule of international law, however, otherwise we will descend to the same level of anarchic barbarism that we so vociferously and rightly condemn. That will be no easy achievement, it will be no simple or cost free action. It is not a matter of issuing a summons to bin Laden, his cohorts or his fellow travellers, particularly because he is comforted and cosseted in Afghanistan by one of the most oppressive regimes in the world, namely, the Taliban. The latter's record on human rights and on the oppression of women has probably been unsurpassed during the past 100 years.</P>
    <P>The Taliban is worthy of our total condemnation for its actions in relation to its own people. However, if it harbours mass murderers then it must also be called to account. The people of Afghanistan are themselves victims of the Taliban. As one commentator stated, they were its first victims. It has also been stated by many people that any response must be measured and proportionate. What does that mean? We must remember that people's systems of measurement might be quite different. The Afghan people must not be made to suffer any more because they have already endured more than is bearable from the vicious regime that is the Taliban. They must not suffer further on foot of the righteous anger felt by the international community.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers indicated, so far, the United States has been responsible and measured in its approach. Many believed that the American people would demand instant retaliation and that the current American Administration would pander readily to that demand. However, that has not been the case. In fairness to it, the current Administration in the US has sought to build an international coalition to engage in a common operation which will, I hope, be carried out within the framework of international law.</P>
    <P>International action must go beyond even the issue of terrorism. That is a strand of opinion that has resonated through many of the contributions made during the course of this debate. If any good is to come from these awful events &ndash; it is strange to talk of good coming from such awfulness &ndash; it must do so through international action and the reform of international relations. Such relations must be reformed and strengthened. That old Irish maxim &ldquo;Ní neart go cur le chéile&rdquo;, is a truism. The rule of civilised law must prevail in the world. It has not prevailed. What has happened for many hundreds of years is that the might has always been right and the weak have always been victims of the strong, who often pursued their proxy wars to the detriment of the innocent.</P>
    <P>The international rule of law can prevail when international structures are built strong enough <Col N="162" /> not only to be heard but also to enforce the rule of law. Those of us who support and endorse the United Nations can no longer allow that organisation to be a voice of reason on the sidelines, to be disregarded by the strong whenever their own personal or political interests require it. There must now be a genuine new moral order. That is not a fanciful idea, but it is a tall order and some would say an impossible dream. Drawn up by the framers of the League of Nations and the builders of the United Nations in the aftermath of the Second World War, this ideal can become a reality.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to the expressions of sympathy extended to our colleague Deputy Gerry Reynolds on his family's loss. I strongly concur with the final comments he made during his contribution. It must be difficult for him to be in any way dispassionate in a debate of this nature. However, his final comments were in support of democracy itself. That is a clarion cry which we need not only to repeat, but to enforce because cynicism is rife among those who reflect and commentate on politics and the activities of Members and the general public. Our democracy is far from perfect, but it is a heck of a lot better than any alternative on offer. Our democracy is fragile. Faith in our democratic institutions can be shaken to its foundations as readily as the twin towers in New York. Those of us who are democrats and attracted to the honourable and noble profession of politics need also to defend loudly our democratic institutions in a time of cynicism and fear.</P>
    <P>I refer to Ireland's response. The Minister announced following his meeting with the Secretary of State that the United States would have access to Irish airports and airspace. I regret that offer was made without reference to the House. There are differences of opinion on that matter within parties as well as between the Government and the Opposition. However, there should be a respect for the House by allowing for such matters to be debated here. I also read in the newspapers that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attended a Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting and agreed up to 40 measures that will impact on our citizens. Opposition spokespersons on justice have no notion about what is contained in those recommendations or decisions. The new justice committee which was established to be more proactive in terms of the rights of Parliament has not and will not be consulted on these matters, many of which are to become law before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Those of us who talk about democracy and its institutions must respect the House and the will of the people, whether we agree with it, as voiced by the disparate voices in the House, all of whom have a validity by dint of their electoral mandate. I want a debate on all these matters and the House to be respected. Respect for the House has been absent in the initial responses of the Government. I regret the series of decisions taken. They were not shared with the House in the special session that was held. It was disre<Col N="163" /> spectful to the Members who were excluded from expressing their views on this important decision to recall the House for 90 minutes. A Government that is endorsed and strengthened by the views of the House is stronger when it presents its case at any international forum.</P>
    <P>Fundamental issues are being decided in the justice package, including ones which have long been fraught with difficulties in Ireland such as extradition, the concept of investigative detention, which is common in other jurisdictions within the European Union, and personal freedoms and privacy in the areas of communication, travel and so on. These are not minor matters which can be ignored in the context of this awful tragedy. They must be debated carefully and fully, otherwise at the end of the day the terrorists will win if freedoms that are the very characteristic of a free and open society are trampled on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in what the Government plans to do in regard to a number of issues in the fight against terrorism. I refer to UN Security Council Resolution 1373, which requires all member states to freeze without delay funds and other financial assets and resources of persons who commit or attempt to commit terrorist acts. Bearing in mind the &ldquo;collection&rdquo; of funds by terrorist organisations through tobacco and alcohol heists in recent times, what steps will be taken by the Government pursuant to the UN resolution, for which it has responsibility, to implement the provisions of the resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to paragraph 6 of the resolution under which it was decided to establish in accordance with rule 28 of its provisional rules of pro<Col N="164" /> cedure a committee of the Security Council consisting of all the members of the Council to monitor implementation of the resolution with the assistance of appropriate expertise and call upon states to report to the committee no later than 90 days after the date of adoption of the resolution and thereafter according to a timetable to be proposed by the committee on the steps it has taken to implement the resolution and paragraph 7, which directs the committee to lineate its tasks, submit a work programme within 30 days of the adoption of the resolution and consider the support it requires in consultation with the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee is in the process of being established. It will set out the work programme and what is expected of member states under the terms of the resolution. Subsequently, deadlines will be decided by the committee regarding whatever information is required from each member state. The purpose of the committee will be to paint a picture for the Security Council. It will not take over the role of the Council. Although it is a committee of the whole, it will set out what is required of all members logistically in terms of the information needed and so on. It will then report to the Security Council. I must await the establishment of the monitoring committee before I can give accurate and detailed responses to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his chairman of the Security Council hat on, but my questions are addressed to him as a representative of the Government. How will the Government react to the UN resolution? I understand the establishment of the committee from the Security Council perspective, but is the Minister not aware that the resolution, for which he has responsibility, involves each member state freezing without delay funds of terrorist organisations? What proposals has the Government to implement the provisions of Security Council Resolution 1373 in regard to freezing and otherwise seizing the assets of terrorist organisations? Is any estimate available of the extent of such assets? Are the whereabouts of the assets known? Will the Minister confirm that, apart from reporting to the Security Council on the steps being taken, a report will be made to this House on what steps are to be taken by Ireland to implement the resolution? I also ask the Minister to confirm that such a report will be available to the Dáil before it is brought to the UN Security Council. This would enable the House to input its views on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil will be kept informed in the usual way. It will be involved in terms of its usual question and answer sessions and committee work. This resolution arises out of Resolution 1368 where the terrorist acts of 11 September were regarded as threats to international peace and security. The resolution is primarily directed at the terrorist organisations that were involved in those attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> There is a recognition that we do not have a definition of terrorism <i>per se</i> in the UN conventions. There is a draft convention on terrorism. This is an Indian initiative but it is still at draft stage because it has not proved possible for 188 countries to reach a common definition of terrorism. In national legislation in the past, we named organisations and decided that they were engaged in terrorism. It was decided through our national laws how, for example, people who were members of the organisations would be indicted. In that instance, the word of a chief superintendent was sufficient.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the monitoring committee must be set up and it must set out the <i>modus operandi</i> of what is expected of member states. I assure the Deputy that Ireland will do everything in its power to comply with whatever is required by the monitoring committee in terms of its interpretation of what is necessary. The resolution is primarily, although not exclusively, directed at those organisations that were responsible for the terrorist acts on 11 September. Until that detail is available, we will comply in the normal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that no work has been done in terms of the freezing of assets of terrorist organisations in this country and that there is no intention of doing any such work until such time as the Security Council sets up the monitoring committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it that this country was very much involved in the drafting of the resolution and we support it unequivocally. As soon as the terms and width of the resolution are determined for us by the monitoring committee in terms of what is necessary, we will comply with it. I again say to the Deputy that this resolution arises from Resolution 1368, which is specifically directed at the threat to international peace and security that the attacks on</P>
      <P>11 September represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that what is afoot is a campaign in pursuance of the principle of the United Nations resolution rather than a war? Was it on that basis that he decided Article 28.3 of the Constitution does not apply? The atmosphere and language used at the time was one of war and there was no indication from the Minister or the Taoiseach that the offer was being made in pursuance of the United Nations resolution with guarantees.</P>
      <P>In terms of the Belgian Presidency's condemnation of Signor Berlusconi's remarks that Christian civilisation was superior to Islam, have his comments been criticised by all the member states of the European Union? Has the Minister had an opportunity to discuss with Signor Berlusconi's representative the possible appalling effect of the Italian Prime Minister's remarks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had that opportunity. I did not see the statement from the Belgian Presi<Col N="166" /> dency, but the Presidency usually speaks on behalf of the member states &ndash; 14 in this case. While I await confirmation of the translation, I would not subscribe to the premise that one civilisation is superior to another.</P>
      <P>In relation to the terminology being used, as I stated at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs today, the offer to the United States authorities does not mean Ireland is at war. Under Article 28.3.1º of the Constitution, war shall not be declared and Ireland shall not participate in any war save with the consent of Dáil Éireann. The Government is only acting to assist a concerted international response to deal with appalling acts of international terrorism. While this has been described in some quarters, as the Deputy adverted to with understandable emotion, as a &ldquo;war against terrorism&rdquo;, the question of Ireland participating in a war does not arise in the current circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify that the offer of any facilities does not include, for example, unilateral activity in support of the Northern Alliance? Arising from the European Council, there have been some reports that the co-ordinator of European foreign policy, Mr.</P>
      <P>Solana, had talks with former King Shah in terms of providing an alternative to the Taliban government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak about Mr. Javier Solana's discussions. There is a European Council of Ministers meeting next Monday and I will be better placed after that to give a view on the matter.</P>
      <P>We are not assisting the Northern Alliance in terms of our compliance with UN resolutions. We are supporting efforts to bring the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks to justice and to prevent further acts of terrorism as per Resolution 1368. The Taliban is clearly not committed to the UN in any event. Aside from these attacks, the UN Secretary General has reported to the Security Council about the need for a comprehensive approach to Afghanistan that would involve trying to set in place some form of dialogue that would allow for transitional arrangements to a more representative form of government and the need for the international community to assist an economy that has collapsed. This situation is very much on hold at present as the concern of the Security Council and the United Nations is to see if the Taliban will finally accede to a Security Council resolution which for the past three years has called for the hand over of bin Laden. The Deputy will be aware that the Pakistani Government was asked by the United States to act as interlocutor for that purpose since 11 September. However, it has proved unsuccessful.</P>

Any request for further details on that would be best directed to the Minister in a parliamentary question.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the decision made this evening to establish a reprocessing facility is not in Ireland's interest. I referred to the International Criminal Court earlier. When will Ireland ratify it? It is not under the ambit of his Department but, in terms of giving it priority, the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not to even include it in the legislative programme for the next two years is outrageous. Will the Minister indicate a date on which Ireland will ratify the Rome Statute to establish the International Criminal Court? Does he accept it is an essential part of the apparatus to bring international criminals to justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the referendum was passed by the people recently, legislation is required to enable Ireland ratify the statutes. I have been in contact with the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to a Bill being put before the House as quickly as possible. Complex issues are involved but they will be addressed in light of the seriousness of the situation in which we and the rest of the international community find ourselves. Some 60 ratifications are required for the ICC to commence its functions. The aim of the Government is to be among those 60 ratifying states.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>terrorist. Can we do something to remedy that outrageous decision to issue those passports? Can they be withdrawn? The Minister may say they could now be out of date. However, I am more interested in the naturalisation process. Can we withdraw the Irish citizenship and naturalisation offered to them in the early 1990s when the law was totally flouted and when decisions were made which were so suspect they are now before the <Col N="168" /> Moriarty tribunal? Can we withdraw them as part of our campaign against international terrorism? </P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>)<b>:</b> The United States alleges that the atrocity of 11 September and the murder of thousands of innocent people is the responsibility of Osama bin Laden and an organisation, al-Qaeda, which is based in Afghanistan. As chairman of the Security Council of the United Nations, have the grounds for this allegation been revealed to the Minister? Has he asked for the grounds for this allegation? Does he agree it is a reasonable demand that the grounds for this allegation should be published and brought to the world's attention? </P>

    <P>Has the United States asked for the use of Irish airports in any circumstances in which the United States might be taking military action following the events of 11 September?

    <P>When I spoke earlier I referred to Mr. Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, who has set himself up as the bounty hunter in chief in the search for Osama bin Laden. Does the Minister understand my cynicism about Mr. Blair's position, given that two years ago he had a mass murderer, Augusto Pinochet, in his custody and moved mountains to ensure he was returned safely to Chile? Can the Minister understand the cynicism of people like myself about these leaders of the western world who have set themselves up as the arch enemies of international terrorism, yet have facilitated horrific terror? Since coming to power only four years ago, Mr. Blair's Government has facilitated the Indonesian regime by arming it with weapons which resulted in the slaughter of people in East Timor. Mr. Bush, and the United States, has also armed other regimes which inflict terror on their people.

As regards the package of measures for which this country will legislate, will the international covenants and conventions we have yet to ratify, namely, the five of the 12 which pertain to this area, receive priority or will the justice package which has been agreed by the Home Affairs Council receive priority? How will the House be briefed not after the agreement to put specific measures in place, but before Ireland's commitment to particular measures is agreed? How will the Government address the democratic deficit we have identified in relation to these matters to ensure the greatest democratic scrutiny of any fundamental changes, particularly in areas of civil liberties, that might flow from our response to the atrocities of 11 September? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The date 11 September means that priority must now be given to the legislative arrangements which must be made in terms of international agreements which have been signed by us and which are awaiting ratification and which in the normal course of events would come through the system. There is a need to prioritise to some extent a lot of that work, particularly in relation to the international convention on the financing of terrorism which was identified by the <Col N="170" /> Government at this week's meeting as one which requires a lot of prioritisation, which it will receive.</P>
      <P>As regards the justice and home affairs issues, I understand the Opposition spokespersons' concerns in these matters. It is a matter for the work of the committee system and I am sure they can be worked out in some way. Whether it is totally satisfactory is always a matter of contention. I would like to see an opportunity being afforded to the Members of the House who are interested to voice their views on many of these questions. There is a time factor involved in terms of my Department in detailed procedures. The European Council committed itself to provide a package of measures for consideration by the European Council at Laken in December. There will be less time than would normally be available which will require us to organise our time as best we can in the House and the committee system to give these matters the type of attention they all deserve.</P>
      <P>As regards justice and home affairs, there are different common law systems, civil law systems and written and unwritten constitutions and the attempts to codify these areas can cause difficulties. I know that when the initial agenda items were considered by the Justice and Home Affairs Council as a result of the special European Council meeting these matters were put down to let people know there is detailed work to be done to ensure we cover all aspects of the concerns the Government and the Opposition have about these issues.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Joe Higgins's points, I am sorry I cannot explain the Deputy's total cynicism about a lot of things. There has not been a request on foot of the offer which has formally been made to America, in detail, substance or in a particular case about overflight or refuelling facilities, as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of evidence being available, it will be important with regard to the prospect of maintaining international support for any military option &ndash; should one be used &ndash; that it remains within the international legal framework and must be proportionate and targeted. In the words of the US Secretary of State, it will be careful and calibrated. The international coalition will be best preserved by making sure that as much evidence as possible can be made available. The intelligence considerations are obvious. We continue to keep in touch with the American authorities to be briefed by them, as fully as possible in the circumstances, about their thinking and where this intelligence will finally bring them. A number of the hijackers have been identified by video and other evidence. The people who boarded those flights were identified as trained associates working under the Al Qaeda network. They are well known members of Al Qaeda of whom the undoubted leader is Osama bin Laden. Based on his public pronouncements in the past, including interviews he has given, it would appear, even on <Col N="171" /> the basis of what is in the public domain, that Mr. bin Laden and his associates have a very serious case to answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Peerless Rug factory in Athy, County Kildare closed on 7 July with the loss of 65 jobs. Some of the workers who lost their jobs in that closure had been with the firm for 27 years. The workers were offered statutory redundancy payments only. They then found that moneys from a savings fund to which they had contributed were being returned to them in the form of cheques drawn on the company's account, but those cheques were not honoured. There is a question as to how moneys that were being routed into a savings account for the workers fell to be repaid by cheques on the company's account. I will return to that point in a moment.</P>
      <P>Many workers found that insurance premia, which they understood were being paid by deduction from their wages, had not been paid to the insurers for some time. I am not quite sure what the length of time was but it was certainly a period of some months.</P>
      <P>Prior to the closure of the plant in Athy, equipment was moved from that plant to another plant owned by the same principals. This was equipment that was required for making the products at the Athy plant. Today, products that were previously manufactured in Athy are being produced in other plants owned by the same principals.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that in addition to the shock of finding themselves unemployed, the workers from Peerless Rug feel a deep sense of injustice about how they have been treated. They took various kinds of action, including seeking an improvement in redundancy payments through the Labour Court. They did what the Government invariably recommends in dispute cases &ndash; they pursued the industrial relations machinery of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principals of the firm failed to attend either of two Labour Court hearings and in their absence the court recommended that the workers should be paid statutory redundancy plus three weeks per year of service. To date, no action on <Col N="172" /> this recommendation has been taken by the principals.</P>
    <P>Last month I wrote to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ask her what steps she would take to ensure compliance with the Labour Court's ruling. I received an acknowledgement dated 11 September, but nothing since then. I would like a substantive reply now. The workers demand such a reply. This is a particularly urgent matter since the workers used the industrial relations machinery of the State. They were vindicated by the Labour Court which made a recommendation but so far we have not seen any action on foot of the Labour Court's recommendation.  In the absence of the Tánaiste, perhaps the Minister of State can tell me whether any investigation has been carried out into the circumstances in which the workers' payments into a savings account appear to have gone into a company account rather than into a separate account? If such an investigation has been carried out, what have been the results and is any action contemplated? Is this a case of misapplication or misdirection of funds, or is something more serious involved? What are the obligations of the principals &ndash; who are still in business with several other companies &ndash; concerning insurance premia, apparently deducted from workers' pay cheques but not passed on to the insurers? </P>
    <P>I recognise that the Tánaiste met workers from Peerless Rug some time ago. She listened to them with apparent understanding, although I do not know if she listened with any sympathy. However, there has been no action so far from the Tánaiste. The workers used the State's industrial relations procedures and were vindicated. The Tánaiste must have had some purpose in mind when meeting them, so I want to know what action is being taken to give effect to the Labour Court's recommendation. What investigations, if any, have been undertaken into the savings fund and the insurance premia? Can the Minister of State give any indication of the action that is being taken to improve the lot of these workers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for having raised this matter. I am aware of the issues surrounding this case because I met briefly a number of the workers today when Deputy Power introduced them to me on a visit to Leinster House. As the Deputy is aware, in May this year Peerless Rug announced that the company would close on 20 July. The reasons given related to the competitive nature of the business, resources and associated costs. I am informed that the company offered to pay statutory redundancy entitlements to its employees but the offer was rejected by the employees who had sought 8.5 weeks pay per year of service in addition to statutory entitle<Col N="173" /> ments and the 2% increase payable under the PPF since 1 April this year.</P>
      <P>The issue was referred to the Labour Relations Commission and conciliation took place on 21 June. No agreement was reached and the dispute was then referred to the Labour Court. The matter was heard on 9 July, following which the court issued its recommendation. The company was represented at this hearing by its receiver who was appointed on 4 July. The court recommended that the company pay the employees three weeks pay per year of service plus statutory entitlements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Labour Court recommendations, I stress that the Labour Court is not a court of law. It operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in trade disputes and then issuing recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled. While these recommendations are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the court's recommendation. Ultimately, however, responsibility for the settlement of a dispute rests with the parties.</P>
      <P>My Department has no function under the Redundancy Payment Acts regarding payments over and above the statutory amounts. Responsibility for the payment of statutory redundancy entitlements rests with the employer, in the first instance. In the case of Peerless Rug, the receiver advised my Department in mid-July that the company was insolvent and unable to pay redundancy entitlements. Therefore, my Department paid all eligible employees their statutory lump sum from the social insurance fund calculated in accordance with the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991. I am pleased to inform the House that all statutory payments were made by the end of August.</P>
      <P>The Deputy acknowledged that the Minister visited Athy on 12 July and met the workers at Peerless Rugs. On 12 September she announced that Enterprise Ireland and FÁS would each provide £20,000 for Kildare County Council for the recruitment of an executive by the Athy investment, development and employment forum. This new executive will make a major contribution to the development of Athy and help develop a series of responses to the socio-economic issues being faced by the town.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes raised some issues regarding the savings fund and insurance. I will make inquiries and come back to the Deputy regarding these issues.</P>

      <P>This is an important issue which is of major concern to the people of Monaghan, namely, the continuing closure of Monaghan Poultry Products. This issue is of particular concern to the 300 workers, the growers, breeders and service industries.</P>
      <P>A total of 300 workers found themselves out of work without any notice. It is always traumatic for a workforce to lose their jobs, particularly when they have no forewarning. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, is aware of the sensitive nature of the poultry sector given that it deals with perishable goods. The growers found themselves in a state of upheaval because their regular market was cut off without notice. They had to look for markets and take reduced prices for their produce.</P>
      <P>The origin of the problem which led to the closure of the plant was detailed by the Department on 29 August and was due to the company's failure to comply with the EU poultry meat regulations of 1996. Slaughtering was suspended on 24 August and the factory has remained closed since. While I would have hoped that it would not have been necessary to close the plant, I recognise and agree with consumers who expect and demand the highest standards in food safety. The Department outlined the reasons for the closure in a detailed statement on 29 August.</P>
      <P>There was much activity following the closure of the plant which took place while the House was in recess. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, a number of times. I also spoke to the Taoiseach and officials in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I also met representatives of Monaghan Poultry Products on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>A special meeting of Monaghan Urban District Council was held on 27 August which I attended with Deputies Crawford and Ó Caoláin. However, the message was the same, namely, the necessary steps were a plan to correct the deficiencies identified by the Department with regard to EU regulations and a viable business plan for the future of the plant.</P>
      <P>The first plan prepared by reputable consultants was forwarded to the Department last week and officials will meet representatives of Monaghan Poultry Products later this week. It is for the company to submit a viable business plan to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. When the plan is received I appeal to the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure the survival of a production plant in County Monaghan which is the largest producer of poultry in the country. Food is the main economy of the county and it is essential for a viable industry that there is a processing plant in County Monaghan where two thirds of the country's poultry is produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that the poultry sector is going through a difficult period. We are importing <Col N="175" /> produce from the Netherlands, Britain and the European Union, but there are also significant imports from Brazil and Thailand. I appeal to the Minister to assist the sector to become more competitive and to find more markets. In particular, I ask him to consider the situation of the growers and breeders in County Monaghan as a result of what happened at Monaghan Poultry Products.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider all options for the future of poultry processing in County Monaghan. The first requirement is a proposal from the company regarding a viable business plan. However, the Minister should speak to the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, as we will do, to ask her to ensure the industry survives and that there is a processing plant. A task force might consider how the reopening of a plant in County</P>
    <P>Monaghan can be expedited.</P>
    <P>This is an urgent matter and I appeal to the Minister to assist in whatever way possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing us to raise this important issue and thank the Minister of State for coming into the House. Monaghan County Council made a request over a month ago for a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and I reiterate that request as it is even more urgent that he should meet a delegation from the council to discuss this major issue.</P>
      <P>A total of 300 workers lost their jobs in Monaghan Poultry Products and up to 150 others have been seriously affected. Poultry breeders were left in limbo and many chicken growers are left without outlets for their finished products. Some farmers are in desperation over prices being paid for their birds while other birds may have to be gassed as they are starving.</P>
      <P>I spoke to farmers today who do not know which way to turn. Many of the workers have served the firm for over 30 years, yet they have been left in limbo and with no answer as to whether or when they will receive even statutory redundancy or whether they will get their jobs back. The management is in the process of clearing its desks, if it has not already done so.</P>
      <P>I have not spoken to the management since it switched off the state-of-the-art hatchery which contained 800,000 eggs. The sewerage system was also switched off. To many this proved that the management had little commitment to the future.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the Government committed £450,000 grant aid to upgrade the plant. Breeders, growers and workers made sacrifices to match this money in order that necessary work could be carried out. I accept that the Department has a right to close the plant when this work had not been carried out. This was an integrated system built up over 30 years. Since it was the Minister who closed the plant for a genuine reason, he must accept some responsibility for the fact that so many people had their futures taken from them by a fax or the stroke of a pen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Department must take <Col N="176" /> some responsibility for the fact that, five weeks later, some growers cannot find a place to kill their birds, even from a welfare point of view. They must commit themselves to having the plant restructured and reopened immediately as there are people who are committed to doing so if the Minister meets them part of the way.</P>
    <P>Whether they have taken jobs, workers must receive proper redundancies and farmers and others who have lost a significant amount of money must be compensated. Successive Governments have done little to create or support jobs in County Monaghan. This is an opportunity to show some commitment. Major question marks hang over this company and the reason at least some work was not carried out in co-operation with the veterinarians and departmental officials. Two thirds of the poultry produced in Ireland is produced in Monaghan. It is unthinkable that the producers would be left without Monaghan Poultry Products Limited, the major plant in the area.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Crawford and O'Hanlon for sharing their time. We are on the brink of the final act in the closure of Monaghan Poultry Products Limited, one of the mainstays of the economy of County Monaghan, and of the entire Border region. All 300 hundred jobs will go. The closure to date has already deeply affected the livelihoods of the company's poultry suppliers, many of whom have been loyal to and reliant on this outlet. This is a devastating blow. On 23 August last, production at Monaghan Poultry Products Limited was suspended by order of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which cited alleged non-compliance with EU regulations. I have been in contact with SIPTU representatives, the management and the IFA at different times throughout the crisis. With my fellow County Monaghan based Deputies, I met representatives of the Department. We knew from the beginning that any long-term suspension of production could fatally undermine this operation leading to the loss of 300 jobs. The disastrous consequences for the more than 100 growers, breeder-growers, hauliers and others who supply and service the plant and the knock-on effect in ancillary services are a massive blow to the economy of County Monaghan and the entire region. The company was not on its own, able to make the large investment needed to comply with stringent EU requirements. That is, apparently, a fact. The company's plan presented in an application for aid to Enterprise Ireland was not deemed adequate by that body as advised in a communication received by management today. Does the Department also deem it insufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Closure is now apparently imminent. The Department and Enterprise Ireland have not exhaustively explored every avenue to save this plant. The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must intervene directly and must intervene now. They should work with those <Col N="177" /> committed to the plant's future, with SIPTU and the IFA to put together a rescue package and provide direct financial aid to ensure that the plant complies with all regulations and directives. That is not beyond the genius of the State's machinery. The primary concern must be the health and safety of the entire community of consumers. Producers must adhere to the highest standards and any failure to comply with them cannot be condoned. This is a requirement of all production plants. I trust there is even-handedness in the Department's efforts to ensure the implementation of such standards in all cases. In my native town and its hinterland tonight, many households face an uncertain future. Their worst fears about their employment status are being confirmed. If the worst transpires and Monaghan Poultry Products Limited closes for good, there must be an immediate response from the Government. It must be recognised that the jobs disaster is happening in a region starved of investment. There must be action to provide employment in County Monaghan. We will need more than yet another task force like those established after every such closure elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to lay the facts as they are before the House. It is important to note that in solving any problem, the first thing is to establish the facts and what actually occurred. It is obviously of concern when jobs are at risk, but we can only deal with these matters by facing the facts straight on and recognising realities. I place the realities before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the course of several years the premises of Monaghan Poultry Products Limited has been in receipt of a series of veterinary notices from this Department which have drawn attention to a range of operational and structural deficiencies requiring attention there. Many of these defects involve a lack of compliance with the standards laid down in the European Communities (Fresh Poultrymeat) Regulations, 1996, and European Community legislation governing the production of poultrymeat. These are the basic legal requirements aimed at ensuring the hygienic processing of food in the poultry sector and thus ultimately the protection of the final consumer. The situation culminated in my Department's issue on 20 August last of a notice under Regulation 12(7) of the regulations, temporarily suspending production at the plant. A meeting between the company and Department officials took place on 21 August at which the deficiencies in question were discussed. The company then drew up an action plan setting out the means by which it proposed to solve the problems, and on this basis the Department agreed to a trial production run on 23 August. Two Department senior veterinarians observed this trial and reported their findings. However, in view of the operational and structural shortcomings still in evidence, my Depart<Col N="178" /> ment decided immediately to reinstate the temporary suspension notice.</P>
    <P>The Department provided the company with a detailed statement on the defects in evidence at the plant and officials again met company representatives on 29 August. At that meeting the company accepted the Department's position in regard to the hygiene and food safety defects at the premises. Management opted to seek a complete and permanent solution to their problems rather than a piecemeal patching up approach and undertook to submit to the Department a comprehensive set of plans for the refurbishment of their plant. In this connection Monaghan Poultry Products Limited commissioned consulting engineers who produced a report on the existing production facility and recommendations for the upgrading of the plant. This report endorses the Department's findings with regard to the plant's deficiencies and clearly states that in its present state the facility does not comply with the current regulations. This report is currently being examined by the relevant Department personnel and a meeting with the company has been arranged for this Friday to discuss its contents.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the efforts which have been made by the company over the years to deal with their situation, it has become increasingly apparent that good food safety standards would not be achieved in the absence of a major investment by the company in structural upgrading. My Department has responsibility for monitoring the safety of meat produced in registered premises and to ensure that the legal food safety standards are fully met and maintained. This is non-negotiable. In light of other debates taking place in the House, everyone must accept that food safety is paramount. Having said that, I am also keenly aware of the very regrettable impact of the closure of the company on the work force and on people running hatcheries and supply farms connected to Monaghan Poultry Products Limited. The consultants' report details the significant costs involved in upgrading the premises and concludes that a major capital expenditure programme will be required to bring the existing facility up to a standard that would comply with the applicable legislation. It will be very much a matter for the company to address the question of funding any restructuring they intend to undertake.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is the authority that is primarily responsible for deciding whether any State investment aid would be appropriate in this case. I understand there has been ongoing contact with Enterprise Ireland and that the full details of the conditions applicable to any such aid have been made known to the company. In the early 1990s some £1.2 million of grant aid was approved by Enterprise Ireland for this company but these moneys were not ever paid as the company did not proceed with the specific projects for which they had planned to draw down this aid.</P>
    <P>Following the suspension of processing, suppliers and hatcheries affiliated to Monaghan <Col N="179" /> Poultry Products Limited were seriously inconvenienced. However, I understand that at this stage most of these problems have been resolved by various realignments within the industry. Surplus broilers have to a large extent been dealt with by increased production on the part of other processors both here and in Northern Ireland. The Deputies will appreciate that I am not in a position to direct any processor to take poultry that it does not want, but I understand that major efforts have been made by the sector to accommodate the displaced production resulting from <Col N="180" /> the Monaghan factory closure. I would ask any growers still affected to continue to actively seek outlets for their stock. I am glad to have this opportunity to reassure the House and everybody affected by the closure of this premises that I am fully aware of the difficulties that have been caused and that my Department will co-operate in every possible way with the company's efforts to reopen its plant.</P>

    <P>At this stage I am happy to be in a position to confirm that I have completed my review of the system for handling Garda complaints. On the basis of the review, I have developed proposals for appropriate legislative changes which I will publish in the near future.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he has concerns regarding the reported increase in attacks on the Muslim community as a result of the terrorist attacks in America; his plans to address this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of some media reports which have suggested that the recent appalling terrorist attacks in the United States of America may have acted as some kind of spur, albeit of a distorted and sickening kind, to the committal of offences against members of the Muslim community here.</P>
      <P>I am, naturally, deeply concerned to learn of such reports. However, I understand from the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to indicate that victimisation incidents among members of the Muslim community have increased since the terrorist attacks. Having said this, I acknowledge as real the fears of individual members of the Muslim community.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities further inform me that, since 11 September, two incidents have been reported to the Garda Síochána where the injured parties were Muslims. The first incident concerns the sending of a threatening letter on 18 September and this is currently under Garda investigation. The second incident relates to an alleged assault on 20 September. In connection with this incident, a person has been arrested and charged with an offence under section 3 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, and the matter is currently before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda Síochána that it understands the particular concerns of the Muslim community arising from recent events in America and that it is satisfied that the measures currently in place to meet that community's needs are adequate. On a broader perspective, over the past four years, the Government has introduced comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation and <Col N="183" /> other measures to combat racism and discrimination. Both the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, contain a broad definition of race that covers race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins.</P>
    <P>The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, in partnership with a range of non-government organisations, has organised a system of reporting racist incidents with the aim of providing a profile of the number, type and location of incidents that are occurring and to identify emerging trends. The Garda Síochána has been similarly proactive in devising strategies to deal with policing issues in a multicultural society, one measure of which is the establishment of the Garda racial and intercultural office. The function of this office is to liaise with racial and ethnic groups and so move diversity issues into the mainstream of contemporary policing practice. Last October, the Government agreed to my proposal to implement a national anti-racism public awareness programme with the overall aim of contributing to creating the conditions for building a more inclusive and intercultural society. In February, I announced the composition of the high level steering group to implement the programme, in partnership with the equality division of my Department.</P>
    <P>In May, the steering group launched a grant scheme to assist minority ethnic and religious groups, including the Muslim community, which are working to combat racism. I understand that the steering group has already sent a message to the Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh expressing solidarity during these difficult times and I know that the Taoiseach expressed similar sentiments when he visited that centre last Monday.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that the uncertainty and misunderstandings which may have arisen from recent events in America do not translate into intemperate and ignorant reactions indiscriminately addressed to the Muslim community here. I am confident that the range of measures currently in place will achieve this goal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 158, 937 and 964 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that since I took office there has been an unprecedented decrease in the level of serious crime as represented in the figures for indictable offences. However, I have also been concerned to ensure that we tackle the problem of the less serious non-indictable offences. That is the category into which most public order offences fall. I emphasise that while the offences in question are categorised traditionally as less serious, I am well aware of the scourge which this type of behaviour can cause in our communities.</P>
      <P>This is why one of my priorities has been a major crackdown on this type of crime. We can have no tolerance for the criminal activities of those who show no respect for other members of the community. Primarily, this has involved increased targeted activities by members of the Garda Síochána. I am glad to tell the House that the Garda authorities have provided some statistics for the period October 2000 to May 2001 which indicate the success of the national public order policing initiative. The terms &ldquo;public order offences&rdquo; and &ldquo;street violence&rdquo; do not correspond to a specific set of clearly defined offences. However, the bulk of the offences in question would be covered by the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period in question, some 50,984 offences, mainly of a non-violent nature, were detected by the Garda Síochána under various provisions of <Col N="185" /> the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended. The bulk of this figure comprises 22,382 detections for intoxication in a public place; 15,011 detections for threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour; 6,231 detections for failure to comply with a Garda direction; and 5,594 detections for disorderly conduct. It is important to make the point that, in analysing statistics in relation to public order offences, increased activity by the Garda has a bearing in relation to the number of offences recorded. The nature of some of these offences, such as intoxication in a public place, is such that they would be unlikely to be recorded unless detected by the Garda. Thus, the number of detections by the Garda constitutes a significant success on its part in responding to public concern about personal safety and security through targeted policing measures at specific hotspots of disorder.</P>
    <P>In relation to the details of these measures, the Garda Síochána's Operation Oíche has been deployed in cities and large towns since October 2000. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as part of this operation, each divisional officer compiled an operational plan which incorporated all initiatives and operations to combat public order problems and illicit drug use. I am further informed that additional plans to focus on public intoxication and underage drinking were also developed.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider the operation to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction, there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and nightclubs. In this regard, the Garda Síochána continues to visit licensed premises to impress an even greater awareness on the licensees of their responsibilities. I am further informed that, in Dublin, the new Dublin Corporation by-laws prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor on public streets have proven very effective.</P>
    <P>In relation to offences committed by juveniles, I am confident that the Children Act, 2001, which was signed into law on 6 July 2001, will constitute a significant response to addressing the behaviours and needs of out-of-control young people. In particular, the Act contains specific provisions in relation to the responsibilities of parents, such as the requirement on parents to take measures to remedy whatever it is that has caused them to lose control of their children. On a related note, I am continuing to oversee a dramatic increase in the number of Garda youth diversion projects, from 12 in 1997 to 52 at present, with more to follow.</P>
    <P>Moreover, as the Deputies may be aware, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, significantly strengthened the provisions against the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor to underage persons. To complement this, the age card scheme, which I launched last year, allows any person who has attained 18 years of age to apply for an age card at his/her local Garda station in order to confirm <Col N="186" /> that he or she has attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with other State agencies, is considering the recommendations of the Garda Síochána's Garda youth policy advisory group report which constitutes an important contribution to addressing the multi-faceted problem of alcohol abuse among young people.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputies that the national crime council is undertaking a major research project in relation to public order offences, which should significantly enhance the information available to us about the nature and patterning of this problem. The main statutory framework relating to public disorder and street violence, as set out in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, and relevant drugs legislation are being kept under continual review by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the responses of my Department and the Garda Síochána to the issue are comprehensive and appropriate and I am satisfied that they are producing and will continue to produce positive results.</P>

      <P>No decision has been made to close Shanganagh Castle. However, I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service that a group has been formed to examine the feasibility of continuing to operate this institution as a male juvenile open centre in the light of the considerable decline in committals to this centre over the past several years. As offenders in the age category considered suitable for an open centre are increasingly managed in the community and do not incur a custodial sentence, there has been a significant drop in the number of prisoners transferred to this institution.</P>
      <P>Should the review group conclude that it is not viable to continue to operate Shanganagh Castle in its current format, it is to consider all other options, including retaining the centre in the prison system for a different prisoner population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 950 together.</P>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I introduced and which came into effect on 6 July 2000, made provision for significant and far-reaching reforms of the State's liquor licensing laws. With a view to continuing the important work of reforming the liquor licensing code, which reaches back to the early part of the nineteenth century, I established the Commission on Liquor Licensing in November 2000 under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the commission are as follows: first, to review the liquor licensing system in the light of all relevant factors, including systems for the licensing of alcohol in other countries, and to make recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meeting the needs of consumers, in a competitive market environment, <Col N="188" /> while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society. Second, in particular, to review the scope for a system of additional licences; to examine demand in areas that are under-pubbed, new areas of increasing population and tourist areas; and to examine other aspects of the licensing system, such as licences for theatres and places of public entertainment, the licensing of residential accommodation which does not come under the definition of an hotel, interpretative centres and other places where the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main business carried out. Third, to examine the nature of the off-licence and particularly the method of access to the off-licensed trade in the interests of promoting better competition. Fourth, to inquire into other aspects of the licensing code, as may be appropriate. Fifth, to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes to give effect to the recommendations put forward and, sixth, to submit a report within three months of the first meeting on paragraph 3 of its terms of reference and a final report within two years of the first meeting on all other matters.</P>
    <P>In line with these terms of reference, the commission presented an interim report on off-licensing to me in April this year. The report contains recommendations relating to dormant licences, under-age drinking, off-licensing and certain related matters. I subsequently obtained Government approval to publish the interim report. By way of response to the substance of the commission's recommendations, the Government noted my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in relation to the off-licensed sector at the earliest opportunity. The preparatory work is at an early stage in my Department. This is not a simple task, however, given the complexity of existing legislation in this area &ndash; the commission itself refers in the interim report to &ldquo;the morass of licensing laws&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regards the recommendations not relating specifically to access to off-licences, the Government agreed that a co-ordinated response be developed by a high-level, inter-departmental working group of the Departments and agencies concerned. The working group presented its report at the end of June. I am happy to say that the Departments and agencies concerned have responded in a broadly positive and constructive way to the commission's recommendations and have indicated that they will be taking appropriate action to address them in due course. To underline the importance it attaches to the work of the Liquor Licensing Commission, the Government has requested the working group to present a progress report on all actions taken in response to the interim report's recommendations by 31 January 2002.</P>
    <P>The Government has also requested the commission to produce and submit additional interim reports on issues which can be progressed in advance of the commission's final report at the end of 2002. I am pleased to say that the commission has responded positively to this request <Col N="189" /> and I understand that a number of sub-committees have been established to look at specific areas within the liquor licensing code. The commission placed advertisements in national newspapers on 23 August last seeking submissions in relation to any aspect of the terms of reference and, in particular, to access to licences in urban and suburban centres of population; off-licence sales in convenience stores attached to garage forecourts; nightclubs, theatres and places of public entertainment and related public order issues; and registered clubs. I understand that the Commission is unable to say at present when further interim reports are likely to be ready for submission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period 1997 to date, a total of 3,910 applications for certificates of naturalisation were received. In the same period, a total of 1,766 persons received certificates of naturalisation. In addition, there are 159 applications which I have approved and which are awaiting finalisation of some formalities by the applicants &ndash; payment of the statutory fee, etc. A further 147 applications were refused in the same period. Consequently, the total number of applications for Irish citizenship by way of naturalisation currently pending is 1,838.</P>
      <P>Of this figure, 749 applications are pending for between 12 months and two years and 225 applications are pending in excess of two years. The remainder are less than 12 months old. It must be borne in mind that part of the delay in such cases frequently arises because of a failure on the part of the applicant to furnish in a timely manner sufficient information, or further information, to enable the application to be processed to finality.</P>
      <P>The number of persons granted and refused naturalisation in each of the last four years is as follows: in 1997, 294 persons were naturalised and 33 were refused. In 1998, 352 persons were naturalised and 32 were refused. In 1999, 416 persons were naturalised and 30 were refused while in 2000, 125 persons were naturalised and 18 were refused. To the end of September 2001, 579 persons were naturalised and 34 were refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of applications for Irish citizenship by way of post nuptial declaration currently pending is 1380. This figure can be broken down as follows: 198 applications are pending for between 12 months and two years and 136 applications are <Col N="190" /> pending in excess of two years. The number of persons granted and refused post nuptial citizenship in each of the past four years is as follows. In 1997, 984 persons were granted citizenship and ten were refused while in 1998, 1,122 persons were granted citizenship and five were refused. In 1999, 1,017 persons were granted citizenship and four were refused. In 2000, 1,018 persons were granted citizenship and four were refused. Up to the end of September 2001, 917 persons were granted citizenship and two were refused.</P>
    <P>At present, the processing time for an application for a certificate of naturalisation is approximately 18 months. The approximate processing time for an application by way of post nuptial declaration in respect of persons residing in the State is currently seven months. Applications from persons residing outside the State are lodged in an Irish Embassy or Consulate where they undergo initial processing. Their processing is finalised by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin. The applications are then forwarded to my Department for receipt of the statutory fee and the issuing of the certificate which takes, on average, two months.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question dated 5 October 2000, I outlined the measures that I proposed to implement in order to appreciably reduce the processing times in the citizenship area. These included the allocation of significant additional staff and a streamlining of the procedures employed. I am pleased to say that these measures have been effective as evidenced by the reduction in processing time in respect of applications for naturalisation from 30 to 18 months and in the case of post nuptial declarations, from 13 to seven months. I hope to be in a position to reduce this further before the year's end.</P>

      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999 and the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Act, 2000 was commenced in full on 20 November 2000. Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications/appeals for refugee status. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner &ndash; ORAC &ndash; which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal &ndash; RAT &ndash; which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, defines a refugee as &ldquo;a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any individual asylum application or on the exact nature of the country of origin information utilised by the refugee determination bodies, I can inform the Deputy that the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner investigates applications for asylum in line with the requirements of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended. Each application is considered on an individual basis having due regard to matters raised by an applicant and to such other matters as the investigator considers appropriate. A wide range of country of origin information is available to both the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in their consideration of asylum applications.</P>
    <P>With regard to the two decrees mentioned by the Deputy, as far as can be ascertained, Decree No. 2 of 1984 is no longer operative having been repealed, while Decree No. 33 of 1990 provides for measures to be taken against Nigerians convicted of drug offences overseas. Prosecution for drug trafficking is not one of the convention reasons which would bring an applicant for asylum within the definition of refugee as defined in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 125 and 930 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is responsible for considering applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is responsible for consideration of appeals. The information sought by the Deputies and covering the period 1 January 2001 to 31 August 2001, which are the most up to date statistics available, is set out in the following tabular statement. However, I can tell the Deputies that, in relation to the first nine months of this year, there were 7,569 asylum applications compared to 7,982 applications in the first nine months of 2000 &ndash; a 5.2% decrease.</P>
      <P>UNHCR statistics for the period 1 January to 31 July 2001 indicated an average 8% increase in asylum applications throughout Europe over the same period in 2000. This compared to a 6% reduction in applications received in Ireland when compared to the same period in 2000. I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner &ndash; ORAC &ndash; that, in July and August 2001 cases scheduled, processed and completed significantly exceeded intake. In July, 961 applications were received, 1,473 interviews were scheduled and 1,072 cases processed. In August, 983 applications were received, 1,543 interviews were scheduled and 1,407 cases processed. In September, 855 applications were received and 1,594 interviews scheduled.</P>
      <P>It is evident that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's strategy is starting to make a real impact on the backlog of cases on hands and will help to progressively reduce processing times on an incremental basis. By the end of this year, all outstanding cases from 1998 to the end of 2000 will have been scheduled for interview with the overwhelming majority processed to finality. Thus, from the end of this year, the ORAC will effectively be focusing mainly on applications submitted in 2001. Already some applications made in March-April 2001 have been scheduled for interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to appeals, I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal &ndash; RAT &ndash; that it expects to complete approximately 3,700 appeals in 2001. As with the ORAC, having regard to the increased processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's strategy, there has been a sig<Col N="193" /> nificant increase in the number of hearings scheduled with 3,285 hearings expected to be scheduled for 2001, to end of year, compared to 1,119 for 2000, an increase of almost 200%. There are approximately 6,500 backlog cases, that is, cases which are over six months old, on hand in ORAC and RAT as of 1 September 2001 and 3,400 of these have already been scheduled or heard. The vast majority of the balance of 3,000 cases over six months old will be scheduled by the end of year.</P>
    <P>The important achievements in the processing of asylum applications in the State which are evidenced by these statistics are the result of the successful implementation of the Government's asylum strategy. I am satisfied that the arrangements for refugee status determination currently in place provide the State with an asylum system that meets the highest international standards and which allows us to fulfil our international obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the related 1967 Protocol. I am confident that the processing arrangements which are currently in place will lead to the Government processing target of six months for applications for asylum being achieved at an early date.</P>

      <P>Section 8 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, vests in the Garda Commissioner the general direction and control of the Garda Síochána, subject to regulations. In this regard, the Commissioner has deemed it necessary to have in place provisions concerning the wearing of uniforms and the appearance of members while on duty. The purpose of these provisions is to maintain a consistent standard to be adhered to by members.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific point referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána code requires male members to be clean shaven when on duty except for moustaches. Divisional officers may allow a member working in plain clothes to wear a beard. In the case of members suffering from any medical condition, which may prevent them from being clean shaven, it is the policy of the Garda authorities to take a sympathetic approach. I am further informed that there are no plans on the part of the Garda authorities to review the code in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has the necessary human, technical, mechanical and financial resources to fight crime. Indeed, the Garda Síochána has never been as well resourced as it is today. Since I took office, the size of the force has increased from 10,800 to a current level of 11,800, an increase of over 1,000 and a record high. We are well on our way to meeting the Government commitment of 12,000 by the year 2002. The provision for the Garda Vote this year alone is £693 million, 48% higher than the 1997 allocation.</P>
      <P>It has been my policy as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the Garda has at its disposal the most modern equipment available to enable it to operate effectively in the fight against crime. This includes the provision of aircraft for use by the Garda Air Support Unit, the purchase of a patrol boat for the Garda Water Unit, the introduction of the PULSE system and the expansion of Garda CCTV systems. Work is under way on introducing a new digital based communications system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made specific reference to the question of patrol cars. It is my job to ensure that the Garda has adequate resources but the detailed deployment of those resources is a matter in the first instance for the Garda authorities. <Col N="196" /> Since I took office there has been significant investment in the Garda fleet which has expanded in size to a total of approximately 2,000 operational vehicles. Of these, 1,328 are patrol cars and allocated to divisions throughout the State. The number of vehicles allocated to each division is under constant review in order to provide a professional police service. The age profile of the fleet is 2.2 years with an average of 51,000 miles. A Garda transport advisory group has been set up to review the optimum size and structure of the Garda fleet and overall fleet replacement policy. This group includes representatives from the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>It was my honour to lead a national delegation to the World Conference Against Racism held in Durban, South Africa, from 31 August to 8 September 2001. The official delegation included not only civil servants from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, but also Deputies McGennis, Fitzgerald and Howlin, the chief executive of the Equality Authority, the chairperson of the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the chairperson of the high level steering group for the anti-racism public awareness programme, the chief superintendent of the Garda racial and intercultural office and representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade unions, YARD &ndash; Youth against Racism and Discrimination &ndash; the Irish Traveller Movement and the Association of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Michael Farrell of the Human Rights Commission also attended the conference as an observer. In addition to having an official delegation inclusive of both State and non-governmental organisations, my Department gave financial assistance to 17 representatives of other non-governmental organisations to attend the NGO forum which preceded the intergovernmental conference. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Deputies who attended and the other <Col N="197" /> members of what was a very hard-working delegation.</P>
    <P>That the conference agreed a declaration and programme of action was in itself an achievement. I remind the House that this was the first time a global conference on racism had successfully concluded. Two previous conferences, in 1978 and 1983, failed to achieve consensus. It was my intention that everything we could possibly do to ensure that the conference was a success was done. We worked with our EU colleagues under the extremely able leadership of the Belgian Presidency to agree a compromise on the Middle East brokered by the South African Foreign Minister.</P>
    <P>The issues of the historical injustices suffered as a result of slavery and colonialism and their current day legacy also required careful diplomacy but in the end a generous acknowledgement of these injustices was agreed by the conference. The conference programme of action focused around five key themes. These were: (1) sources, causes, forms and contemporary manifestations of racism; (2) victims of racism; (3) measures of prevention, education and protection aimed at eradicating racism at national, regional and international levels; (4) provision of effective remedies and other measures at national, regional and international levels; and (5) strategies to achieve full and effective equality, including international co-operation, enhancement of the United Nations and other international mechanisms to address racism.</P>
    <P>The programme of action discusses the sources and causes of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and calls for concrete action to eradicate them. A large part of the document is devoted to prevention, education and protection measures at the national level, including the concept of national and regional plans to address racism. The programme of action in effect provides a set of principles and a partial checklist of some of the key elements that need to be adopted to develop effective overall strategies to address racism.</P>
    <P>There were a number of issues included in the programme of action which are of particular interest to Ireland. These include: the concept of a national plan to be developed by states setting out how they would propose to address racism; the importance of the participation of civil society in general and the community and voluntary sector in particular in the follow up to the World Conference on Racism and in the development of national plans; the role of expert and specialised bodies and the leadership role of Governments in addressing racism; and the recognition in the programme of action that Roma, Sinti and Travellers experience racism. Of further Irish interest are the commitments in relation to migrants, asylum seekers and refugees and indigenous groups. States are urged to adopt or continue to apply all necessary measures to promote, protect and ensure the enjoyment by indigenous people of their rights; to facilitate family reunification, <Col N="198" /> where considered appropriate, which has a positive effect on integration of migrants; and to take all appropriate measures to promote the full enjoyment by all migrants of all human rights.</P>
    <P>The programme of action further urges states to prohibit racially discriminatory treatment against foreigners and migrant workers; to enact laws against trafficking in persons, especially women and children; and to compile and publish reliable statistical data to assess the situation of individuals and groups who are victims of discrimination. The document further encourages states to develop strategies to address racial discrimination against refugees and to end impunity and to prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including crimes related to sexual and other gender-based violence against women and girls. States are encouraged to develop or implement effective legislation and other measures to protect migrants, with special attention to people engaged in domestic work and trafficked persons; to ensure accountability for misconduct by law enforcement personnel motivated by racism; to eliminate racial profiling; and to protect the privacy of genetic information.</P>
    <P>The programme further urges states to implement policies and measures designed to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of religion or belief. The document further calls on states to ensure full and effective access to the justice system for all individuals. The intersection between gender and racism and multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination are also highlighted in the programme of action texts.</P>

      <P>On 1 October 2001 there were 555 prisoners remanded in custody pending further court appearances. I should point out that these figures do not include the significant number of sentenced prisoners who are also held in custody on foot of a court order pending their appearance in court at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position at present to give the exact figures for the average period for which remand prisoners are held. However, in a recent survey carried out in Cloverhill Prison, the designated committal prison for all remand prisoners in the Dublin and Leinster area, the average period was 12 weeks. It should be noted that Clo<Col N="199" /> verhill has a number of long-term remand prisoners which would distort this figure.</P>
    <P>The longest time that a prisoner, currently within the prison system, has been on remand is from 4 August 1997. His next court appearance is on 29 May 2002. This would be an extremely unusual and exceptional case and I understand that the delays which have occurred arose due to applications for adjournments on behalf of the accused.</P>
    <P>The listing of cases for trial is a matter for the courts and I have no function in this regard. However, I understand that the courts, as a general rule, give priority to cases where the accused is in custody.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 6 July 2001. The report is extensive in dealing with the review of the management of the sentences of a life sentenced prisoner who committed a murder while on temporary release from Castlerea Prison. It illustrates some weaknesses in the system and it makes recommendations to deal with them. I have asked the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service to implement all the recommendations of the report and to take whatever other steps are necessary to improve procedures and risk assessment. The Director General has assured me the Prisons Service has now introduced procedural changes to comply with the requirements of the reports recommendations.</P>
      <P>For my part, I have established a new Parole Board on an administrative basis and it is my intention to put it on a statutory basis in due course. The board will have, among other things, the task of advising me in regard to releases of the kind which is the subject of the report referred to by the Deputy. The board is representative of the general public as well as the relevant professional services which are available. Once again, I wish to express regret at the tragic consequences of the release of this prisoner and extend my sympathy to the family of the victim on the death of their mother.</P>

      <P>Road traffic legislation comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Enforcement of the legislation is a matter for the Garda Síochána. However, I assure the House that road safety is being afforded a high priority by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progressive implementation of the National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002, is being overseen by the inter-agency, high level group on road safety, which includes representatives of my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Health and Children, the National Safety Council, the Irish Insurance Federation and the National Roads Authority. In July 2001, the high level group published its third progress report on the implementation of the national strategy. This report pro<Col N="201" /> vides an account of the actions items which have, to date, been implemented by the various agencies and outlines the work that needs to be completed by 2002.</P>
    <P>I confirm that the Garda Commissioner considers the enforcement of the road traffic legislation to be an integral element of Garda policing plans, as evidenced by the continued functioning of Operation Lifesaver, which has run as a national operation since 1997. Operation Lifesaver is continuing to focus on speeding, drink driving, seat belt offences and dangerous and careless driving, which have been identified as the principal causes of road deaths and serious injury accidents. The operation involves high levels of Garda patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks, as well as media campaigns which make use of local and national radio stations and schools programmes. Thanks to this and other Garda initiatives, there has been a steady increase in the enforcement and detection of speeding, seat belt and drink driving offences. For example, in relation to speeding, the number of on-the-spot fines issued in 2000 represents a 214% increase on 1997 levels. Similarly, the number of detections for drink driving in 2000 represents an increase of 24% on 1998 levels.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that greater enforcement and targeted policing measures lead to an increase in detections, not a decrease. It would, therefore, be a gross misunderstanding to interpret recent increases in detections as a failure; rather they constitute visible signs of concerted and co-ordinated Government policy on road safety.</P>

In addition, the Government has approved the provision of assistance of up to a maximum of £162,000 in the current year to the judge for the forgotten group of victims and relatives of victims of the bombings in respect of a family support centre; approved such further assistance for the operation of the centre in 2002 as the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, may determine; and decided that support services should also be provided for victims and relatives of victims of the Dundalk bombings.</P>

      <P>In so far as the theft of arms in Athlone is concerned, I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the matter is still under investigation by the local gardaí in Athlone with the assistance of members from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. No charges have yet been preferred against any person in this matter.</P>
      <P>The theft of a large consignment of cigarettes from Belfast docks is being investigated by the RUC and there has been contact between the RUC and the Garda Síochána in relation to the investigation. While I am not sure what Deputy Bruton may have in mind when he refers to political action, he will be aware that the Government is committed to ensuring the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that for the period 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2001 the number of murders recorded where a firearm was used is seven. I am further informed that, of this total, three have been detected and four remain under investigation. I am also informed that the seven murders took place in the seven <Col N="204" /> Garda divisions of Limerick, Dublin west, Louth/Meath, Cork city, Dublin south, Laois/Offaly and Tipperary. Statistics on the number of injuries suffered as the result of shooting are not readily available and their compilation would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, murder may involve a considerable range of motivations and this makes it extremely difficult to identify clearly defined patterns to which preventative measures may be directed. However, I can inform the Deputy that, subject to a few exemptions as provided for in the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 2000, a person may not hold a firearm unless such possession is authorised by a firearm certificate granted in accordance with the provisions of the Acts. A very restrictive policy is in operation with regard to the holding of such weapons and the use of pistols, air-pistols, revolvers, handguns and stunguns is totally prohibited.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the key findings of the survey on the views of the black and ethnic minorities, published recently by the Irish section of Amnesty International. The contents of the survey and its recommendations are currently being examined by my Department. I have provided a detailed response to Amnesty Ireland's campaign on racism earlier this year in which I outlined the wide range of measures undertaken by the Government to deal with racism. Some of these measures will be reviewed with a view to adapting our responses to the complex and changing issue of racism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> Additional measures are being introduced. One of these is the three year Government funded public awareness programme to address racism and to promote an inclusive intercultural society. The official launch of the national anti-racism awareness programme has been arranged for 24 October. A high level steering group is implementing the programme in partnership with my Department. One of the first tasks of the steering group was to commission a research team to gather information that already existed on the attitudes and opinions of people in this country towards racism and minority ethnic communities. The research incorporated the conclusions of the Amnesty Ireland survey of ethnic minorities. The results of the research were completed last month and its findings are currently being examined by the steering group.</P>
    <P>The steering group also commissioned spot research on people's opinions using focus groups. That research indicated that many people had scant knowledge of ethnic minority groups in Ireland and that they were forming their views from gossip and media stories. The findings concluded that this lack of knowledge potentially created the greatest threat to increased levels of racist attitudes and the research results confirmed that many of those people interviewed acknowledged this fact.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the public awareness programme will be to increase people's knowledge of ethnic minority groups and their understanding of racism. The programme will consist of actions and initiatives in the area of media and communications, education, community and local development, Government Departments and the statutory sector, political parties and other elements, such as the workplace, policing, sport and the role of religious organisations. The programme will also provide guidelines on what each individual can do to help promote a better understanding of cultural, ethnic and religious diversity in Ireland. To this end, the steering group is preparing an information booklet for circulation to each household soon after the launch.</P>
    <P>The programme will adopt a partnership approach. The steering group is examining a number of proposals for larger partnership ventures at national level. Its first major partnership commitment will be its participation in the anti-racist workplace week which will run from 5 to 9 November 2001. The steering group has allocated £150,000 towards an advertising campaign to raise the profile of the workplace week. The steering group also launched two grant schemes as part of the programme's actions to assist community groups, including minority ethnic groups, and non-government organisations with anti-racism initiatives. Funds under the schemes will be distributed to successful applicants later this month.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I announced a review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989 in my Department. The review is being carried out in co-operation with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. It is <Col N="206" /> too early to say when the review will be concluded and what, if any, legislation will arise from it.</P>
    <P>Garda management is also studying the Amnesty Ireland survey report. Issues highlighted in the report are being addressed in current Garda training. A working definition of what constitutes a racial incident has been agreed and data capture of racially motivated crimes and offences is being developed. Gardaí are engaged in a continuing consultation process with members of ethnic minority groups and are in regular contact with community leaders. At present, there is close contact with leaders of the Muslim community in order to address their particular vulnerability at this time. Community groups are encouraged to report incidents to local gardaí and are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Garda racial and intercultural office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made a commitment in its legislative programme to publish a Disabilities Bill. This Bill will be a major positive action measure aimed at enhancing and underpinning the ability of people with disabilities to participate more fully in everyday life. Wide-ranging consultation with agencies, organisations and interest groups associated with the disability sector was undertaken in the latter part of last year in tandem with research and analysis of relevant national and international legislation. Consultation with Departments is ongoing with a view to publication of the Bill before the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>I have already stated in the House that the legislation I envisage necessitates time and thought and that any lesser effort on my part would be to short-sell people with disabilities. I have made no secret of the broad thrust of the Bill and the areas of activity being considered, including use of transport and access to public bodies and services. In view of the comprehensive consultation process that has already taken place and the fact that I indicated at its outset the broad thrust of the measures being considered, it would not be my intention to engage in any major consultations at the heads of Bill stage. Ample opportunity will be available to study the detailed provisions of the Bill on its publication and passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Disabilities Bill will be the fourth piece of major legislation relating to disability equality to <Col N="207" /> be introduced by the Government and has been progressed in the context of the legislative and infrastructural framework for equality which the Government has put in place. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, prohibit discrimination on nine specified grounds, including that of disability in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. The Equality Authority and Director of Equality Investigations, established to implement this legislation, are now fully operational. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of the National Disability Authority as a statutory agency dedicated to disability policy and practice and is also fully operational. These Acts, and the support structures that they have established, have led to tangible and widely recognised improvements for people with disabilities in the areas concerned. The Disabilities Bill will further reinforce the principles of disability equality and greatly consolidate the strides made by the Government in creating a full framework for their implementation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a final coroner's certificate is issued only when an inquest has been completed. From the relatives' perspective, there is, therefore, a practical requirement for a certificate of death to issue as soon as possible after death. In practice, coroners usually issue an interim death certificate or some written confirmation of the fact of death in advance of the inquest.</P>
      <P>Arising from the recommendations of the report of the working group on the review of the coroner service, I intend to put such interim documents on a statutory basis. The criteria for issuing these documents will be examined in detail by the proposed rules committee; this was also recommended by the working group.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 929 together.</P>
      <P>The 1997 Programme for Government included, in the context of measures to combat the drugs problem, the creation of a drug courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences.</P>
      <P>Following the report of the working group on a courts commission and also the report of the expert drug court planning committee, which I established, the pilot drug court programme was launched in the Dublin District Court on 9 January 2001 and the first sitting took place on 16 January. The court sits on Tuesday and Thursday at 3 p.m. at the Richmond courthouse and each sitting is preceded by a meeting of the drug court team and the judge. I understand that, as of 1 October 2001, 41 persons have been referred to the drug court from the Dublin District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug court pilot programme marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed to test this important alternative measure for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders. The pilot programme, which will be run for a period of 18 months, is <Col N="210" /> being evaluated by expert consultants who were appointed following a public procurement process. The success of the pilot programme depends on the development of an integrated cross service strategic plan involving court supervised treatment programmes. The merit of implementing a drug court programme outside Dublin will be considered following the completion and evaluation of the pilot project in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand and readily sympathise with the distress which families must face when a loved one goes missing and I have spoken in the House on many occasions on this subject. As I have indicated before, the deployment of Garda resources and the investigative methods used in missing persons' cases are matters for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed that the Commissioner considers that such investigations are more effective when they have the kind of local focus that is achieved under existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>These arrangements require that the Garda district officer of the area from where the person has gone missing takes direct responsibility for the investigation and employs all necessary investigative means, including, as required, the services of all specialist units. Moreover, a Garda liaison officer is appointed to liaise with one appointed family member and updates him or her on any developments that take place. In addition, an administrative and statistical function is maintained at the Missing Persons Bureau, Garda Headquarters.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána also operates a website which gives details of certain missing persons. On an international level, the Garda Síochána liaises with Interpol and relevant non-governmental organisations, where appropriate. I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána does all in its power to locate missing persons and that it provides considerable support to families. I also emphasise that all relevant Garda structures and methodologies are constantly under review, including the issue of a centralised Garda national missing persons unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding of a dedicated helpline, counselling service and other support facilities for the families of missing persons is not a function that would normally fall within my remit. However, in deference to concerns expressed on this matter, I have instructed my Department to examine the <Col N="211" /> issue and it is currently in discussions with a State-funded organisation in relation to the provision of a helpline. I also understand that health boards may be in a position to offer appropriate counselling and support services to those members of a declared missing person's family who are identified as being in need of such services. I further understand that the provision of these services is a matter, in the first instance, for each health board, having regard to the needs in individual cases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the Garda Síochána's Garda youth policy advisory group report as an important contribution to addressing the multifaceted problem of alcohol abuse among young people. The advisory group recognised that the problem relates to complex social and behavioural issues. Accordingly, the report's 15 recommendations are diverse in nature and require consideration by a range of State agencies.</P>
      <P>I confirm that with respect to the recommendations relating specifically to matters within my functional remit, namely, the proof of age scheme and the use of mobile CCTV units, my Department is actively examining the proposals. Similarly, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána is in the process of assessing the implications of the report for that organisation. I understand that the Garda authorities anticipate that the implementation of the report's recommendations will be prioritised for inclusion in the Garda policing plans for the year 2002 and beyond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137, 140, 155, 882, 956 to 958, inclusive, 961 and 962 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 92, 93 and 95 today. These questions arise in the aftermath of the evil attacks on the people of the United States. The House has already made clear its abhorrence of what occurred. I am grateful to the Deputies who tabled these questions to have the opportunity to outline subsequent developments in so far as my areas of responsibility are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The threat of major terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis <Col N="213" /> and assessment by both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. In so far as the Garda Síochána is concerned, it maintains and fosters mutual assistance and co-operation with police forces and security services worldwide to ensure an effective flow of intelligence relevant to the task. A heightened state of security awareness is in effect at vital strategic locations following on from the tragic events of 11 September. It would, however, as the Deputies will appreciate, be inappropriate to comment on the specifics of such security arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Garda, for a number of years, has maintained surveillance on a number of non-nationals whose activities were considered to warrant it. The surveillance will continue but the House will appreciate that I could not appropriately say anything further about this matter. In so far as the current worldwide investigations into the recent atrocities in the United States are concerned, the Garda is assisting in the investigations and it would not be prudent to comment on specific aspects of them at this time.</P>
    <P>The Justice and Home Affairs Council met on Thursday, 20 September 2001 to take the necessary measures to maintain the highest level of security and any other measure needed to combat terrorism. The Council decided to harness all the measures already adopted at European Union level, in particular the 1995 and 1996 conventions on extradition between the member states; the setting up of Europol and Pro-Eurojust; the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000; and the setting up of the EU Police Chiefs Task Force. Notwithstanding these measures, the seriousness of recent events has led to the speeding up of the process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice and to the stepping up of co-operation with partners, especially the United States.</P>
    <P>To this end, the Council adopted a number of measures to step up the fight against terrorism within the European Union and to improve co-operation with the United States. There are over 40 such measures and I will mention some of the principal ones: the thorough examination of two Commission proposals for Framework Decisions, one on the approximation of member states' criminal laws with a view to establishing a common definition of a terrorist act and laying down common criminal sanctions, the other on the creation of a European arrest warrant; the early ratification of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between member states of the European Union; Pro-Eurojust to bring together member states' magistrates specialising in counter-terrorism to examine the co-ordination of terrorism investigations; the Police Chiefs Task Force to discuss improved operational co-operation between member states and third countries and to co-ordinate measures implemented in member states to guarantee security, including in the field of air safety; Europol to analyse and report on the terrorist threat; the early ratification by member states of the rel<Col N="214" /> evant conventions to prevent and combat the financing of terrorism; the strengthening of border controls; and increased co-operation and closer consultations with the United States in all competent international fora and especially a more active role for the Union within the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In a separate but closely related development, the Security Council of the United Nations has adopted a wide-ranging, comprehensive resolution obliging member states to take steps and implement strategies to combat international terrorism, especially in relation to the financing or support of terrorism. Some of the measures raise difficult and complex issues and will require careful albeit urgent scrutiny. Examination of the various proposals has commenced both here at home and in the EU institutions. As regards one of the measures, the early ratification by member states of the relevant conventions to prevent and combat the financing of terrorism, the Government yesterday approved the signature by Ireland of the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. A number of the proposals will inevitably require legislation and as soon as the measures are finalised I will bring proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures arising at an international level, I am also reviewing our domestic law to see whether any changes may be necessary in the light of the events which have taken place. While the Garda Síochána has a role to play in dealing with national emergencies, the issue of facilities and equipment to cope with chemical or biological attacks is a matter for a number of agencies. At present, the issue of guidelines for emergency services in dealing with the threat of attacks using chemical or biological agents is being addressed by an interdepartmental committee under the co-ordination of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The shocking events of 11 September clearly require an urgent, comprehensive and measured response. In so far as my areas of responsibility are concerned, I hope that I have been able to demonstrate to the House that that response is well under way.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the claim made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions assistant general secretary that child care costs for working parents had more than doubled since 1998; the steps which are being taken to ensure the provision of adequate and affordable child care places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government identified child care as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. In total, <Col N="215" /> £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment. The funding is targeted at services which offer daycare facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>On 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for community based/not-for-profit child care organisations and capital grants for small scale private child care providers catering for no more than 20 children to enable us to meet these objectives. In October 2000, I was pleased to announce that that capital grants are now available to private providers who cater for more than 20 children. Grants are also available for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, child care training and innovative projects. Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, over £67 million in funding has been committed by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme with over £55 million being allocated in the form of capital or staffing grants to child care services on the ground. Almost 21,700 child care places will be supported by the funding committed by my Department which includes the creation of over 9,400 new child care places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000, my Department commissioned a study on the economics of child care in Ireland, which was conducted by Goodbody Economic Consultants. This report was published in December 1998 and contains, to date, the most up to date information available in terms of, <i>inter alia</i>, the costs of child care services. My Department has, however, recently approved funding to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to carry out research on the child care arrangements of union members. This research project is being undertaken from July 2001 to October 2001 and the report should be available before the end of 2001. The results of this survey will provide a more accurate up to date picture of the costs of child care arrangements today. The research will also provide information as to the type of child care services and facilities used by parents and the way <Col N="216" /> in which parents manage their child care needs in both formal and informal ways.</P>
    <P>As regards supports for parents, a very significant development in this regard is the improvements in the rate of child benefit. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in Budget 2001 indicated that a core objective is to provide support which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In 2001, payment rates increased by £25 per month for the first and second child to £67.50 and by £30 per month for third and subsequent children to £86 per month. Furthermore, the Minister announced that payment of these increases would be brought forward by three months to June rather than the September date which applied previously. These increases marked the first step in a three year programme which will see an additional £1 billion being invested in child related payments and will bring the child benefit rates to £117.50 and £146, respectively, by 2003, well beyond the PPF commitments. It is also worth noting that child benefit is recognised as the most effective way of combating child poverty and payments are made directly to the principal carer of the child.</P>
    <P>The measures in place by my Department, as outlined above, together with the increase in child benefit rates announced in budget 2001, reaffirm the Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

This is the first step in implementing the legislative framework recommended by the group.</P>
      <P>On the question of delays in holding inquests, the Deputy will be aware that I have no responsibility for the holding or scheduling of inquests as coroners are independent in the exercise of their quasi-judicial functions. While other factors may be involved I am confident that the proposed overhaul of coroner rules of procedure will assist in streamlining the overall process of holding inquests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to sympathise with the family of the person in question as I can readily appreciate how distressing her disappearance must be for all concerned.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person in question was reported missing in November 1999, having last been seen in Manchester on 3 November 1999. Particulars were circulated immediately by the Garda Síochána throughout the country and a full-scale investigation commenced to establish her whereabouts. The Garda Síochána, having obtained background information, made necessary inquiries at certain hospitals, night shelters and hostels. Further extensive inquires were made with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, housing sections of local authorities and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Financial institutions where the person held accounts were also checked. I also understand that liaison was maintained with the Greater Manchester Police, police at Holyhead and Interpol. I am assured by the Garda authorities that optimum use was made of all Garda resources, including its telecommunications section, missing persons website and PULSE computer system.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the case was the subject of an appeal on the RTE's &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; on 17 April 2000. Although there was an encouraging response to this appeal, all subsequent inquiries proved inconclusive. Posters of the person in question were printed by family members and displayed prominently throughout Dublin. Exhaustive inquiries have been made by the Garda Síochána at Dundrum Garda station in an effort to locate the missing person. I am assured by the Garda authorities that a Garda sergeant assigned to this investigation has maintained contact with members of the family and has apprised them of the developments. In this regard, I am informed that the most recent Garda contact with the family of the missing person occurred on 27 September 2001. Despite the extensive inquiries that have already been carried out, there has yet to be positive developments, although, of course, the Garda investigation will continue apace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that my Department, in conjunction with the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Garda Síochána, is actively considering the establishment of a national DNA database. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, such a development would have complex constitutional, legal, data protection and practical implications.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990 already provides for the taking of forensic samples from persons in custody of the kind which may be used in DNA profiling. For example, samples of hair other than pubic hair and material under a nail may be taken without the consent of a person detained in connection with a serious offence. The Act also provides for the retention of forensic samples in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The absence of a formalised national DNA database does not preclude the Garda Síochána from availing of DNA profiling in criminal investigations. The technique, as performed by the Forensic Science Laboratory, has already proven its worth by assisting in the detection of more than 500 offences, often of a very serious nature and often in circumstances where the case would not have been otherwise solved. I am convinced, however, that there remains considerable untapped potential within the criminal justice system for DNA profiling techniques and I am already initiating measures to realise this potential.</P>
      <P>For example, the proposed new Criminal Justice Bill provides for the taking, without consent, of a mouth swab from a detainee held in connection with a serious offence. This follows from the recommendation of the expert group on criminal law, appointed to consider changes to the criminal law, as recommended in the SMI report of the Garda Síochána, that saliva should be reclassified as a non-intimate sample, as an aid to DNA analysis. In the context of further enhancing the utility of DNA profiling, as I stated, my Department is actively pursuing the issue of establishing a national DNA database.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>I visited the Federal Republic of Nigeria at the invitation of the Nigerian Government on 29 and 30 August 2001. While the primary purpose of my visit was to sign, on behalf of the State, an agreement on immigration matters with the Government of the Federal Republic in Abuja on 29 August, I also had detailed discussions with the President of the Federal Republic, President Obasanjo, and with a number of Ministers in his Government on matters of mutual interest to both of our countries.</P>
      <P>I am particularly grateful to the President of the Federal Republic for meeting me and for taking the opportunity to outline, in some detail, to my delegation the significant developments which are taking place in his country in relation to the strengthening of the democratic process and democratic institutions. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Annan, has praised President Obasanjo's personal commitment to the promotion of democracy in Africa and his work to strengthen the Nigerian economy and restore integrity and leadership to his country.</P>
      <P>I also discussed with the Nigerian Government the development of trade and economic links between both our countries which, as the Deputy will be aware, have very important historical connections through the work, in particular, of Irish missionaries. This work was particularly appreciated by the Federal President who also thanked Ireland for the training provided to Nigerian medical professionals, so many of whom have gone on to make significant contributions in their own country.</P>
      <P>In relation to the contents of the agreement on immigration matters which I signed during my visit, a copy of which I intend to lay before the House shortly, I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 23 of 12 April 2001 and, in particular, 503 of 1 May 2001, in response to which I have previously outlined the main provisions of the agreement. The agreement will replace the current <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements with the Nigerian authorities for the return of their nationals who are residing illegally in the State and will provide an agreed logistical mechanism and structured framework for this purpose. In accordance with constitutional requirements, the terms of the agreement must be approved by the House for it to be binding on the State. I will table the necessary motion in the House in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with the detailed safeguards which exist in Irish law prior to a decision being taken to deport a person in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 56 and 195 of 23 May 2001. I wish to point out that the question of guarantees or concessions of the type mentioned did not arise in relation to the conclusion of the agreement. Both Governments consider that the agreement, the contents of which were negotiated in a spirit of co-operation between both sides, will make an <Col N="220" /> important contribution to tackling illegal immigration.</P>

    <P>I am also informed that the cost of the ammunition was £624,000 and that it was purchased primarily for training and operational purposes. In this regard, it is incumbent on Garda management to ensure that members who carry firearms on duty are trained to the highest level of proficiency. In order to attain and maintain this proficiency, members undergo training at regular intervals which results in the current requirement for ammunition.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that ammunition is normally issued and expended within a 12 to 15 month period. It should be noted, however, that when tendering for ammunition, the date that tenders issue seeking ammunition to the date of its actual delivery has to be considered. This can vary from 12 to 26 weeks. Therefore, ammunition ordered in one year may not be received until the following year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>A newspaper article, published on Sunday, 11 February 2001 alleged that members of the Garda Síochána and a civilian employee at Garda Headquarters had participated in trips abroad paid for by a company which supplies tyres to the Garda Síochána. On 13 February 2001, I advised the House that the Garda Commissioner had asked a chief superintendent to look at the allegations. I also advised the House that I was of the view that the matter warranted an external examination and that the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote, had instructed the internal audit unit of the Department to examine the matter.</P>
      <P>The matter subsequently became the subject of a criminal investigation and I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the chief superintendent appointed by the Garda Commissioner submitted an investigation file to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 20 April 2001 on the matters alleged. I am also informed that on 3 August 2001 the DPP sought additional information and that a further file was submitted on 13 September 2001. The directions of the DPP are currently awaited.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is carrying out a value for money examination of the purchasing of tyres by the Garda Síochána and has been in contact with officials of my Department. I understand that his work is at an advanced stage and as soon as I receive his report on this matter, I shall arrange for copies to be made available to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The investigation being carried out by the internal audit unit in the Department is continuing and certain queries have been raised with the Garda authorities in relation to this matter. When the Garda response to these queries has been received, it is hoped that the internal audit unit will be in a position to finalise its report. The Deputy may also wish to note that the processing, certification and payment of invoices from the company referred to in the question have been transferred to the finance section at Garda Headquarters. Payments for all vehicle repairs in excess of £250 are also channelled through the finance section. The Government Supplies Agency has also organised a new tender competition for supplying tyres to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>An increase in the incidence of any form of crime is a cause for concern and particularly so with respect to sex related crimes.

      <P>The resulting recommendations have implications not only for a number of areas of that system but also relate to wider social, health, education and media issues. I can confirm that I have referred the report and its recommendations to the national steering committee on violence against women, which is chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for further consideration. I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to keep the position in relation to the offences referred to by the Deputy under ongoing review.</P>

      <Quest>the total amount paid in overtime payments to staff of the prison service during 2000; the greatest amount paid to any one individual; the average payment made to staff; the steps which are being taken to control overtime costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The total figure for overtime expenditure in 2000 was £38,683,977. The largest overtime payment to any one individual was £44,485 which was paid to a prison officer in Mountjoy Prison. The average overtime per officer during 2000 was £12,336. The capacity to <Col N="223" /> earn high sums in overtime arises from the preference of local prisons management and staff to operate a voluntary overtime system. Certain staff continually make themselves available for unpopular and unsocial shifts and this is accepted as it reduces the need to compel other officers to work overtime.</P>
      <P>The prison service is continuing to monitor levels of overtime and to take corrective action where possible. The underlying problems associated with the level of additional attendance involved in the operation of the prisons do not lend themselves to short-term solutions. Staffing levels and arrangements are the product of operational circumstances which have been in place for many decades against a background, at times, of considerable tensions and difficulty. It has long been recognised that the only way to address the problem is to follow a long-term strategy which addresses the methods of deployment and conditions of service which give rise to the current high levels of overtime. This is the approach which is now being taken.</P>
      <P>Arising from a report of the prison service cost review group, a staffing and operations review &ndash; SORT &ndash; comprising senior personnel from my Department and local prisons management, was established with the following terms of reference: (a) to provide a credible record of what is actually happening in each prison having regard to the role and function of the prison regime and the constraints which exist; (b) to establish the cost in man hours of running the prison with current rosters and work/posts, while providing for non-effective time, for example, sick leave and training; and (c) to make recommendations about how arrangements can be improved and/or work reorganised to deliver an effective service. Detailed reports have been prepared in accordance with these terms of reference on all institutions within the prison system. In addition, a global report, containing recommendations applicable service wide, was published earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These reports now provide the basis for the next stage of the strategy which is the strategic effectiveness programme &ndash; STEP &ndash; which has been under way since March last. The STEP process has involved the engagement of staff interests through a change implementation team in which both management and the Prison Officers' Association are represented. The team is examining how the revised tasks identified in the SORT reports might be undertaken without the need for overtime. It is also examining the changes which would need to be made to the management and organisational structure in the prisons and conditions of service. It is intended that the STEP process will lead as soon as possible not only to more effective agreed work practices within the prison system, based on SORT recommendations, but also to a deeper emphasis on care and rehabilitation of prisoners. An enhanced training and development regime for <Col N="224" /> prison staff will also be a core element in this new dispensation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 967 together.</P>
      <P>The PULSE computer system provides the Garda Síochána with state of the art technology. The overall position is that the PULSE systems are fully operational at 181 locations which include divisional and district headquarters and all major city stations. Under this level of coverage, 85% of all incidents are directly captured and over 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to PULSE systems in their own stations. At the same time, training for the systems has been undertaken for members in other stations who also have the means to link up with the PULSE network indirectly.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that major computer systems are extremely expensive and that is why it has been decided, for the moment, to restrict the number of stations where PULSE is directly available. This is a situation that will be kept under review in the light of the availability of resources and the overall development of the systems.</P>
      <P>In relation to communications systems, the position is that Government approval has been obtained for the replacement of the existing Garda radio network with a digital trunked radio system. In that context, I signed a contract with Nokia (Ireland) Ltd for the design, supply, installation and commissioning of a pilot digital radio network in the Dublin area in July of this year. This pilot, which will last about six months, is expected to commence before the end of this year. Arrangements have been made for all the emergency services to participate in the pilot and subsequent developments. On completion of the pilot, its results will be assessed with a view to the introduction of a national digital communications system for the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system at present, including individual counselling from the Department's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service; the multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme in Cork, Arbour Hill and the Curragh; and the intensive offence focused group work programme. This has been in operation in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994 and was intro<Col N="226" /> duced in the Curragh earlier this year. The programme in Arbour Hill caters for ten prisoners at a time and the programme in the Curragh caters for eight prisoners at a time. The psychiatric service provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. Many offenders would have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to.</P>
      <P>The ultimate objective for the prisons service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions, including Ireland, that a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or, indeed, legal option in such cases.</P>
      <P>I have asked the director general of the prisons service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. A steering group to put in place multi-disciplinary prisoner programmes has been established by the director general of the prisons service. This group, chaired by a senior prison governor, comprises representatives from my Department, senior prisons service management, probation and welfare service, psychology service, prisons education and the Prison Officer's Association. Its first task will be to oversee the establishment of a new intensive rehabilitative programme for sex offenders. This programme will be delivered by a multi-disciplinary team consisting of prison officers, psychologists, probation and welfare staff and teachers. To this end the prisons service has recruited the services of a research psychologist to assist in the development of this programme. The report has been produced and is currently being examined by the steering committee. It is hoped that this report will be published by mid-November.</P>
      <P>I wish to add that a major review of the effectiveness of the intensive Arbour Hill sex offender programme is currently under way between the psychology service of my Department and the Department of Psychology, University College Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Sex Offenders Act, 2001, came into effect on 27 September 2001. One of the provisions of the Act allows the courts, in determining the sentence to be imposed on a sex offender, to consider whether to impose a sentence involving post-release supervision having regard to the need to rehabilitate or further rehabilitate the offender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 928 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the number of persons applying for permission to remain in the State on the basis of their parentage of Irish citizens. Children born in Ireland to non-Irish national parents are Irish citizens and have the same citizenship rights as other Irish citizens. No entitlement to Irish citizenship is conferred on the parents of such children but, in line with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Fajujonu case, subject to the common good, a non-Irish national who becomes the parent of an Irish citizen has a strong claim to be allowed to reside in the State with that citizen.</P>
      <P>The number of applications for permission to remain on this basis is increasing. The number of persons granted permission to remain on this basis in 1999 was 1,428, of which 1,227 were current or former asylum applicants. Some 1,515 persons were granted permission to remain on this basis during 2000 of which 909 were current or former asylum applicants. To end September 2001, permission has been granted to 2,436 persons, of whom 1,838 were current or former asylum applicants. Since the beginning of 2001, 4,397 applications of this nature have been received, of which 3,956 were from current or former asylum applicants.</P>
      <P>Figures are not readily available for the number of persons who withdraw from the asylum process when applying for or following granting of this type of permission to remain. However, based on a number of sample months during 2001, approximately 10% of persons granted permission to remain on this basis were continuing with their asylum claim at the time of their application. There is no obligation on persons to withdraw from the asylum process at the time of making an application for permission to remain as the parent of an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>Applications for permission to remain on this basis are open to abuse and a number of instances have been detected where the applicants had submitted false claims of parentage of an Irish citizen. Accordingly, all applications are examined carefully in my Department and according to particular criteria, with a view to establishing that they are genuine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations was established on 18 October 1999 on the implementation of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, to provide the main locus of redress of first instance in respect of discrimination in relation to employment, on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The remit of the office was extended to the non-employment area in October 2000 on the implementation of the Equal Status Act, 2000. The office also has limited functions in relation to gender equality cases under the Pensions Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the office, it was considered necessary to substantially increase the resources available to the redress mechanism for equality. It was decided, in consultation with the Department of Finance, that 27 posts, including five posts which transferred from the equality officer service of the Labour Relations Commission, would be adequate for the office to meet its statutory functions. Substantial financial resources have also been allocated to the office <Col N="230" /> to enable it to discharge its statutory functions. The financial allocation for the office in 2001 is £1.335 million, comprising £930,000 in respect of pay and £405,000 for non-pay purposes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to the large increase in referrals to the office in 2001 over 2000. It was anticipated that there would be an increase in the amount of cases referred as the new equality legislation becomes established. The total number of employment equality cases received by the office and equality officer service of the Labour Relations Commission &ndash; LRC &ndash; in 1999 was 59 and by the LRC in 1998 was 85. In 2000, the first full year of operation of the office, it received 139 cases under employment equality legislation and eight under the Equal Status Act, 2000. The office received 192 cases under employment equality legislation in the period January to August 2001 and 515 cases under the Equal Status Act in the same period.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the office was in a position to deal with the anticipated increase in cases, the additional posts to deal with the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act respectively were sanctioned on implementation of the relevant legislation rather than on a phased basis in accordance with the increased case load under the legislation. This enabled the office to devote considerable resources to training for members of staff in order to ensure that they are in a position to deal with the increasing number of cases being referred to the office and to provide a quality service to their customers. In 2000 a total of 550 days were spent in training. Direct training expenditure alone amounted to £34,000 which represents 6% of direct payroll costs.</P>
    <P>The resources allocated to the office took into account the likelihood of a strong interest in the new grounds in the initial years of the office's operation. I do not plan, therefore, to increase the resources of the office in relation to its existing statutory functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 907 and 908 together.</P>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated and which came into effect on 6 July 2000, represents a considerable strengthening of the law on underage drinking. It increased fines for breaches of the law on underage drinking, abolished the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in any proceedings against the licensee and made provision for a new penalty &ndash; a temporary closure order &ndash; on conviction of the sale of alcohol to underage persons. The temporary closure provision is intended to be a strong deterrent to abuses of the law in this area.</P>
      <P>The removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence requires the licensee to ensure that intoxicating liquor is supplied only to those who are legally entitled to purchase or consume it on licensed premises. This places a much greater onus on the licensee to demand proof of age. The national voluntary age card scheme, which I introduced by way of regulations in April 1999, is designed to assist licensees in complying with the law. The scheme is intended for persons who have already attained 18 years of age and who are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises and who wish to do so. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists. In this way, the scheme can assist both consumers and licensees. In any proceedings against a licensee for the sale of alcohol to an underage person, it is a defence to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced. Where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to such a person is upheld, a licensed premises will be the subject of a mandatory temporary closure order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Age cards are issued by the Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2. The application procedure is relatively straightforward and I am happy to say that, to date, over 40,700 cards have been issued. These cards have security features, which include a hologram, incorporated into their design and I am not aware of any widespread or systematic forgery of the age cards. I have been informed by the Garda of a small number of individual cases where cards <Col N="232" /> were forged or interfered with and these are under investigation.</P>
    <P>The 1999 regulations do not preclude the use of a passport for proof of age purposes. For many young visitors to our country it may be the only form of proof of age available to them. However, I encourage use of the age card wherever possible since a passport is a document primarily intended for another purpose. The current age card scheme, coupled with the substantial changes provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, is proving an effective deterrent against underage drinking. However, I am keeping the scheme under continual review and in that context I have recently established a review group within my Department which, in consultation with the Garda, will examine operation of the scheme with a view to identifying any defects coming to light and, if necessary, make appropriate recommendations. I expect that this group will report to me by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>There are two principal causes of legal actions against the State by members and former members of the Garda Síochána. The first is where an injury is inflicted maliciously on them in the course of or in relation to the performance by them of their duties as members of the Garda Síochána. Applications for compensation in respect of malicious injuries are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts, 1941 and 1945, which provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that awards of compensation can only be made by a judge of the High Court. There are approximately 1,750 such claims on hand at present.</P>
      <P>The second instance relates to ordinary injuries received while on duty. In respect of such legal actions there are approximately 160 claims on hand. In all such cases the amount sought is not indicated by the plaintiff and the level of compensation only becomes apparent following either settlement talks between the parties concerned or following the hearing of a case in the relevant court.</P>

      <P>The statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 139 states have signed the statute and, of these, 37 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>Following the successful outcome of the constitutional referendum on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court it will be necessary for my Department to bring forward implementing legislation to give effect to the terms of the Rome Statute in Irish law. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is a very complex instrument that requires detailed consideration to establish exactly what will be required by way of amending legislation to enable us to ratify the statute. The legislation required to give effect in Irish law to the statute will be very substantial considering the complex issues that arise to be dealt with. By way of illustration, for example, the New Zealand Act giving effect to the statute consists of 187 sections and one schedule while the UK legislation consists of 84 sections and ten schedules.</P>
      <P>A careful and detailed examination of the statute is taking place in my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office, to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be taken so that we will be in a position to meet our obligations under the statute. I am happy to inform the House that substantial progress is being made in this regard.</P>
      <P>At an international level, the Rome Statute is being discussed in a number of fora, for example, the Council of Europe, with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner and we are taking an active part in those discussions. The legislative changes needed to give effect to the statute in Irish law, following completion of this examination, will be brought forward as soon as possible. I assure the Deputy that the legislation will be introduced as quickly as possible having regard to other high priority legislative requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Registry has been in the process of implementing computerised systems to manage its records base for several years. This task commenced in the <Col N="234" /> early 1980s with the computerisation of the folios &ndash; the main records of ownership &ndash; for land in Dublin and this programme was later extended to the new folio records created for land in Counties Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Roscommon. Throughout the 1990s continual innovations and improvements were introduced including computerised application tracking systems for all counties.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, a major advance was made with the introduction of an integrated title registration information system &ndash; ITRIS. This system, which is designed to electronically store and manage information in relation to title registration, is being rolled out on a gradual basis across the organisation. ITRIS is currently available in nine counties serving over 60% of the applications lodged in the Land Registry. It will be extended to County Waterford in late October 2001, to Counties Kerry and Limerick during January 2002 and it is planned to have it operational in all counties by the end of 2002. A key element of this new system is electronic access service &ndash; EAS. This enables customers of the Land Registry, who subscribe to the service, to conduct on-line searches of folios and name index records through the Internet where the folios are held in electronic format and to order copies of certain documents electronically.</P>
      <P>The EAS is one of the flagship initiatives undertaken under the Information Society Action Plan and Electronic Government programme. The Land Registry was the first Government Department or office to go live with such a system. The EAS is already operating very successfully and over 2,500 customer accounts are currently in operation. A measure of its success is that almost 1,000 business transactions each day are being electronically undertaken by customers of the service.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry has been in operation since 1892 and manages a vast resource of records and ownership documents. At present, approximately 400,000 folios, or less than 25% of the total, are in electronic format with the balance held as paper documents. The Land Registry is currently implementing a strategy to systematically convert these into computerised formats and a major project will commence shortly to capture the remaining paper folios and their associated &ldquo;filed plan&rdquo; maps. When this project, which will be undertaken on a county by county basis over a three year period, is complete, all folios and file plan maps held by the Land Registry &ndash; estimated at over 6.4 million images &ndash; will be available to customers in electronic format, both directly from Land Registry offices and over the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Registry has also looked at the business case for introducing &ldquo;digital mapping&rdquo; or, as it is sometimes called Geographic Information Systems &ndash; GIS &ndash; technology as a means of managing its map base. The Land Registry appreciates the important role which spatial and geo-referenced data and digital mapping technology in <Col N="235" /> general can play in the context of delivering services to customers. The registry is continuing to keep these matters under review and intends playing an active role in any central initiative to promote and develop the use of such information arising from the work of the Information Society forum.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that in the Registry of Deeds, a computerised system of recording details of registrations has been in place since 1990 and the resulting database has been added to considerably since its introduction. Today, all searching of ownership records in the Registry of Deeds covering the period from 1970 to date, is done electronically.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 1995 the Government endorsed proposals from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for administering, supervising and monitoring the non-national road restoration programme subject to &ldquo;an independently validated efficiency audit to be undertaken of all aspects of county councils&rdquo; operations in the roads area with a view to increasing efficiency.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach provided the secretariat for a cross-departmental review group of the efficiency of county councils' operations in the non-national roads area. The review was one of a number of similar evaluations of areas of major public expenditure, for example, Navy and Air Corps, Garda Síochána which were undertaken around that time under the banner of the Strategic Management Initiative. A consortium of consultants led by KPMG was awarded the contract in May 1997 for professional services in relation to the review. The review was completed in December 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the recommendations is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and <Col N="240" /> Local Government who, I understand, established a working group made up of senior administrative and technical officers from his Department and from local authorities. I understand this group has overseen action in a number of areas including production of best practice documents and development of training programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparations for the introduction of the euro in the Department of the Taoiseach are well advanced. The Department's euro changeover plan was prepared in March 2000 and has been revised on a number of occasions. The plan identifies changeover tasks and the divisions which are responsible for those tasks on a quarterly basis with effect from 1 January 2000. The Department's finance office reports on a quarterly basis to the Management Advisory Committee on progress made in the changeover to the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is represented by the finance officer on the single currency officers' team, commonly known as SCOT, which oversees the euro changeover in the public service. The finance unit provides regular updates of development at SCOT to the associated bodies. A euro changeover group, representing all divisions within the Department, meets regularly to ensure that progress is made in implementing the Department's euro changeover plan. The Department and associated bodies are relatively small in overall public service terms. However, there is still a range of important issues that must be considered, as follows: money flows &ndash; inwards and outwards: with very few exceptions, inward money flows are processed through the Department's finance unit. The amounts involved are relatively small. All money flows outwards are processed through the finance unit. The Department administers grant-in-aid to the NESC and NESF, respectively. These bodies have prepared their own changeover plans in consultation with the Department. The newly established National Centre for Partnership and Performance is currently preparing a changeover plan. Cash handling: the only cash handling relates to a small amount of petty cash, which is managed by the finance unit. Information technology: the conversion of IT systems represents the main challenge. The Department operates the following categories of IT system: financial management system, FMS. This is the core financial system in use by the Department. The Department has elected to convert static data, historic data will not be converted. The year end procedure in the finance unit will involve the closure of the Irish punt database and the conversion and transfer of balances to a new euro FMS database. Testing of the conversion procedure commenced in mid July and it is expected that it will be finalised by mid-October. Office automation software and IT infrastructure: the majority of personal computers have had euro patches installed. Servers and personal computers are being upgraded to <Col N="242" /> Windows 2000 during October/November and as part of this process all personal computers will be revisited to ensure that they are euro compliant. An audit of non-IT office equipment has identified one item of equipment which will require upgrading to ensure euro compliance. Suppliers and Customers: the Department has received replies from 21 key suppliers confirming that they have euro changeover plans in place. Staff education and training: briefings for staff will be held during the remainder of 2001 on the introduction of the euro. Staff payroll and pensions: the Department's payroll service is provided by the Department of Finance, which uses the Core pay system. Associated bodies and offices: the finance unit maintains regular contact with the bodies under the Department's aegis. The last meeting was held on 25 September 2001. The planning for the euro is proceeding satisfactorily. The National Centre for Partnership and Performance is currently preparing a euro changeover plan.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to arrange that, except where the context clearly requires otherwise, between now and 1 January 2002, and for a reasonable period thereafter, all monetary values in replies to parliamentary questions will be shown in euro and Irish pounds.</P>

      <P>On 27 March 2001 the Government decided to postpone the Census of Population scheduled for Sunday, 29 April 2001 until Sunday, 28 April 2002. The decision was taken following the advice of the expert group on foot and mouth disease and after consultation with the Central Statistics Office and Departments. The following are the main reasons it was decided to postpone the taking of the census for a full year: it was not clear at the outset whether the FMD situation would have improved sufficiently in the shorter term to allow the census field work to go ahead; a date other than April would be out of phase with the long standing practice of staging censuses in the month of April thereby giving rise to inconsistencies in comparing demographic trends over time and the logistical problems of re-printing all materials, including census forms, and of reorganising the field force in a shorter period would be enormous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The case under reference was the subject of a determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in July 2000 (Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991) and a Rights Commissioner's decision in May 2000 (Payment of Wages Act, 1991).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991, an employer must carry out a decision of the tribunal within six weeks, unless the decision is under appeal to the High Court on a question of law. If an employer fails to implement such a decision, the employee's trade union or the Minister may institute proceedings on behalf of the employee seeking payment of the award made by the tri<Col N="244" /> bunal. As regards this case no approach has been made to my Department. Enforcement of awards of this nature may be pursued through the employment rights section of my Department. In such cases my Department refers the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal advice as to the enforceability of the decision, and, if so enforceable, for its consideration as to the appropriate legal steps to take to enforce the award. I understand that the employer is resident outside of the Irish jurisdiction and in these circumstances it may prove very difficult to enforce the particular award. However, further clarification on the matter may be obtained from the enforcement and prosecution unit of my Department, at (01) 6313019 or on Lo-call 1890 220222.</P>
    <P>The Payment of Wages Act, 1991, provides that a decision of a rights commissioner may be enforced as if it were an order of the Circuit Court made in civil proceedings by the judge of the Circuit Court where the person, in whose favour the rights commissioner made the decision, resides.</P>

      <P>The schedule attached to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 92 of Tuesday, 26 June 2001, Ref. 19092/01, <Col N="245" /> which concerned details of consultancy work carried out on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, included the cost of legal fees incurred by the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Competition Authority. These are, respectively, independent statutory officers and a statutory body and obtain legal advice and representation independent of the State. The schedule also included details of legal costs association with investigations and prosecutions being carried out under the Companies Act, for example, the cost of representation in the Cayman Islands. There was also a cost associated with a barrister employed to assist in the drafting of consolidation of company law. The nature of these legal costs, as indicated, means that the question of possible lack of consistency in advice provided to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not arise.</P>

      <P>I have received representations concerning the takeover of the company referred to. These representations have referred in particular to the decline in the value of the company's share price and a belief that it was improper for the chief executive to seek to take over the company at its reduced valuation.</P>
      <P>I have received no information relating to this transaction to indicate that there has been any malpractice or that the company or its directors have failed to carry out their statutory duties under the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>The decline in the company's share price does not of itself suggest or prove malpractice. A significant decline in share price has happened in many other cases. The recent sharp decline in the value of many technology stocks is just one such example.</P>
      <P>The fact that the company's chief executive is seeking to takeover the company equally does not of itself suggest wrongdoing. Management buyouts, MBOs are a quite common feature of commercial enterprise.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of the company did not require regulatory clearance by me under the mergers legislation as the relevant financial thresholds were not met.</P>

Individuals from visa required countries, such as Mongolia, are normally required to leave the State in order to change their status &ndash; in the case in question as a visitor &ndash; so as to allow them to work.

      <P>I have been concerned about the implications for Irish policyholders affected by the liquidation of Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, a UK authorised insurer, since June last. Since IICL was a UK authorised insurer, responsibility for the financial supervision of the company's operations in the European economic area lies with the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>Individuals who, while in the employment of a company whose cover was with IICL, suffered injury through an accident at work, would have a claim against that company and in normal circumstances, that claim would be paid by IICL. Given the situation that now exists, insurance claims against businesses, whose cover was with IICL, will be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the &ldquo;home&rdquo; member state &ndash; in this case, the UK. UK insolvency law treats all policyholders as unsecured creditors. The extent to which the liquidators will be able to meet claims from creditors of IICL, including business policyholders, is not yet fully clear. We are constantly monitoring this situation.</P>

      <P>I have been concerned about the implications for Irish policyholders affected by the liquidation of Independent Insurance company Limited, IICL, a UK authorised insurer, since June last. Following the commencement of the liquidation process in the UK, I immediately met with representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation to address the urgent consequences for the company's Irish policyholders. I know that the insurance industry here provided alternative cover within a short timescale for most of the policyholders affected. Irish companies are at the liberty to seek insurance on the London market or elsewhere in the EU. I would point out that the insurance cover is provided through the marketplace by individual private insurance companies, that offer cover on the basis of their assessment of the risk.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on community employment, CE, are being mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for these services.</P>
      <P>The mainstreaming of schools services is currently under way and after an appropriate transition period to allow participants work out their contracts in schools, such services will be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. Arising from these changes, an additional £46 million is to be made directly available to schools on an annual basis, phased in by 2003, for the purposes of providing replacement services in schools. Following the completion of transfer of funding to schools, there will be no further CE involvement in that area.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Department of Health and Children on the mainstreaming of CE health services are proceeding and I look forward to early progress. An appropriate level of funding equal to CE spending on health services would then transfer to the Department of Health and Children to place such services on a more secure footing. Discussions with the Department of Environment and Local Government have also been commenced recently by my Department on the possibility of mainstreaming certain environmental services currently provided under CE to that Department. These discussions will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to process applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. The processing time for work permit applications has risen this year due to the unprecedented number of applications that continue to be received in the Department. The number of applications has increased from an average of 350 applications per week last year to over 1,000 per week. Increases in staff resources and overtime have facilitated the issue of over 26,800 work permits in the first eight months of this year compared to 18,000 for the full year in 2000. The Department is continuing to examine options for significantly reducing the processing time for the issue of work permits.</P>
      <P>With reference to the list of applications, details supplied, in respect of various employers received by the work permits section in the Department, I am informed that some of these permits were issued last month. Assuming that the remaining applications are completed correctly and are otherwise in order, they should take approximately eight weeks to process from date of receipt.</P>

    <P>Subsequently my Department was informed by the Chief State Solicitor's office to the effect that the matter cannot be pursued further because the employer appears to have ceased trading and has no assets against which a judgment may be enforced. As the particular company was dissolved in August 2000, it no longer constitutes a legal entity and in such a state cannot be made the subject of further legal proceedings.</P>

These arrangements include a detailed changeover plan in place, covering all aspects of our Department's activities, a designated assistant secretary to oversee implementation of the plan, monthly meetings of the departmental euro changeover croup, chaired by the designated assistant secretary and involving all sections of our Department that have euro related activity and which provide for detailed monitoring of our Department's changeover plan, monthly meetings of the euro changeover group, consisting of representatives of the various State agencies under this Department, where the issues on the changeover plan are updated, ongoing <Col N="252" /> training of staff at individual section level, together with attendance of staff at Central Bank training courses on security features of euro notes, preparation of monthly progress reports on implementation of changeover plans to ECBI and participation in the monthly meetings of the single currency officers team, SCOT, in the ECBI.</P>
      <P>In addition our Department has specific responsibility for providing information to assist all businesses, including SMEs, with their preparations for the euro currency. The EMU business awareness campaign, which is managed by Forfás on behalf of our Department, has undertaken this task since its launch in 1996. Features of the campaign to date include a comprehensive information pack and euro seminars and workshops throughout the country. Forfás also produced a retail training kit which has been widely distributed to retailers.</P>
      <P>The Office of Director of Consumer Affairs has prepared a national code on euro changeover. Subscribers to this code, which is a code of practice on dual pricing, will be entitled to display a special logo as evidence of their commitment, to implement the changeover fairly. By subscribing to the national code, businesses commit themselves to seek no advantage from the changeover and to assist the consumer through such means as dual pricing and both in-store display and six digit conversion rate display.</P>
      <P>In relation to replies to future parliamentary questions, I have asked our Department to arrange that, except where the context clearly requires otherwise, between now and 1 January 2002 and for a reasonable period thereafter all monetary values in replies to parliamentary questions will be shown in both euro and Irish pounds. In view of the above, we are satisfied that our Department has made adequate arrangements for the smooth changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002.</P>

      <P>All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are over 140 ship registers in operation worldwide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state. I am advised that the practice of using flags of convenience, involving what is perceived as lenient regulatory requirements, is still permissible under international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the Marine Survey Office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port state control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, and, in relation to seafarers' social conditions, by the International Labour Organisation's, ILO, maritime conventions, together with relevant EU initiatives in the maritime area. Deficiencies identified are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration and may have to be rectified before the ship continues its journey. Ireland participates in IMO and ILO discussions on seafarers' welfare, supporting proposals aimed at improving their terms and conditions of employment. EU initiatives in relation to seafarers' hours of work will be introduced shortly. My officials are actively supporting initiatives in the Community to develop an EU maritime social <Col N="255" /> policy and in that context the Deputy's concerns will be addressed.</P>

The director of the coastguard is constantly assessing the case based on risk assessment by location for improving resources. The director is also undertaking a major programme of re-equipment and refurbishment of facilities available to coastguard volunteers. Where it is clear that the provision of new facilities and the re-equipment and upgrading of existing facilities will add to our capacity to save lives at sea, this will be provided subject to available resources. Having regard to the above, it is the coastguard's intention to provide a quad for the Tramore unit before the end of the year.</P>

Funding of £125,000 was provided last year for the county council to support essential safety and maintenance works.</P>
      <P>The scope for funding a development of the extent envisaged for Clogherhead is being kept under review by my Department in consultation with Louth County Council in the context of funding available under the fisheries harbours capital programme and overall national priorities. Any major capital investment would require in the first instance comprehensive cost benefit analysis having regard to all relevant economic and socio-economic factors, trends in volume and value of landings, the extent to which displacement is a factor, fleet trends and regional and local considerations. Reported fish landings at Clogherhead for 2000 show that 1,083 tonnes, live weight, were landed at Clogherhead with a value of £1.9 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall national responsibility for marine emergency management has been assigned to the director, Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, in accordance with section 4(1)(<i>c</i>), section 4(1)(i) and section 9 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. This includes the following: (1) search and rescue services for persons in dis<Col N="258" /> tress within the Irish marine search and rescue region, IMSRR, inland rivers, lakes and waterways, the littoral area and cliffs of Ireland and offshore islands; (2) response to pollution reports and incidents within the Irish marine pollution responsibility zone, IMPRZ, and coastline; (3) response to casualty or salvage situations required by the Salvage and Wreck Act, 1993; (4) a national marine broadcasting network for marine information, weather and radio navigation warning broadcast service for shipping and other sea and coastline users and marine public telephone and correspondence service; and (5) marine safety awareness within the Department's marine safety initiative.</P>
      <P>The coastguard has 65 full-time staff and approximately 700 volunteers. It manages and operates three co-ordination/communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 16 remote VHF sites and 52 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage. Its engineering stores are located in Cork and Dublin. The 52 coastguard units are operated by a total of 700 volunteers and are located on all coasts. The coastguard has two medium lift marine emergency helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the other in Dublin Airport. These all weather helicopters are available on a 24 hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline.</P>
      <P>In addition to its own resources, the coastguard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round. These include two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner and Waterford, the RNLI which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast and nine community inshore rescue service boats based in strategic locations. It can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda and its divers and the UK coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation. In addition, many local volunteer groups, such as sub-aqua clubs, assist in searches. I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work done by all those involved.</P>
      <P>As regards the provision of boats for the coastguard and the allocation of those boats to various locations, the availability of other rescue boats in the areas is a major consideration and must be borne in mind so as to ensure that our resources are used in the most efficient and effective way. As regards the provision of a boat in the Achill, Killala and Ballyglass areas of County Mayo, there are two RNLI all weather boats, one in Achill and one in Ballyglass. There is also a coastguard D class boat in Killala. The coastguard had a boat in Achill to assist with shoreline searching, but as the unit had no station house, the condition of the boat deteriorated and had to be withdrawn. We are currently in discussion with Mayo County Council about sharing a building with the fire brigade on Achill and it is intended to reposition a boat with the coastguard unit then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of funding which was made avail<Col N="259" /> able from my Department to the vote of the Irish Coastguard in the last three years is as follows: 1999 &ndash; £11.3 million, 2000 &ndash; £11.6 million and 2001 &ndash; £12.6 million. The Irish Coastguard does not receive any EU funding for its activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The national salmon stocks remain vulnerable and for this reason I endorse any initiative which assists in an increased escapement of salmon to spawn. I have made it clear that I want the salmon fishing sector to have a viable future, but this future critically depends on effective restoration and conservation of the salmon resource. Important measures are currently in place aimed at conserving and enhancing these stocks and I am currently reviewing these in the light of the experience of the season now coming to a close.</P>
      <P>It is important that all sectors share in the burden of reducing salmon catches. In July last, on the advice of the National Salmon Commission, I banned the sale of rod caught fish from 1 August 2001 and I asked the commission to advise me on further measures to reduce the rod catch. I also indicated that I would consider the position of the commercial salmon fishing sector in the context of the results of the salmon tagging programme, which I introduced on 1 January last, before considering what additional measures may be necessary to reduce the catch further in 2002. The compilation and analysis of this year's tagging returns are in progress and I expect to receive these in a few weeks' time. Salmon is not a regulated species under the CFP framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months I have met with a number of individuals and groups to hear their views on the buy-out of driftnet salmon licences. The objective of buy-outs is to ensure that more salmon enter our rivers in order to spawn, thus underpinning the sustainable development of the species. It is not necessarily the case that a buy-out of any individual commercial fishermen will result in an overall reduction of the levels of exploitation by the sector. It is not clear that a national buy-out <Col N="260" /> scheme is a cost efficient workable solution that delivers real results. International experience is at best mixed and I remain unconvinced that a national buy-out scheme is the best answer at this point in time. However, I am prepared to consider the issue further in the context of the outcome of the 2001 tagging scheme and of the range of options for incentivising reductions in the commercial catch, including a set aside scheme.</P>

      <P>The data deriving from the operation of the tagging scheme in year one will not be available until all returns for 2001 are made in accordance with the tagging regulations. The data collection is currently under way and the Central Fisheries Board has informed me that it will take a number of weeks after the end of the angling season to complete the collation and analysis of the data. The salmon season ended on 30 September and the sea trout season ends on 12 October. The Central Fisheries Board advises that compliance with the scheme during the commercial and angling seasons has been generally satisfactory. Amendments are under consideration to the log book content for next season with a view to reducing the amount of information to be completed by both anglers and distributors. The National Salmon Commission will continue to consider and advise me on the operation of the tagging scheme generally.</P>

      <P>Teelin Pier is owned by Donegal County Council and responsibility for its repair and maintenance rests with the local authority in the first instance. My Department has not, to date, received any proposals from Donegal County Council in relation to this pier. Any proposals which the local authority wishes to put forward will receive careful consideration, having regard to the overall development needs of fishery harbours generally and the funding available for such works.</P>

      <P>My Department's euro changeover plan, which was drawn up last year, sets out comprehensive arrangements and actions to ensure a successful changeover to the euro. The imple<Col N="264" /> mentation of that plan is monitored by the Department's euro changeover group, chaired by an assistant secretary, while a euro working group representative of all areas of the Department has responsibility for dealing with day to day issues associated with the changeover. In addition, my Department has appointed a euro changeover officer who co-ordinates action internally and liaises with both the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and the Department's agencies.</P>
      <P>The euro changeover plan addresses a number of requirements with a view to effecting a successful changeover to the euro, including staff training and awareness, euro compliance of financial management systems, payroll systems, euro compliance of IT systems, client awareness, adaptation of standard forms and leaflets for the public and changeover arrangements within organisations under the aegis of the Department. Progress in all of these matters is on target at present. As regards money values in replies to parliamentary questions, I have asked my Department to arrange that, except where the context clearly requires otherwise, between now and 1 January 2002 and for a reasonable time thereafter money values will be shown in both euro and Irish pounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced by me on 25 June 2001 the company concerned &ndash; Arramara Teoranta, the national seaweed company in which the State is the majority shareholder &ndash; has had to be restructured in the face of trading difficulties. This restructuring has involved the cessation of production at Arramara's Donegal plant and the relocation of all operations to the company's main plant in County Galway. In the short-term, arrangements have been made for an amount of Donegal harvested seaweed to be used in the <Col N="265" /> Galway plant but it must be appreciated that this imposes an additional strain on the company's already precarious finances having regard to the substantial transport costs involved which are being met in full by Arramara.</P>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, there are proposals being developed by third parties which are aimed at the continuation of seaweed development and production in Donegal and I hope that these can be brought to a conclusion shortly.</P>

      <P>As explained in previous answers, funding of £600,000 was approved in principle for this project by the Minister for Finance, subject to submission by the promoters, the Arigna Energy Valley Limited, AEVC, of business plans showing the viability of the project.</P>
      <P>I commissioned a consultant to produce a due diligence report on the project and I discussed that report with the AEVC in April last. The consultant and the AEVC were at variance on financial aspects of the project and I requested the AEVC to review the situation in discussion with the consultant. It did not prove possible to arrange a meeting between the parties until July due to the unavailability of members of the AEVC. Following submission of additional information by the AEVC, a final draft consultant's report was presented to my Department in late August. A copy of that report was sent to the AEVC for comment on 13 September. I await its response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meeting of the European Council in Gothenburg in June all the member states of the European Union, including Ireland, reconfirmed their commitment to enlargement. It was also indicated that the ratification process for the Treaty of Nice will continue so that the Union is in a position to welcome new member states from the end of 2002. It is the shared view of the member states, including Ireland, that the entry into force of the Treaty, which requires ratification by each member state in accordance with its own parliamentary or constitutional requirements, is necessary for enlargement. It is also the case that Ireland's position ultimately remains a matter for the Irish people to determine.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have made clear to our European partners, to the candidate countries and to this House that the Government is determined to find a way forward which will allow enlargement to proceed as envisaged. As we have stated, this requires careful and comprehensive reflection on the outcome of the Nice Treaty referendum and on the various issues raised during the referendum campaign. One important element in this process of reflection will be the work of the National Forum on Europe, which it is hoped to establish shortly. While in the Government's view it would be premature to come to firm conclusions on how exactly to proceed, we are well aware of the timeframe within which decisions will require to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217, 218, 219 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Middle East remains a matter of grave concern and an issue of high priority on the international agenda. I had the opportunity to visit Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian territories in mid September and to meet with key players. My discussions with President Mubarak and Foreign Minister Maher of Egypt, with President Katzev and Foreign Minister Peres of Israel and with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat revealed a depth of concern on all sides about the direction of the peace process. I took the opportunity of this visit to express once again the consistent Irish view, which is shared by our European Union partners, that the only hope for peace in the region is a cessation of acts of violence on both sides and an early resumption of dialogue with a view to implementing the proposals in the Mitchell Report immediately and without preconditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told Foreign Minister Peres and Israeli President Katzev that the lifting of closures on Palestinian areas, the release of funds owed to the Palestinian Authority by Israel and an end to settlement activity are all essential elements in any move towards dialogue. I spoke to Foreign Minister Peres by telephone on 24 September and reiterated the Government's desire to see a <Col N="268" /> resumption of dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Ireland has made these points on numerous occasions, both in public statements and at the Security Council. The European Union has also raised these issues repeatedly, both in declarations and in face to face meetings with the various political leaders in the Middle East. As I emphasised in a public statement on 1 August this year, extra-judicial killings are contrary to international law. This view was also expressed by the General Affairs Council of the European Union in the conclusions of its July meeting and would certainly apply to the specific case mentioned.</P>
    <P>The closures and restrictions imposed on the Palestinian population clearly cause considerable suffering and will be among the issues raised at the meeting of the parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which is expected to take place within the next few weeks. I could not agree that the State of Israel is at war with the Palestinian Authority. In spite of the gravity of the situation, there are indications that both sides appreciate the weight of the issues at stake. The peace message addressed to the Israelis by President Arafat was a statesmanly gesture and the Israeli response in suspending offensive military actions against Palestinians was positive. There has been a significant decrease in the level of violence. Nevertheless, it is highly regrettable that violence continues at a substantial level. The most recent setback, the terrorist attack carried out on 2 October by Hamas against Israeli settlers, in defiance of President Arafat's explicit orders to cease such actions, is to be condemned. At the same time, I strongly urge Israel not to allow itself to be provoked into any excessive reaction which would wreck the cease-fire.</P>
    <P>The meeting between President Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres in Gaza on 26 September was a welcome development and agreed a series of practical, concrete steps which it is vital that both sides fully implement. In my discussions with US Secretary of State Powell on 26 September I stressed the importance of this engagement of the two sides. The Secretary of State briefed me on the active efforts of the US Administration to encourage the commencement of negotiations between the parties. Hopefully, the Arafat-Peres meeting was the first in a fruitful process of dialogue.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the constant support of the United States, the European Union, Russia, Egypt, Jordan and other international actors will be essential if progress is to be made. Ireland is prepared to play its part in providing such support. As I have said in this House before, the objective for both parties must be the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace, which must necessarily recognise the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's right to live in peace and security. Ireland and the European Union are in regular contact with all the parties concerned and will continue to press these views.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government condemns the atrocities committed by the regime in Guatemala during the 36 year armed conflict which ended in 1996 and supports bringing to trial those responsible including a person (details supplied).</Quest>
      <QRef>[21235/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The atrocities committed during more than three decades of violent conflict in Guatemala were documented in detail in the February 1999 Report of the Commission for Historical Clarification, CEH, following its Spanish initials. The mandate of the CEH derived from the Oslo Peace Accord of 23 June 1994, which came into force with the signature of the final, umbrella &ldquo;Agreement on a Lasting Peace&rdquo; in Guatemala City on 29 December 1996.</P>
      <P>The CEH found that 93% of its documented acts of violence and violations of human rights, including genocide against the Mayan people, were attributable to the state. Acts of violence attributable to the guerrillas represented 3% of the violations registered by the CEH. The report comments: &ldquo;This quantitative difference provides new evidence of the magnitude of the State's repressive response. However, in the opinion of the CEH, this disparity does not lessen the gravity of the unjustifiable offences committed by the guerrillas against human rights.&rdquo;  The CEH found that 4% of the violations were committed by other actors such as &ldquo;private individuals in defence of their own interests . . . the perpetrators were economically powerful people at the national or local level&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since the conclusion of the Peace Accords and the publication of the CEH Report, Ireland and its EU partners have been concerned to see their full implementation, including the ending of the culture of impunity from prosecution of those accused of human rights violations of all kinds. It was in this spirit that on 25 April 2001, the eve of the third anniversary of the murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi, a leading defender of human rights, the EU issued the following declaration:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union respectfully honours the memory of Monsignor Gerardi today, three years after his brutal murder, and welcomes the recent opening of his murder trial. The European Union has noted with approval President Alfonso Portillos's repeatedly expressed determination to see Bishop Gerardi's murder solved. It sympathises with and supports the judges, judicial authorities, members of the legal profession and other actors involved throughout the difficulties of this entire process of investigation and trial, particularly those who have become the target of threats and assaults. The European Union views with the greatest concern the increasing number of threats and assaults made not only against judges and members of the judicial authorities, but also against human rights activists, journalists and political leaders. The European Union <Col N="270" /> utterly condemns these acts, which impede progress in strengthening the rule of law, and urges the Government of Guatemala to protect those targeted and have the incidents investigated, so that legal action can be taken to punish those responsible. The European Union calls upon all Guatemalans to respect human rights and the rule of law. It urges the appropriate authorities to combat impunity before the law and to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Historical Clarification, with special emphasis on the establishment of a follow-up body. The European Union also stresses the importance of the recommendations contained in the REMHI report &ldquo;Guatemala Nunca Más&rdquo; (Guatemala Never Again). The European Union also strongly encourages all Guatemalans, and particularly those in authority, to renew their efforts to implement the Peace Accords, which continue to have a central and fundamental role to play in the strengthening of democracy, national reconciliation and development in Guatemala. Finally, the European Union reiterates the importance of solving the assassination of Monsignor Gerardi, as well as the punishment of the perpetrators, in the framework of efforts to combat impunity and to consolidate a society governed by the rule of law. The European Union looks forward to maintaining constructive bilateral relations with Guatemala based on the respect for human rights and the implementation of the Peace Accords.</P>
    <P>In June 2001, three former military officers were sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for the murder of Bishop Gerardi. While it would be inappropriate to comment on the substance of this verdict as it is the subject of an appeal, this development is undoubtedly significant. Also in June of this year, the state prosecuting authorities initiated investigations into two former military Presidents of Guatemala, General Romeo Lucas Garcia and General Rios Montt, for atrocities allegedly committed by them when in power. Again, while it would not be appropriate to comment on the merits of these individual cases, the significance of the decision to open investigations is apparent. In their ongoing relations with the Guatemalan authorities, Ireland and its EU partners will continue to stress the vital importance of full implementation of the Peace Accords, with particular emphasis on the necessity to investigate all crimes against human rights and to bring those responsible to justice.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is an urgent need to provide a verification process to the Bacteriological and Toxin Weapon Convention; and if he will ensure that the issue is placed on the agenda of the UN Security Council during the Government's presidency in October 2001.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons Convention, BTWC, which prohibits the development, production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons and provides for their destruction came into force in 1975. Ireland firmly supports the need for an effective compliance and verification instrument in the convention and considers that the absence of specified verification measures in the convention text are an impediment to its successful operation. A special conference of BTWC states parties in September 1994 established an <i>ad hoc</i> group to address the matter of devising a verification instrument in the form of a protocol to the convention. Ireland has been extensively engaged in the work of this group. In particular, Ireland has supported efforts to devise an effective verification mechanism, including random visits to possible sites of manufacture of biological weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, it has not been possible as yet to achieve agreement on a protocol between BTWC state parties. In July this year, the USA withdrew from protocol negotiations and indicated that it will pursue other ideas and alternative approaches which it said would have the intention and practical effect of strengthening the BTWC. The Fifth BTWC Review Conference meets in mid November and will consider the current position. For its part, Ireland will continue to advocate the necessity for devising and implementing an effective means of verification with the objective of ensuring compliance with and strengthening of the convention. Within the United Nations system the Security Council does <Col N="272" /> not have primary responsibility for these and other disarmament issues. Ireland considers the forthcoming Review Conference to be an appropriate forum to pursue this objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy on Tibet is centred on the belief that dialogue, on a mutually agreed basis, between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the best means of addressing the fundamental issues of concern in Tibet. The first and foremost of those concerns is human rights. We have called on the Chinese authorities to engage in a meaningful dialogue process with the objective of safeguarding the welfare and rights of the people of Tibet, particularly the right to freedom of expression and the freedom of religion.</P>
      <P>The Government has made known its concerns about reported human rights violations to the Chinese authorities on a number of occasions over many years. The Taoiseach reiterated our position most recently in talks with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Zhu Rongji, during his visit to Dublin at the beginning of September. The situation in Tibet was also raised by our EU partners during the EU-China Summit on 5 September.</P>
      <P>Through the mechanism of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, Ireland and its EU partners closely monitor developments in Chinese policy towards Tibet and progress on individual cases of concern. Among the cases repeatedly raised by the EU with the Chinese authorities is the case of Gendun Choeki Nyima, the Dalai Lama's choice as Panchen Lama. During the last session of the Dialogue in February, the EU reiterated its request that an independent delegation be given access to the Panchen Lama. This case, as well as our wider concerns about the rights of the Tibetan people, will be raised again with the Chinese authorities during the next round of the dialogue in Beijing at the end of October.</P>

      <P>Ireland has brought to UNFPA's attention the allegations made in the letter from Galway for Life. We are informed that there are no UNFPA projects in Tibet. The Government remains concerned about the human rights situation in China, including the effects of China's population control policy on the human rights of the Chinese people and in particular the people of Tibet. We have repeatedly expressed our concerns at every appropriate opportunity to the Chinese authorities, both bilaterally and through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. Most recently, the Taoiseach raised our concerns about the situation in Tibet with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Zhu Rongji, during his visit to Ireland at the beginning of September.</P>
      <P>The UNFPA's programme in China has projects in 32 poor counties. It was requested by the Chinese Government and approved by the 36 member state UNFPA executive board. The programme adheres strictly to the voluntary, human rights-based approach to reproductive health and family planning stipulated by the 1994 UN Cairo Conference on Population and Development and unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The abolition of quotas and targets in the 32 counties was a condition of UNFPA assistance. Funds were released only after the UNFPA field office received official written communication from provincial/local authorities that quotas and targets had been removed from participating counties. It has been agreed with the Chinese Government that the project will follow all UNFPA procedures for monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Government has agreed that the project counties will be open to monitoring visits by foreigners and that county officials would be available to talk to foreign delegations.</P>

      <P>For a number of months, the European Union has been engaged in a dialogue with the Government of Zimbabwe aimed at creating a stable democratic political environment in the country, thereby contributing to the full protection of human rights. The General Affairs Council meeting on 25 June noted a lack of substantial progress in the dialogue and expressed deep concern over recent developments. Ministers stressed that as a first priority the dialogue should yield rapid and tangible results on the following: an end to political violence, and in particular an end to all official encouragement or acceptance of such violence; an invitation to the EU to support and observe coming elections and full access to that end; concrete action to protect the freedom of mass media; independence of the Judiciary and the respect of its decisions and an end of illegal occupation of properties. The Council agreed to closely follow developments in these areas as well as on overall questions regarding the rule of law, economic policies and the land reform over a two month period and to take appropriate measures if substantial progress has not been made.</P>
      <P>In the interim, a meeting of a Commission of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on Zimbabwe took place in Abuja, Nigeria on 6 September. At that meeting, the Zimbabwean delegation gave a number of important assurances, including a commitment to operate the land reform programme in accordance with the rule of law. The General Affairs Council will take up the question of Zimbabwe again later this year, probably at the end of October. At that meeting Ministers will examine progress in the EU's dialogue with Zimbabwe, assess the steps taken by Zimbabwe to implement the commitments it undertook in Abuja and examine the implications of yesterday's interim ruling of the Zimbabwean Supreme Court in relation to the Government's land acquisition programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that Ireland Aid funding for Zimbabwe is spent appropriately and that all funds are properly accounted for. No funding is channelled directly through the Government of Zimbabwe. The Ireland Aid programme in that country is focused on pressing basic needs &ndash; water and sanitation, implemented through UNICEF, HIV / AIDS, through local NGOs, and policy formulation linked to governance, through an independent regional institute. In relation to any possible food aid requirement in Zimbabwe, Ireland Aid will work together <Col N="275" /> with our international and development partners to ensure that food aid is distributed only to those most in need. The Government will continue to impress upon the Government of Zimbabwe through our bilateral contacts and through our membership of the European Union the importance that we attach to the independence of the Judiciary, the rule of law and respect for the democratic process in Zimbabwe.</P>

For this reason, my Department may not be fully aware of all Irish nationals in the countries to which the Deputy refers. Based on the information available to us at the present time, my Department's best estimate of the number of Irish nationals in these countries is as follows: Uzbekistan, 4; Tajikistan, 1; Iran, 79;Iraq, 1; Pakistan, 63.</P>
      <P>We have no information of any Irish nationals in Afghanistan or Turkmenistan.</P>
      <P>Following the terrorist attack in the United States on Tuesday, 11 September, my Department has advised all Irish nationals travelling abroad to exercise extreme vigilance and caution. My Department has advised against all travel to Afghanistan. Irish nationals are advised against travel to Pakistan unless strictly necessary and Irish nationals currently in Pakistan should consider whether their continued presence is necessary. All Irish nationals in the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan are advised to leave those areas immediately.</P>
      <P>In line with established policy, Irish nationals abroad, including those in the countries referred to by the Deputy, may register with the local Irish Embassy or Consulate so that they can be included in emergency plans should this become necessary. Where there is no resident Irish mission, Irish nationals may register with a mission of any other EU member state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of global oil supply arrangements is primarily a matter for the oil industry and in recent decades, oil markets have had considerable success in maintaining supplies to consumers despite occasional events in key producer areas. If, on the other hand, international tensions were to result in a significant oil supply disruption, the response of the consumer countries would be implemented within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the International Energy Agency, IEA, an autonomous OECD body of which Ireland is a member. Under the IEA regime, in return for maintaining 90 day oil reserves and introducing demand restraint measures as necessary, member states would be entitled to a share of available oil in the event of a reduction of at least 7% in normal supply levels. There are also provisions for a co-ordinated international response to an emerging crisis, without the oil sharing component, in advance of the 7% trigger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a major oil supply crisis were to be declared, I would be the Minister with prime responsibility for Ireland's response and my Department, in conjunction with the oil industry and other rel<Col N="278" /> evant public and private sector bodies, would oversee the implementation of the measures necessary to maintain essential supplies. In this regard, under the Fuels Acts, 1971 and 1982, there are significant provisions to empower me, if the Government so authorised, to intervene in relation to regulating or controlling the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of fuels held by the oil companies. These powers would, for example, provide the basis for a range of possible demand restraint measures, including reduced speed limits, traffic restrictions, prioritisation of oil deliveries, harmonisation of garage opening hours and the introduction of a formal rationing scheme. Other measures open to me would be publicity initiatives and the controlled release of the strategic oil stocks held by the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, in line with our EU and IEA obligations. The nature, extent and timing of the interventions and the balance between the various elements in the overall package would depend on the depth and progress of the crisis and its specific impact on the Irish oil products market.</P>
    <P>At present, no interruption of oil deliveries is foreseen, but in view of the volatility of the international situation, the IEA is continuing to monitor developments in consultation with the member states. Meanwhile, my Department is liaising with NORA and the oil industry and all parties are reviewing their respective emergency supply arrangements so as to ensure an efficient, timely and co-ordinated response should I be called upon to exercise my functions in this regard.</P>

      <P>The timing of the Government's decision to establish MediaLab Europe has turned out to be a helpful development as it is now an integral part of our response to dealing with the downturn and positioning the Irish economy for the economic recovery. The slowdown in the high-tech sector, particularly in the USA, has certainly increased the challenge for MediaLab Europe to secure investment from this sector at present. However, MediaLab Europe's primary investment target is European industry and it is in discussion with companies from a diverse range of sectors, beyond just the information, communications and technology, ICT, sector in keeping with the interdisciplinary approach to research at MediaLab Europe. These sectors include, finance, logistics and distribution, motor, retail, <Col N="279" /> manufacturing, consulting, broadcasting and publishing.</P>
      <P>There is now a top class research team in place comprising 40 staff and 20 post-graduate students admitted under MediaLab Europe's two year fellowship programme. These researchers are spread across a number of research groups, covering areas such as the use of technology that can enable or empower people who are otherwise marginalised, interfaces where touch is used instead of or in addition to sight and sound, the dynamics of wireless networks and applications, everyday learning, mobile technologies, use of technology for physical and mental health and the future of music and story networks.</P>
      <P>MediaLab Europe is just one part of a wider, long-term strategy to develop our research and development capacity and move our information, communications and technology, ICT, sector up the value chain. Given the current economic climate, it is all the more important that we continue this approach to ensure that Ireland maintains its position internationally and is ready to take advantage of future growth opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 234 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Regulator was established on a statutory basis earlier this year, pursuant to the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001, for the purpose of determining, <i>inter alia</i>, an appropriate maximum level for airport charges. In exercising his functions, the regulator acts on a completely independent basis as provided for in the Act. There was an extensive debate on the proposed role of the Aviation Regulator when I was piloting the draft legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas last year. All sides contributed strongly and constructively to that debate and I accepted several useful amendments which were proposed both by Government and Opposition parties. I believe that the Act is all the better for those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the contribution of the airports to their regions, I issued, prior to his final determi<Col N="280" /> nation, a direction under section 10 of the Act to the Aviation Regulator, so that he would be aware of the purpose and intent of Government regional development policy. In that context I referred particularly to the objectives of the national development plan and the national spatial strategy and directed that the regulator make every reasonable effort to ensure that the final determination reflects the important emphasis that the Government places on balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the final determination of the regulator, which was published on 27 August, would allow Aer Rianta to levy higher maximum charges at Shannon and Cork Airports compared to Dublin. However, there is nothing in the regulator's determination which obliges Aer Rianta to levy the permitted maxima and Aer Rianta has already stated publicly that it intends that Cork and Shannon Airports remain as competitive as Dublin Airport. As the Deputies will be aware, Aer Rianta does not accept the recent determination of the Aviation Regulator and the company has informed me that the board has decided to appeal the decision of the regulator and to pursue the matter through the courts.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's proposals on the development of the three State airports are in the first instance a matter for Aer Rianta, which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. My Department has already asked Aer Rianta for a considered view on the implications of the regulator's determination for the future development of the company. As regards the proposed new runway at Dublin Airport, the position remains that Aer Rianta has commissioned an environmental impact assessment in connection with the proposed new runway. The global downturn in the aviation industry will have implications for the level of passenger traffic through Dublin Airport, at least in the short-term, and this in turn may impact on Aer Rianta's previous timescale for the second runway at Dublin Airport. Obviously, the company will need to re-examine this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the dramatic impact of the recent terrorists attacks in the US on the global aviation industry, there is a range of urgent new priorities concerning the aviation sector which are being urgently addressed by the Government and by Governments throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> While the concept of a second, independent terminal at Dublin Airport to compete with Aer Rianta's terminal facilities is not new, it does not rank among the immediate priorities that must be addressed in the radically altered aviation environment in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, as the Deputy is aware, I have not adopted any particular ideological position in relation to the concept of competing terminal facilities at Dublin Airport. There are a number of complex considerations both for and against that concept on which my Department has had consultancy advice on more than one occasion in recent years. Generally speaking, that advice did not confirm the value of a competing second terminal as a viable proven concept in practice, but I stress again that I maintain an open mind on the matter.</P>
    <P>If the concept of a second terminal was to be endorsed either by this or any future Government, I have already stated on a number of occasions that it would call for an open and transparent process to determine who will provide the competing terminal. It would also be necessary to determine in advance the detailed operational, legal, regulatory and commercial interface with the wider operation at Dublin Airport.</P>

On foot of the Government's decision of 27 July 2001 to increase the share capital of An Post by £10 million for payment of the increases in postmasters' remuneration recommended by the Flynn report, I decided to establish a partnership forum to oversee developments in the network. The first <Col N="283" /> meeting of the forum which is chaired by Phil Flynn, took place on Monday, 1 October.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are to discuss the principles on progressing the adoption of the agency model on a pilot basis by year end, in the context of the An Post group.

      <P>In view of the concerns expressed by the Irish Postmasters Union in relation to the PostPoint service, this matter was raised with An Post. In May 2000, An Post won a contract from Eircell to install and operate 4,000 credit card terminals in that company's network of &lsquo;Ready to Go' agents. The implementation of this service, which was subsequently branded &lsquo;PostPoint', has been under way since October last year and currently some 2,000 retailers have been connected to the service.</P>
      <P>Had An Post not been successful in winning the contract, it would have been set up and operated by competitors. I am informed that such a service is already provided by An Post through the company's 1,000 automated post offices and this was considered crucial to its winning the contract. I am also informed that Eircell top-ups are available on an over the counter basis at non-automated offices.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate.</P>
      <P>Recently published data indicate a slow down in the rate of growth of Irish telecommunications in the 12 month period to end June. This is being driven in large measure by a global slow down in telecommunications. I have in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives under national policy, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, 26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased to 200 million. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received I signed nine contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of August this year I announced the second call for proposals. The deadline for receipt of proposals is 19 October. Some 55 million is available to promote the investment in communications infrastructure. Three programme lines are supported under the present invitation to tender, these are: (1) commercial broadband roll-outs; (2) commercial DSL roll-out; (3) public projects with economic development and social objectives. Details of these programmes are available at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie.</P>
      <P>I have recently invited expressions of interest in building, financing and operating the Atlantic broadband corridor network. This network is designed to operate as a fibre optic, carriers carrier infrastructure to support development of the north-western, western and south-western regions generally.</P>
      <P>Expressions of interest will be sought from the home and international markets. The responses to that invitation will give me a fuller indication of cost, scale time-line and so forth. This information will form the basis of any final proposals I will bring on the matter to Government.</P>

      <P>This plan includes a proposal for the development of suburban rail services serving Blarney, Cork and Midleton. Irish Rail has undertaken to carry out a feasibility study into the proposal when the Cork area strategic plan is adopted. However, I am informed that a rail link to Bandon was not among the transport options put forward in the final report from the consultants. In the circumstances, I understand Iarnród Éireann does not propose commissioning a feasibility study into this proposal.</P>

The Commission for Electricity Regulation, an independent body, was established under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and took over from ESB the key function of, among others, overseeing access to the transmission and distribution systems and related charges.</P>
      <P>In addition, the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations, 2000, set out the functions of the transmission system operator, distribution system operator and transmission system owner in relation to the transmission and distribution of electricity. These functions are discharged under licence issued by the Commission for Electricity Regulation. In the case of transmission grid, it will be operated by Eirgrid, a new State company independent of ESB. Compliance with licence conditions is a matter for the commission.</P>

      <P>The type of review referred to is a matter for the Commission for Electricity Regulation, CER, which is an independent body established under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. One of the key functions of the commission is to establish, supervise and review a system of trading in electricity in accordance with the terms of the Minister's policy direction of July 1999 relating to trading in electricity. In response to a request from me to examine the competitive difficulties faced by new entrants, the CER replied that it is currently carrying out reviews across a range of areas. These reviews are being carried out with a view to enhancing the economic circumstances for market entry, thereby increasing competitive opportunities and security of supply for customers. In this context, the commission has recently published on its website at www.cer.ie an information note on key strategic deliverables and timeframes for the completion of these reviews.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I understand that the CER has decided to bring forward to September 2001 its review of the price effectiveness of the interim trading and settlement system foreseen in the Minister's policy direction of July 1999. The commission has said that it may modify the pricing arrangements if they do not meet the main objective of the trading arrangements, which is the promotion of efficient competition among licensed generators and suppliers within the market being opened to competition. The CER has indicated that the review will include a thorough analysis of the possibility of the spill price containing a capacity element.</P>

      <P>Under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 2000, Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, has statutory responsibility to develop and maintain an efficient and cost effective gas transmission and distribution system. Extensions to the transmission system require my consent whereas extensions of the distribution network fall exclusively within the day-to-day responsibilities of the board.</P>
      <P>BGE has informed me that two surveys have been completed by Bord Gáis in Callan, County Kilkenny. The surveys were completed in June of 2000 and 2001. The expansion of the gas network into Callan, would require the construction of a transmission pressure reduction installation from the Cork to Dublin pipeline, and the associated large feeder and distribution mains to the town. The costs involved would be so significant that the project would not be financially viable at this time.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year the Government approved, in principle, the extension of the gas network to the north west. Following its initiative to make £10 million available towards the development of the Northern Ireland gas network, which will include a pipeline from Belfast to Derry, the Government has decided to move ahead with the next step in extending the transmission network to the north west. This <Col N="288" /> involves Bord Gáis Éireann being asked to carry out a detailed engineering study which will include a pipeline route from Derry to Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>Based on preliminary analysis already carried out, the construction of a pipeline between Derry and Letterkenny would require grant aid, as the level of demand for gas is not sufficient to pay for the capital cost of the pipeline. The detailed study will identify the level of grant aid necessary for the pipeline. The provision of such grant aid will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>At a meeting of the National Security Committee, which was convened on the evening of the attacks on the US, members of the Cabinet were briefed on the security precautions which had been put in place arising from those attacks. They were also <Col N="291" /> briefed on the Department of Foreign Affairs' humanitarian efforts to trace relatives who might have been caught up in the attacks. A high level contact group was set up to monitor developments and emergency services were asked to ensure their arrangements were fully up to date.</P>
      <P>Since then the National Security Committee has met on a number of occasions and the high level contact group has also met regularly. At the Government meeting on 18 September 2001, arising from a report of the contact group, Ministers were asked to ensure that all necessary measures were being taken to monitor and respond to the evolving international situation.</P>
      <P>In support of the emergency planning authorities in updating their emergency plans it was arranged that the contact group would seek to identify specific additional threats which needed to be taken on board in revised emergency plans. There are ongoing consultations between the group and ordnance experts of the Defence Forces on the issues arising from the threat of chemical and biological weapons. Also, at a meeting in the Department of the Taoiseach of key Departments and agencies involved in emergency planning, arrangements were made for those ordnance experts to assist planning authorities in their review of existing plans to take account, as appropriate, of the requirements of the chemical and biological weapons threat.</P>
      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted has taken place. The attacks on the US have clearly changed the context in which emergency planning must take place. Since the 1980s, the emphasis in planning was on peacetime emergencies, whereas now we are faced with new threats arising from resurgent global terrorism.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances the Government has decided to set up an office of emergency planning in my Department. That office will take the lead role in preparing plans to meet the new threats from global terrorism. The Government has also decided that the office of emergency planning should have an oversight role in relation to planning for peacetime emergencies, in order to make maximum use of resources and to ensure compatibility and co-ordination between plans prepared for peacetime emergencies and for emergencies arising from terrorist threats.</P>

      <P>The tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift <Col N="292" /> helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>Tenders were invited on 5 March 2001 and the closing date was 19 April 2001. Four tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Ltd. from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC Scotia from Scotland.</P>
      <P>The tenders received are being subjected to a comprehensive evaluation process which included visits to each of the four companies involved. This evaluation is being undertaken by a project team comprising officials from my Department and Air Corps personnel assisted by an outside consultant. The team's report will be examined by my Department to ensure policy and procedural compliance, after which negotiations will be entered into with a selected contractor.</P>
      <P>The tender competition for the supply of the helicopters is being carried out under EU contracts procedures. The award of contract criteria set out in the tender documentation state that the contract will be awarded on the basis of the most strategically and economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria, not necessarily in order of priority: (1) functional characteristics; (2) technical merit; (3) all maintenance and on-line technical support; (4) after sales service and warranty terms on offer; (5) cost and ready availability of spare parts; (6) tender prices; (7) life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period. Other factors cannot be taken into account as part of the evaluation process.</P>

      <P>The transfer of a member of the Permanent Defence Force from one service or unit to another, is entirely a matter for the military authorities in the light of operational requirements. Each transfer application is examined by the military authorities having regard to factors such as the manpower level of the unit in which the applicant is serving, the number of transfer applications already in hand, the seniority of the applicant within the unit and the existence of a suitable vacancy in the unit to which he wishes to transfer.</P>
      <P>On 22 June 2001, the individual in question applied for a transfer from 28 Infantry Battalion to 5 Field CIS Company, FCA, Sligo. Due to the embargo on postings/transfers to FCA units the application could not be acceded to by the military authorities. Such transfers have been suspended for some time pending the implementation of the restructuring of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263, 264 and 265 together.</P>
      <P>Following the reorganisation of the Defence Forces effected on 1 November 1998 under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, the number of military hospitals was rationalised from three to one, with the redesignation of the Curragh and Cork hospitals as military medical facilities.</P>
      <P>The military medical facility in Cork is one of the three military medical facilities located at the headquarters of each of the field medical companies. These military medical facilities are in addition to St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of the Medical Corps was embraced as an opportunity to redirect the focus of military medical care in the Defence Forces from a predominantly hospital-based service to one in which primary, occupational and field support medical care would continue to be further developed.</P>
      <P>There is at present a total of 50 personnel working at the military medical facility at Collins Barracks, Cork, comprising five military officers &ndash; three doctors, one dentist, one pharmacist &ndash; 25 non commissioned officers and privates, 12 nurses and eight civilians. With regard to conditions at the MMF at Collins Barracks, Cork, I am advised that in the past ten years new windows, new floors and a new heating system have been installed. At present, the outpatient clinic, dental clinic and filing rooms are being refurbished.</P>
      <P>The military medical facility in Cork has an infirmary for the care of &ldquo;living-in&rdquo; personnel, largely recruits and other training course students, who become injured or ill. There are currently pharmacy, audiometry screening, chiropody, dental, and physiotherapy facilities available at the MMF, Cork. There are three clinics in operation comprising a GP clinic, a specialist medical clinic and a Well Woman clinic. There is a psychiatric/counselling service available. In addition to these primary care services, the out-patient service provides occupational health services which include pre-employment medicals, annual medicals, travel medicine, vaccination programme and audiology seminars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key financial and managerial reforms set out in the Strategic Management Initiative was to establish a system of expenditure reviews in all areas of public spending. The main purpose of these reviews is to ensure the most efficient use of resources by Departments within the financial envelopes agreed by Government. An interdepartmental group has carried out a <Col N="295" /> comprehensive review of the present arrangements for the provision of medical services for the Defence Forces. Its report, on completion, was submitted to the central steering committee for the expenditure review programme for evaluation. I will be further considering the recommendations of the report shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 and 349 together.</P>
      <P>During the foot and mouth crisis, I maintained close contact with my ministerial colleagues in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland with a particular focus on sharing information on developments in regard to the disease.</P>
      <P>Procedures for the disposal off-site of all waste and left-over material, including belly grass from meat processing and all land spreading activities associated with such enterprises, must be undertaken in accordance with a specific nutrient management plan which is provided for under the terms of an integrated pollution control licence. These licences are issued and controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency and the disposal and treatment of all waste may only take place in accordance with the provisions of licences and with the agreement of the EPA.</P>
      <P>The disposal of &ldquo;material of animal origin&rdquo; would fall under swill controls administered by my Department. The Diseases of Animals (Feeding and Use of Swill) Orders, 1985, 1987 and 2001 provide for comprehensive controls on swill as a protective measure against the introduction or spread of disease. In particular, swill processing premises are required to be registered and hygiene and production standards for the transport and processing of swill are established. The feeding of raw swill or swill derived from aircraft, ships or offshore installations is prohibited. In addition, I made orders earlier this year in this context of the FMD, the effect of which are to prohibit the collection and feeding of specified material to animals. This ban encompasses the feeding of domestic, restaurant and other catering waste to all live animals.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the EPA that composting of animal derived material would not be permitted. Such material would have to be treated as swill or disposed of by landfill as incineration is not yet an option.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that local authorities have instructions on these matters as the delegated competent authorities in regions charged with waste disposal management.</P>

      <P>The original closing date for receipt of area aid applications was 30 March 2001 and this was later extended to 27 April 2001. My Department received an application from the person named on 29 May 2001.</P>
      <P>EU regulations provide that when an application is received late a penalty deduction of 1% of any aid payable for each working day that the application is late is incurred and where an application is received more than 25 calendar days late, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>The applicant has been informed of the position. I understand that he is preparing a case in which he will claim <i>force majeure</i> relating to the late submission of his application. He has also lodged an appeal to my Department's appeals unit. My Department will examine any relevant material that the applicant may submit and the outcome will be communicated to him at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Foot and Mouth Disease (Restriction of Import of Vehicles, Machinery and Other Equipment) Order, 2001, as amended, tyres imported from the UK into Ireland required an import licence and certification of cleansing and disinfecting prior to importation. With effect from 5 June 2001 this provision was eased to allow certain imports, including tyres, to be imported from Northern Ireland without licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Import control procedures and inspections are being maintained at ports and airports to ensure compliance with the foot and mouth disease precautionary measures. Our success in containing the spread of this disease in Ireland is due in a large measure to the assistance and co-operation <Col N="299" /> of the general public. If the Deputy has details of breaches of the regulations I will have these investigated.</P>

      <P>This case which involves one of the persons named is not currently under appeal. In his original REPS plan, which commenced on 1 May 1997, the person involved had included an area that was subsequently found to be ineligible for payment. Following a meeting with Department officials in May 2001 he submitted an amended plan, and payments already made on the ineligible area then had to be recovered. In addition, he incurred a 10% penalty on his third annual payment for not carrying out undertakings in his plan in respect of his farmyard. All outstanding payments due to him, taking account of the penalty, the overpayment on the ineligible area and interest, were made on 31 August 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department's local FDS office has provided the Deputy with a copy of a letter that issued to the person involved on 17 August 2001 which gave full details as to the eligible area of his application and the way in which his payments were to be calculated.</P>

    <P>In accordance with Regulation 23 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 94 of 2000), which sets out the procedure for dealing with dormant milk quotas, the <Col N="302" /> person named was notified on 9 July 2001of the Department's proposal to add his quota of 12,765 litres (2,808 gallons) to the national reserve. He was informed that if he did not agree with this proposal he could make observations in writing within 30 days.</P>
    <P>On 3 August 2001, observations were received and following further consideration of the matter, the Department confirmed the surrender of the quota to the national reserve as from 1 April 2001. This decision has been communicated directly to the person named.</P>
    <P>As the milk quota is added to the national reserve, it is no longer available for use by the person named. The regulations specifically provide, however, that should he resume milk production in his own right, he may apply to the Minister for the return of that quota to his benefit, and that the Minister shall grant that quota to the applicant no later than 1 April following the date of his application, provided that such an application has been received by the Minister prior to the 1st day of the preceding January.

The rate of aid is 40% of approved eligible costs and generally investments exceeding 100,000 (c£80,000) will be considered for assistance. Eligible projects will be assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Abattoirs fall within the ambit of the processing and marketing provisions of the EU guidelines for State aid in the agricultural sector.

    <P>While the bovine tuberculosis eradication programme operated by my Department is extremely comprehensive, I have to accept that progress towards final eradication has been disappointing. However, as the above statistics indicate there has been a reduction in the number of TB reactors in the country by about 4,000 in the year 2000 and I anticipate a similar reduction in 2001. While there has been an increase in the number of reactors in County Mayo it still remains one of the counties with the lowest number of reactors in the country.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a number of measures with the objective of reducing current levels of and ultimately eradicating TB from the national herd. Among the measures provided for is the allocation of specified staff resources in each district veterinary office (DVO) to carry out investigative work into the causes of herd breakdowns. In addition to current arrangements relating to wildlife, a pro-active approach is being undertaken in each DVO area using dedicated departmental and <Col N="312" /> farm relief service personnel to the removal of all sources of infection in the 20% of the country that yields some 50% of current TB reactors.</P>
    <P>Also a research programme involving disciplines in zoology, microbiology, immunology and pathology is in place. A wildlife removal project and a vaccine development project are among the scientific work being carried out. The veterinary epidemiology and tuberculosis investigation unit, based in the veterinary college, investigates the factors which militate against the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle at the national or regional levels, and identifies means of improving the present rate of eradication.</P>

The EU-imposed ceiling for expenditure under this scheme has been reached and my Department has applied to the EU Commission to formally raise the ceiling.

      <P>The conditions governing the REP scheme do not stipulate a maximum number of livestock units that may be carried on a holding. That is determined in each individual case. Each application for REPS must be accompanied by an agri-environment plan drawn up by an approved REPS planner in consultation with the farmer. This includes a nutrient management plan which determines the carrying capacity of the land. The nutrient management plan is based on soil analysis reports and must comply with the REPS specifications. REPS is a voluntary scheme which promotes extensive farming practices.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline Government policy regarding the marketing of Irish beef within the EU and worldwide; the body which is responsible for implementing this policy or strategy; the professional marketing skills which have been employed to ensure its success; and the initiatives which have been taken in recent months to add value to the product, restore consumer confidence and gain shelf space in the supermarkets of the EU and other world markets.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that all possible markets for beef are open to Irish exporters. This was the situation pertaining prior to the BSE crisis in Europe late last year when Irish beef producers were exporting their product to more than 60 countries worldwide. Arising from the market difficulties in Europe last year, every effort at political, diplomatic and technical level is being made to ensure the earliest possible re-opening of these important markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Bia is the body charged with promoting the sale of Irish beef and other food products worldwide and underpinning the marketing endeavours of our food companies. That body works in partnership with my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs through our embassies abroad and with the beef industry to develop and maintain markets. An important <Col N="316" /> plank in Bord Bia's strategy is to develop long-term relationships between Irish exporters and overseas buyers through participation at international food fairs and co-ordination of inward market intelligence visits. Promotional programmes are also developed to support marketing activities which offer a range of solutions to provide distinctiveness and competitive edge to Irish products through advertising, media relations and point of sale material and other tools. Bord Bia is equipped with the appropriate expertise to carry out these functions.</P>
    <P>As recently as this week, Bord Bia organised and ran a very successful seminar in Dublin entitled Building Confidence in Beef which was targeted at those concerned with taking the key decisions in the purchasing and marketing of beef in the European marketplace.</P>
    <P>Marketing of beef is also very much concerned with providing the necessary guarantees in relation to the safety of the product. In this context, BSE has been the dominant issue in recent years. In that regard, my Department has a vital role to play in ensuring that that all necessary BSE controls are in place and effectively implemented. Irish BSE controls are among the strictest in the world and the quality of those controls has been recognised by the European Union's Scientific Steering Committee, which has classified Ireland's BSE situation as &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo; since 1998. These rigorous control measures mean that consumers are afforded the maximum possible guarantees about the safety of Irish beef.</P>

      <P>The person named began his participation in REPS in October 1998. A cross-compliance check subsequently raised important issues regarding the area declared in his agri-environmental plan. He submitted a revised plan in November 2000 but it contained mapping errors. A second revised plan was submitted in March 2001, but examination of it necessitated an on-farm visit and this could not take place while the foot and mouth disease restrictions prevented REPS inspections.</P>
      <P>This most recent plan has now been examined by my Department but it does not address adequately the deficiencies noted in the previous versions. My Department will write to the person named and to his planner this week, setting out the problems and requesting that the plan be revised to correct them.

    <P>An inspection of the premises by veterinary inspectors of my Department took place on 11 July 2001.

My Department issued a letter on 9 August 2001, informing the applicant <Col N="318" /> that a licence could not issue under these circumstances.

    <P>A further inspection was carried out by veterinary inspectors of my Department on 4 September 2001 at the applicant's request. However, while some improvements to the premises had been made since the previous inspection, these were inadequate and did not meet the requirements for a licence as laid down in the Acts. The applicant was informed verbally, on 4 September 2001, by the Department's inspectors of the outcome of the inspection and advised that the premises could not be recommended for a licence as it still did not meet the relevant requirements.</P>

      <Quest>the reason regional veterinary laboratories are unable to deal with adult cattle over 24 months of age; his views on whether this curtails the laboratory from giving its normal excellent service to veterinary surgeons and farmers; if he will allow the infer test to be carried out on such animals at the laboratory; if he will make funding available to improve the holding facilities for such carcasses at the laboratories; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the rapid testing of cattle for BSE. Since 1 July 2001, Ireland, in common with other member states of the European Union, is obliged to rapid test all bovine animals over 30 months of age, and all fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age, for BSE. Samples are taken, principally at slaughterhouses and knackeries, and the carcasses are detained overnight at the premises at which the samples are taken until a BSE test result is available the following morning.</P>
      <P>To date in 2001, more than 320,000 cattle have been rapid tested for BSE in Ireland. The imposition of this large scale industrial type work on the regional veterinary laboratories of my Department would in fact prevent them from providing to farmers and veterinary practitioners the very valuable laboratory support service for disease surveillance which they continue to provide at present. Rapid testing for BSE is at present being carried out at a private laboratory in Newbridge, County Kildare, and to date this arrangement is working well.</P>

      <P>Against the backdrop of continuing concern in relation to foot and mouth disease (FMD), the gathering together of animals from different herds and flocks without appropriate control, regulation and supervision and without adequate provision for traceability of movement is undesirable. Any authorised gathering will only be permitted subject to the establishment by the event organisers of a protocol, by agreement with the Department, to ensure that the appropriate safeguards are put in place in connection with the event. These will include general controls, conditions for acceptance of animals for sale, cleansing / disinfection of event area and vehicles, veterinary presence, identification, documentation and record keeping, traceability arrangements, species mixing, detection of suspicious, unusual or inappropriate transactions or movements, retention period, pick-up / delivery of animals etc. While certain events may have been regarded as traditional, it does not necessarily follow that they are consistent with current and prospective requirements in relation to ani-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> mal health, disease prevention, traceability and other key concerns.</P>
    <P>The BSE, and latterly FMD experiences have highlighted the need to critically question and where necessary alter traditional approaches to various aspects of the livestock trade in the interests of ensuring that the sector can have a viable future. Traditional fairs can be no more exempt from this necessary re-appraisal than any other feature of the livestock trade.</P>
    <P>Finally, it should be noted that the sale by auction of livestock must only be conducted in a licensed mart premises, as provided for under the Livestock Marts Act, 1967, as amended.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced new postal arrangements for the submission of area aid applications in 2001 particularly to give applicants a guarantee of delivery. Applicants were advised that, by submitting their application through the Swiftpost system, delivery was guaranteed and, also, the Swiftpost receipt issued by An Post would be accepted as proof of posting their application. Alternatively, if applicants preferred, they could lodge their application at any of the Department's offices where they would also be issued with a receipt. Applicants are advised to keep a photocopy of their application.</P>
      <P>It was also made very clear in the Department's helpsheet that the pre-printed Swiftpost receipt would be the applicant's proof of date of posting. The helpsheet also stated that in the event of the Department not receiving a 2001 application, the applicant would be required to produce the Swiftpost receipt as proof of postage. The vast majority of applicants used the Swiftpost method thus avoiding difficulties in relation to date of posting or delivery of the application. It was precisely to prevent the situation that has arisen with the person named that the new arrangements were put in place. In the case of the person named, no application was received by my Department before the area aid closing date of 27 April 2001. A certificate of posting dated 24 April 2001 was however submitted in August 2001 along with a newly completed application form as no photocopy of the original was available. Any such case arising must be considered by my Department with a view to establishing if there are mitigating circumstances which will allow the late receipt of the application without penalty. Having considered the submission</P>
      <P>made by the person named, my Department</P>
      <P>has decided to accept the application without penalty.</P>

The EU-imposed ceiling for expenditure under this scheme has been reached and my Department has applied to the European Commission to formally raise the ceiling. A number of payments under the scheme, including payment to the person mentioned in the question, has been delayed pending receipt of this formal approval. Following recent discussions between my Department and the European Commission a positive response is expected very shortly. All payments will issue immediately approval is received.</P>

      <P>EU regulations pro<Col N="328" /> vide that applications under the EU suckler cow premium scheme shall be submitted within an overall period of six months during a calendar year.</P>
      <P>The last year in which there were two application periods during a calendar year was in respect of the 1999 EU suckler cow premium scheme. Under the 2000 EU suckler cow premium scheme the application period was from 3 April 2000 to 31 May 2000 with a late application concession to depopulated and restricted herds up to and including 3 October 2000. Under the 2001 EU suckler cow premium scheme farmers were allowed to submit their application at a time of their choosing between 2 January and 29 June 2001. This change of application period was well signalled at the time.</P>
      <P>My Department's records show that in the years prior to 2001 the person named submitted his applications under the EU suckler cow premium schemes at the end of May or early June of the year of application.</P>
      <P>As the person named was a previous applicant under the EU suckler cow premium schemes he should have received a personalised 2001 suckler cow premium application form in the post at the end of December 2000. Clause 25 of the terms and conditions of the scheme provides that the responsibility for ensuring that the application is lodged rests entirely with the applicant.</P>

      <P>The national carcase classification results for all sex categories for 1999 and 2000 are given in the following annexe.</P>
      <P>Classification data on an individual slaughter plant basis commenced only in 2000. Accordingly, this data is not available for 1999. Classification data for 2001 is not yet available because of the complication arising from the purchase of approximately 278,000 cattle into the EU purchase for destruction scheme. Of necessity, the classification results for these non-commercial purchases had to be maintained separately from normal commercial slaughterings. The process of consolidating both sets of classification results is now almost complete and it is hoped that the individual slaughter plant results for the first three quarters of 2001 will be available by the end of the month. I will arrange for the data to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>The person named applied under the 2000 cattle headage scheme and the 2000 suckler cow scheme on 31 May 2000.</P>
      <P>At an inspection of his herd carried out on 4 October 2000, five cows, tag numbers DPSR0043P, DPSR0038G, DPSR0040V, DPSR0037J and DPSR0041T, were rejected for grants under the cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes as they had no passports. Three other animals, tag numbers 231148110095, 231148160100 and 231148180102, were also rejected under the cattle headage scheme, as they had no passports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department wrote to him on 8 December 2000 advising him that as he was in breach of the terms and conditions of the cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes, in relation to ani<Col N="336" /> mal identification and registration requirements, a reduction penalty of 16% would apply under the 2000 cattle headage scheme and a reduction penalty of 27.5% would apply to his 2000 suckler cow premium application. He was given the opportunity to have these decisions reviewed. His application for a review was received in my Department on 1 May 2001. He was written to on 19 June 2001 informing him that his application under the 2000 cattle headage scheme remained subject to a 16% penalty and the 27.5% penalty under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme was reduced to 23.69%. Payments under both schemes issued on this basis. He was given the opportunity to appeal the Department's decision by writing to the Headage and Premia Appeals Unit, Agriculture House, Kildare Street, Dublin 2, within 21 days. No appeal was received from the person named.</P>

      <P>The person named began her participation in REPS on 1 March 1996. The fifth and final year of her contract began on 1 March 2000 and her application for the fifth year payment should have been received by 30 April 2000 to avoid penalties for late application. It was not received however until 6 April 2001, after her REPS contract had ended.</P>
      <P>On 15 May 2001 the person named requested a review, on the grounds of illness, of the decision to withhold her fifth year payment. On 12 June, my Department asked her to submit a medical certificate showing the duration of her illness. However, the medical evidence she then provided was not specific about the time or duration of her illness and did not give grounds for my Department to change its decision. If she can submit further and more specific medical evidence, however, my Department will consider it and I have asked my officials to inform her of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>An agreement signed with Libya in June of last year provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement &ndash; in so far as it relates to cattle exports &ndash; signed with Libya last year is fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Egyptian market, the position is that since the ban was imposed late last year, ongoing contact with the Egyptian authorities has been maintained at political, diplomatic and technical levels. Arising from these contacts, a delegation headed by the Egyptian chief veterinary officer visited Ireland in August to review the situation here. The Egyptian authorities are currently considering the report of <Col N="338" /> their delegation's visit. Intensive political, diplomatic and technical contact is ongoing with the Egyptian side with a view to achieving the earliest possible reopening of this important market.</P>

      <P>The level of the current ewe premium varies as it is calculated by reference to a single income loss across the EU, which is determined by prices prevailing throughout the Community.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the sheepmeat regime, the EU Commission presented its proposals for reform of the regime last May. The main element in these proposals is that the current variable ewe premium should be replace by a fixed premium of 21 euros.</P>
      <P>Discussions on these proposals have been taking place over the past few months and the opinion of the European Parliament is awaited. It is expected that negotiations will be concluded towards the end of the year and I will be pressing our case to have the premium fixed at the optimum level and for the best possible support regime for Irish sheep producers in the course of these discussions.</P>

      <P>Some 2,500 applications have been received in respect of the schemes of investment aid for farm waste management and for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards in the local farm development services offices of my Department. Just over 50% of these applications have now been examined and of these approximately 560 have been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attach great importance to the availability of these schemes to young farmers and in this context young trained farmers who have first commenced farming within five years of making an application on either of these schemes will qualify <Col N="340" /> for additional aid at the rate of 15% in the less favoured areas and 5% in the rest of the country. As regards participation by young farmers in the REP scheme, this is voluntary; the REP scheme is open to all farmers who comply with its terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>The processing of applications under both the on-farm investment schemes and the REP scheme has suffered serious delays arising out of the foot and mouth crisis. A large proportion of technical agricultural officers who are the people who carry out the necessary checks under these schemes &ndash; remain assigned to foot and mouth duties and while the threat of this disease remains we cannot afford to relax our vigilance. Every effort is being made to process the backlog of applications on hand with the resources available but there are no plans to compensate applicants for delays.</P>

      <P>OSI has no objection to its maps being available in public libraries for viewing and reference purposes. This is currently the case with OSI mapping contained in proposed road corridors schemes and local authority development plans.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out, however, that the maps themselves, either individually or as a set, have a commercial value and are made available to the public through Ordnance Survey Ireland and a network of approved map sales agents, bookshops and other retail agents. Were OSI to make these maps available with no regard to their commercial value, it would damage other parts of the product delivery chain. In particular it would commercially undermine approved map sales agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All OSI mapping is copyright Government of Ireland. As such it cannot be reproduced in any form, including photocopying, without permission. The copyright is administered by OSI, which is mandated by the Minister for Finance to carry on its activities in a manner designed to ensure that the revenue it earns for the Exchequer is maximised. Copyright and royalty fees are an important source of income for OSI. Therefore it would not be possible to make these <Col N="344" /> maps available even at a small cost for photocopying.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are other independent map publishers operating within the Irish economy and any attempt to flood the market with photocopies of high quality mapping may be interpreted as anti competitive practice in a commercial market.</P>
    <P>The Discovery series maps retail at £5.20 for an individual sheet or a special price of £300 for a full set of 75 maps. Each map sheet covers a ground area of 30x40 kilometres on a paper area of 60cm x 80cm. The detail on the maps include every path and laneway with symbols to show individual houses and OSI is satisfied that the retail price of £5.20 is reasonable.</P>
    <P>OSI has a variety of mapping products available. The entire island of Ireland covered by holiday series (scale 1:250,000) consists of four map sheets at a cost of £4.95 each. These maps are quite detailed and produced from a reduced data set of the discovery series. Also available is a complete road atlas of Ireland at scale of 1:210,000, at a cost of £8.50. This publication includes a gazetteer of place names with map references. In general members of the public would buy these maps and then possibly supplement them with a detailed discovery series sheet in an area of particular interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 465 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for an incapacitated child tax credit of £238 for the short tax year 2001. The tax credit can be claimed by a parent or guardian in respect of a child who: is under 18 years of age and is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity &ndash; a child under 18 is regarded as permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity only if the infirmity is such that if the child were over 18 there would be a reasonable expectation that he/she would be incapacitated from maintaining himself/herself, if over 18 years of age at the beginning of the year of assessment, is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself and had become so permanently incapacitated before reaching 21 years of age or becomes permanently incapacitated after reaching the age of 21 but while still in full-time education or while training for a trade or profession for a minimum of 2 years.</P>
      <P>Where a claimant has more than one incapacitated child, a tax credit may be claimed for each child. The legislation provides that where the claimant is not the parent of the child, he or she must have custody of the child and must maintain the child at his or her own expense in order to qualify for the incapacitated child tax credit. Generally speaking, foster parents are paid a weekly foster care allowance from the relevant health board for the maintenance of each child being fostered. This currently amounts to £200 per week for a child under 12 years of age and £220 per week for a child aged 12 or over. In those circumstances the foster parent could not be regarded as maintaining the child at his or her own expense and is not eligible to claim the incapacitated child tax credit, even if the foster parent has custody of the child.</P>

      <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is largely subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero rated before 1 January 1991 we cannot introduce any new zero rate of VAT and cannot, therefore, relieve the monitoring charge for pendant alarms of VAT. While the Sixth VAT Directive provides for reduced rating of certain goods and services, in certain circumstances, none of these apply to the provision of alarm monitoring services. I would add that under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order, 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system, as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this Order. Applicants should contact Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayment (Unregistered Section) Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare (Telephone LoCall 1890 20 20 33).</P>

      <P>Employees in the private sector paying Class A PRSI contribution rates are liable for PRSI on a weekly earnings, non cumulative basis, as follows &ndash; under £30 per week, no employee contribution is payable and the individual is covered only for occupational injuries benefit; £30 &ndash; £226 per week, no employee contribution is payable, but the individual is covered for the full range of benefits; £226.01-£280 per week, the employee receives a weekly PRSI allowance of £100 and pays a contribution rate of 4% on the balance; earnings in excess of £280 per week, the employee receives his/her £100 weekly PRSI allowance and pays a rate of 4% on the balance. However, a health levy of 2%, which is unrelated to the PRSI but which is collected through that system, becomes payable on the first £1 of weekly income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retired persons or employees over the age of 66 years who may be in subsidiary employment <Col N="348" /> are not liable for PRSI contributions. Medical card holders, which now includes all aged 70 and over, are not liable for the 2% health levy contribution. The position with regard to the health levy is that the low income threshold below which the levy is not payable, is currently £14,560 per annum or £280 per week. Arising from the change in the tax year to a calendar year basis, the annual threshold will be £10,775 for the 2001 short tax year, that is, 74% of the current threshold of £14,560. I have no plans to adjust either the annual or weekly thresholds at this point. However, as is normal, I will look at all these issues in the context of the annual budget.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>I announced the Government's response to the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions on 28 September 2001. The Government has decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and intends to establish the working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the programme for prosperity and fairness. The operational details of the implementation of the commission's recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group, to be made within six months of this decision.</P>
      <P>Parallel structures, subject to the same time frame and remit, will be established in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. Arrangements will also be made to facilitate pensioner group representation in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy. In its examination of the pay of public service employees <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector, the Public Service Benchmarking Body is required to take into account the differences in conditions of employment and other relevant benefits of both groups, including superannuation benefits. For that reason, the Government has decided to communicate to the benchmarking body its decisions on the commission report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently in discussion with the public services committee of the ICTU regarding union participation on the working group to advise on implementation of the commission's report. As regards pension increases, <Col N="349" /> the House will be aware that in its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. The Commission on Public Service Pensions made recommendations on the form in which future pension increases should be made and, accordingly, these will come within the remit of the implementation working group to which I have referred. As I have already noted, arrangements will be made to facilitate pensioner group representation in relation to the commission recommendations on pensions increase policy.</P>

    <P>I understand that the Deputy is particularly interested in the number of vehicles seized in cases where exemption from vehicle registration tax &ndash; VRT &ndash; under the transfer of residence provisions was refused. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their records are not kept so as to allow a precise figure to be given of the number of vehicles seized for that reason alone. However, Revenue estimate that less than 0.5% of vehicle seizures arise from failed applications for transfer of residence relief from VRT. In practice, such cases are almost always settled through the appeal process either by (a) the registration of the vehicle without payment of VRT, in the case of a successful appeal, (b) the registration of the vehicle on payment of VRT where the appeal process proves unsuccessful or was not pursued in the first instance or (c) the removal of the vehicle from the State.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to abolish vehicle registration tax  &ndash; VRT. VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer, especially given this Government's strategy of reducing other taxes such as income tax and corporation tax. VRT is payable on the first registration of a vehicle in the State and applies to both new and second hand cars. Despite what may be believed, Ireland is not the only member state which has a tax on vehicle registration. Eight other countries have a registration tax, including Denmark, Finland, Greece and Portugal, some at higher levels than apply in Ireland. These taxes are operated in a variety of ways, and as such, are not directly comparable with VRT as applied in Ireland. However, under EU rules, certain vehicles brought into the State on a temporary basis by tourists and visitors are exempted from the registration requirement. In addition, vehicles brought into the State by per<Col N="351" /> sons transferring their residence here may be registered here without payment of VRT, subject to certain conditions, in particular relating to the length of time a vehicle has been owned and used abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated my stance on the Tobin tax in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Sargent on 3 April of this year, Parliamentary Question No. 70. Advocates of this tax would seek to impose a world wide tax on all foreign exchange transactions to reduce exchange rate volatility and to raise revenue to support international development. However, there are many difficulties identified by commentators in relation to the tax. Most recently, the Zedillo report, that was commissioned by the UN Secretary General to look at the issue of development finance concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;the merits of a currency transaction tax remain highly controversial.&rdquo;  The authors of the report added that &ldquo;further rigorous study is needed before any definitive conclusion is reached on the feasibility and convenience of a Tobin tax.&rdquo;  An earlier report from the Finnish Ministry of Finance, in November 2000 also pointed to the many problems associated with the Tobin tax proposal.</P>
      <P>As is known, the matter was discussed at the recent informal ECOFIN meeting in Liege on 22 September. With regards to the Belgian Presidency proposal to examine the feasibility of a Tobin type tax, the Presidency wishes to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal and it is not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission will ensure that satisfactory answers are given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to its practical implementation; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other non-taxable alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the special half-rate old age contributory pension which gave increased recognition to social insurance contributions paid prior to 1953 and which was introduced in May 2000. This is a special measure targeted at a specific group, namely those people who had paid contributions prior to 1953 but at a rate which failed to meet the yearly average test. The yearly average figure is arrived at by dividing a person's total number of contributions, either paid or credited since 1953 &ndash; or since the persons first started insurable employment &ndash; by the number of years since 1953 or since commencement of insurable employment. A yearly average of at least 48 full rate contributions must be made to qualify for a maximum rate contributory old age pension. Alternatively, a person with a yearly average of 48 full rate contributions since 1979 <Col N="354" /> may also qualify for a full rate pension. A yearly average of at least ten full rate contributions is required to qualify for a minimum, that is, half rate contributory old age pension. To qualify for the special half-rate old age contributory pension, a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance. This new pension is not payable in addition to any other social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>I would point out that it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments, including pre-1953 contributory pensions, are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes. Treating such benefits as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation will actually arise in a given case will essentially depend on the level of other income that a recipient or the recipient's spouse has in the same tax year. I have no plans to change this at present.</P>

      <P>According to the Revenue Commissioners, there are approximately 7,500 beneficiaries under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme. While definitions of disability vary, I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. The cost of the scheme was approximately £22 million in 2000. I expect the cost to rise this year to the region of £25 million.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a repayment arose in this case following the finalisation of the taxpayer's liability for the tax years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 in respect of credit for relevant contracts tax &ndash; RCT &ndash; withheld from payments received by the taxpayer as a sub-contractor during the relevant tax years. In October 2000, prior to the income tax, VAT, and RCT tax returns being submitted, the accountant sent a letter to the inspector, signed by the taxpayer and his wife, &ldquo;mandating&rdquo; the inspector to make the refund(s) due, direct to the accountant. Because of difficulties associated with making tax repay<Col N="355" /> ments to third parties, including the possible involvement of Revenue in creditor &ldquo;preference&rdquo; issues, it is not Revenue practice to repay tax overpaid by a taxpayer to a third party even if requested to do so. Accordingly the cheque for the tax repayment issued to the taxpayer at his home address, which is the official address on record. It is regretted that the Inspector of Taxes omitted to advise the accountant that this request could not be facilitated and a letter of apology is being sent to him.</P>

      <P>The rate of stamp duty is set out in stamp duty legislation which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by Revenue that prior to the Deputy's question they had no record of this case and there is insufficient detail in the letter accompanying the parliamentary question to allow them to determine the stamp duty due in this particular case. Prior to 15 June 2000 stamp duty on the purchase of a house was determined by virtue of the value of the property and ranged from 9% down to nil. The rate of 3% mentioned in the parliamentary question applied to a house between £60,001 and £100,000 at the time in question. From 15 June 2000 stamp duty was determined by virtue of the value of the property and the status of the purchaser either as a first time buyer, an owner-occupier or an investor. Transitional arrangements were introduced to allow the purchaser of a house to opt to have the stamp duty rate in force prior to 15 June 2000 applied to the deed of transfer, should it be <Col N="356" /> more favourable, where the purchase of a house was the subject of a contract evidenced in writing prior to 15 June 2000 and provided the deed was executed on or before 31 January, 2001 &ndash; extended to 31 July 2001 under the Finance Act, 2001. Revenue has been in touch with the purchasers' solicitor to establish the full facts in this matter and to determine if the transitional arrangements apply. They will arrange for a deed of transfer to be stamped at the appropriate rate of stamp duty following an examination of the circumstances in the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil Service is the area for which I have direct responsibility. The position there is that, prior to 31 July 1973, the law required that female employees had to resign on marriage. In such cases, employees under pension age who had given at least five years service, six years prior to 1968, qualified for marriage gratuities of 1/12th of salary per year of service, subject to a maximum of one year's salary.</P>
      <P>While the information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of women who had to resign on marriage is not available, I can say that, in the period 1962 to 1973, some 1,240 marriage gratuities were paid to civil servants. On the basis of a sample of 30 of these cases, the direct cost of providing pensions for these 1,240 former officers would be about £2.5 million or 3.2 million a year; there would also be once-off lump sum payments of about £5 million or 6.4 million. This would be a minimum cost as pensions and lump sums would also be payable in respect of women who resigned from the Civil Service on marriage before 1962. Furthermore, any decision to provide pensions for officials who resigned on marriage before 1973 would have wide ramifications in relation to employees who left the public service before the introduction of preserved pension entitlements in the 1970s.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, I must confirm that the Minister for Finance has no function whatsoever in the determination of whether a person does or does not meet the strict medical criteria in order to qualify for the various concessions under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme. In order to qualify for relief under the scheme, an applicant must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>I understand that the issue of the required medical certificate has been refused in this case and that this refusal has been appealed to the Medical Board of Appeal.</P>
      <P>I am advised, however, that because of the number of appeals currently being made, a considerable backlog has developed and that it may be some months before the board is in a position to carry out its assessment. This backlog seems to be exacerbated by the fact that many of those who appeal to the board are aware that they do not meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations but still insist on exercising their right of appeal. However, the board will make an appointment for the person concerned as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's preparations for the changeover to the euro are on target. Briefly, these preparations fall under the broad headings of legislation, <Col N="360" /> internal preparations, and general monitoring of public sector preparations.</P>
      <P>Legislation dealing with the adoption of the euro was put in place at EU level and national level some years ago. More recently, the Euro Changeover (Amounts) Act, 2001, provided for the substitution, with effect from 1 January 2002, of convenient euro amounts for Irish pound amounts at specific references in listed Acts and statutory instruments. This included a number of areas of law arising under my Department or agencies under its aegis. The Finance Act, 2001, provided a framework of convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002 in the tax code. In all cases of change to convenient euro amounts, the principle of favouring the citizen was followed. Irish pound amounts in law that are not changed by national legislation will of course convert to euro on 1 January 2002 at the conversion rate, under Council Regulation (EC) No. 974/98.</P>
      <P>I made an order to withdraw legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins at midnight on 9 February 2002, as recommended in Ireland's cash changeover plan on 11 July 2001. This order had previously been approved in draft form by both Houses of the Oireachtas. I also made orders in July dealing with the calling-in of Irish pound coins, and with the design of euro coins and the commencement of the power to issue such coins. All of these orders were made under the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998. Internal preparations include the conversion of the Department's payroll, financial management and other computer systems, all of which is on target: indeed the payroll for the Department's staff was converted to euro in July 2001. Staff training is also proceeding. Since 1 January 1999 the accounts of the Exchequer and the Paymaster General with the Central Bank have been in euro and transactions between them, the Central Bank and the commercial banks have also been in euro. Also since 1 January 1999 budgetary, financial and economic publications provide summary information in euro. Arrangements for processing the remainder of the Department's financial transactions in euro from 1 January 2002 are well in hand. From that date all the Department's publications will be in euro. For a limited period summary information will be given in Irish pounds also. The Estimates for 2002 and the forthcoming budget are being prepared in euro. Since 1 January 1999, Revenue has provided its business customers with the facility of conducting their tax and customs affairs in Irish pounds or euro and Revenue has also been processing euro returns and euro payments for a small proportion of its customers since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While each Government Department is responsible for its own euro preparations and those of the bodies under its aegis, their progress on preparations is monitored by my Department, and their reports confirm that these preparations continue to be satisfactory. In this context, production of euro banknotes and coins by the Cen<Col N="361" /> tral Bank is on target. The Department has of course an external role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the changeover, via the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI. The ECBI has carried out extensive public information activities since its establishment in 1998. These have included sending a leaflet to every household in 1998, 1999, 2000 and again this year, widespread circulation of posters and leaflets, provision of a local inquiry line &ndash; 1890 20 10 50 &ndash; and website, www.euro.ie, distribution of information packs to schools and of guidelines to every teacher, and the making available of a train-the-trainers pack. National TV, radio and press campaigns commenced in late 2000. The needs of low-awareness and special needs groups are addressed through the board's consultative panel, and many of the projects in the board's programme of part-funding for non-governmental organisations carrying out euro information activities relate to these groups.</P>
    <P>More recently, the board has arranged for the distribution to every household of a handbook on the changeover to the euro during the month of October. A copy of the handbook has been sent to every Member of the Oireachtas together with a copy of the board's third annual report, covering the board's activities in the period 1 May 2000-30 April 2001.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards parliamentary questions, my Department will as a general rule, except where the context or the volume of data sought clearly requires otherwise, arrange that monetary values in replies to such questions will be shown in euro and Irish pounds between now and 1 January 2002 and for a reasonable period thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the pros and cons of particular approaches to investments in roads is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In general terms, I can say that at the heart of the PPP approach is the concept that better value for money can be achieved for suitable projects through the utilisation of private sector expertise, enhanced scope for innovation, the use of whole life costings through the integration of design, construction and operational functions and the accelerated delivery of public infrastructure. As with every infrastructure project, there are requirements and procedures to ensure that the Exchequer is getting best value for money and that the business case for proceeding with a project on a PPP basis stands up when compared with the alternative of proceeding on a traditional basis. It is Government policy that <Col N="362" /> each PPP project will be evaluated on its merits and that PPP projects will be pursued where it can be demonstrated that there is value for money to the Exchequer over the lifetime of the PPP contract.</P>

      <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. EU VAT rules also determine the extent to which items can be reduced rated. The standard rate of VAT applies to motorcycle helmets and to a wide range of goods and services. The Sixth VAT Directive does provide for reduced rating as low as 5% for certain goods and services. However, motorcycle helmets are not included in this list of goods and services. It is, therefore, not within my power to introduce a reduced rate as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 401 and 440 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum educational requirements for entry to the nursing diploma programmes are set by An Bord Altranais. In addition to meeting those requirements, applicants must also satisfy the individual requirements of the third level institutions involved in the operation of the programmes. I should explain that it is not the educational requirements but the large volume of applications from school leavers interested in a career in nursing that determines the points needed to gain a place on the programmes. In response to a recommendation by the Commission on Nursing, the application system for places on the nursing diploma programmes has been transferred to the CAO from this year onwards. In April 2000, An Bord Altranais, which manages the Nursing Careers Centre, proposed to my Department that both the written assessment test and interview be discontinued for school leaver applicants under the CAO nursing application system from 2001. It also proposed that the selection of school leavers for nursing should be based on points obtained in the leaving certificate examination in the same way as applications for other third level courses. The Nursing Education Forum, which was composed of representatives of both the health and education sectors, including my Department and the Depart<Col N="364" /> ment of Education and Science, endorsed the proposals of An Bord Altranais when my Department sought its views on the matter in May 2000. Mature applicants for places on the nursing diploma programmes must undertake a written aptitude test and an interview, as in previous years.</P>

In most nuclear accident situations staying indoors and avoiding consumption of certain foods that may be contaminated would be the advice given. The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the national nuclear emergency plan was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I have accepted this recommendation and my Department is making the necessary arrangements for the purchase and distribution of these tablets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nursing Careers Centre, which is managed by An Bord Altranais, handles arrangements for the annual intakes of students, both school leavers and mature, to the nursing diploma programmes. From this year, in line with a recommendation of the Commission on Nursing, the application system for places on those programmes is being administered by the Central Applications Office, CAO, in close co-operation with the Nursing Careers Centre, NCC. The NCC administered the special requirements for entry to nursing for mature code applicants. Included in the special requirements was a written assessment and a pass/fail interview. The outcome resulted in 717 applicants reaching a satisfactory standard and these were deemed qualified. The NCC and <Col N="367" /> the CAO very much regret the error which occurred during the initial offer of places to mature applicants. In round one, approximately 200 applicants who had scored lowest in the application process, were erroneously offered preferential places. The error was discovered immediately, and following joint discussions between the NCC and the CAO, it was decided firstly to honour the offers made in error, and secondly, to re-run the file to offer places to all those who were entitled to receive an offer. This ensured that no mature code applicant was disadvantaged due to the administrative error. The offer process will continue up until 17 October 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department was informed of the error immediately it was discovered, and An Bord Altranais has kept it fully up to date on developments. An Bord Altranais has assured my Department that the decisions taken by the NCC and the CAO in the management of the error were fair and just and sought to ensure that all those who were entitled to an offer received one. The number of places available for student nurse training in 2001 is 1,559. Some 1,045 places are available in general nursing, 314 places are available in psychiatric nursing and 200 places are available in mental handicap nursing. Each year, a quota of places in each of the three diploma programmes is specifically allocated for mature applicants. The approximate quota available for mature applicants in 2001 is 156 places in general nursing, 15%, 121 places in psychiatric nursing, 35%, and 70 places in mental handicap nursing 35%, a total of 347 places. As of 26 September 2001, 549 mature applicants have been offered a place with 482 accepting same. A total of 291 places have been accepted in general nursing, 35 above the original quota, 124 places in psychiatric nursing, three places above the quota, and 67 places in mental handicap nursing, three places less than the quota. As I mentioned earlier, the process of offering places to all applicants for nursing continues up until 17 October 2001, when the result of the last round of CAO offers will be known. An Bord Altranais and the admissions officers of the higher education institutions are continuing to monitor the situation closely. In the meantime, the Nursing Careers Centre is available to provide information for any applicant who wishes to have his or her position clarified.</P>

      <P>The HSEA has advised all employers of the eligibility of acting allowances for overtime calculation. In this regard the HSEA is in contact with the nursing unions regarding retrospection payments for current employees. It is proposed that pension adjustments will be processed on an application basis in respect of pensioners. With regard to the individual to whom the question refers, I have been informed by the South-Eastern Health Board that the revision of pension and lump sum has been completed, and that all outstanding arrears will be paid shortly. The Health Service Employers' Agency is currently in discussion with the relevant parties regarding the broader issue of when the directive will be applied to other retired nursing staff. I have been advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that it is currently looking at the necessary software changes to the payroll/superannuation system to implement the revised ruling on a current basis.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million, 2.971 million this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million, 2.044 million was for the orthodontic initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services. Two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed. The first has been assigned to the East Coast Area Health Board and the second has been appointed to the South-Western Area Health Board. The recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is currently in train. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more. The recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed and the successful candidates have taken up their duties. Interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future. A competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the East Coast Area Health Board has been completed and the recruitment of the successful candidate is currently in train. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future. The previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James's Hospital has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a permanent basis. A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed, is now open and treatment of patients there has commenced. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed and it will be operational in the near future. The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. Validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress. Agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists for the ERHA will commence training in 2001.</P>

      <P>Under Section 36(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, the Information Commissioner has recently carried out an investigation into the practices and procedures adopted by public bodies for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of the Act generally. My Department was one of the public bodies selected for inclusion in the investigation and co-operated fully with the Office of the Information Commissioner in this regard. The volume of FOI requests received by my Department on a yearly basis has grown steadily since commencement, with a total of 452 requests received in the year 2000 and in excess of 477 requests received this year to date. While the Act reflects best administrative practice, difficulties have been encountered in meeting the statutory deadlines.</P>
      <P>The Information Commissioner's Report recommended that the Department review its procedures for dealing with requests under the Freedom of Information Act and take early action to address the deficiencies identified. These deficiencies relate to delays in meeting statutory deadlines, advising on rights of appeal, liaising with the Information Commissioners Office on cases under review. While there is still a backlog of requests, the Department has assigned additional resources to the freedom of information unit and adopted new procedures for the processing of requests. A program of training is planned for the newly assigned staff together with the panel of internal reviewers. The manner of advising requesters of their rights of appeal is now consistent with that advised by the Information Commissioner. There are a growing numbers of requests for personal records from adults who were in residential or foster care as children. The Department has consulted the National Archives and the Department of Education on the indexing of relevant files. It is intended to introduce standard arrangements for processing such requests in the future. In reviewing the operation of the Act, the Department's priorities would reflect the main recommendations of the Information Commissioner. These include the development of expertise, appropriate use of exemptions, records management initiatives, and the release of information routinely without recourse to the Act.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council is the independent body, established under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to ensure the highest standards of patient care by medical practitioners in Ireland. Under this Act, the Medical Council has a statutory responsibility to regulate provisional, full and temporary registration. In order to maintain these standards the Medical Council has notified all hospitals in Ireland of new guidelines relating to the appointment of temporarily registered doctors wishing to register as locum/temporary consultants. The Medical Council has indicated that, from 1 July 2001, temporarily registered doctors wishing to register as locum/temporary consultants are required to possess the standard of training and experience set out by the relevant specialist training body. The council has indicated that NCHDs may act up for brief periods of time, for example, holiday and study leave cover, as long as this acting up occurs in the hospitals for which the doctors are registered and so long as they have available to them the advice of a fully trained consultant in the relevant speciality. The Medical Council, in recognition of difficulties which may be encountered by hospitals in obtaining cover, has indicated that, in certain cases and subject to certain criteria and prior approval being sought from the Council, the implementation date for these guidelines will be extended to 1 January 2002.</P>

Project teams have been established in respect of the proposed units in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick and design briefs are being prepared. In addition, a sub-group of the working group has been established to examine the service needs of persons between 16 and 18 years of age.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423 and 463 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce <Col N="376" /> requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015 was published on 25 July last. The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years comprising a doubling in the number of physiotherapists, an increase of over 150% in occupational therapists and a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and 25 course places for physiotherapy. Other key recommendations of the report include provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators, the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system, a concerted recruitment from overseas, the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service and a career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority &ndash; HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

This payment incorpor<Col N="377" /> ates the orphan's pension and allowances payments. The new scheme was introduced as a result of the recommendations made in the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care A Child Centred Partnership. The report recommended that discretionary payments, made by health boards to foster carers be abolished, and that the allowances be increased to the new rates. The report further recommended, in view of the new allowances, that orphans' pensions and allowances should not be paid in respect of children in foster care. It was not possible to implement the new scheme exactly in the manner set out in the report. The new scheme, however, is designed to achieve the report's objective which is to provide foster carers with an adequate allowance to look after their foster children. It should be noted that prior to 1 August the orphan's allowance/pension was paid in respect of a minority of children in foster care. The revised arrangements will ensure that all children in foster care are treated equally. The recommendations regarding allowances are only part of a much wider set of recommendations designed to ensure that the structures and services necessary to meet the needs of children in foster care, their families and foster carers will be strengthened and further developed. The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the report on a phased basis and, as part of that commitment, in addition to introducing the new allowances, has already established the working group to draw up national standards on practices and procedures in foster care, as recommended in the report. The implementation of the report's recommendations reflects the Government's overall commitment to strengthen and further develop the child welfare and protection services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, the transition from the traditional apprenticeship model of nursing training to the revised diploma model was completed in all three pre-registration nursing disciplines, general, mental handicap and psychiatric nursing. The current training programme is operated by schools of nursing in association with third level institutions. Successful completion of the three year nursing registration/diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais and the award of a Diploma in Nursing Studies from the linked third level institution.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the change from the traditional apprenticeship model of nurse training to the nursing diploma programme means that nursing students are supernumerary to the workforce and no longer receive a salary, except for a fourteen-week period during the third year of training when they are rostered for work. However, nursing students on the diploma programmes receive a substantial financial support package, including an annual non-means tested maintenance grant of £3,570, 4,532.96. The value of this grant is almost double the rate of the maximum means-tested higher education grant payable to other third level students. This is in recognition of the 48 week commitment that nursing students are required to give to theoretical instruction and clinical instruction during each of the three years of the programme. Nursing students commencing the diploma programme also benefit from a book allowance of £270, 342.83, along with a uniform allowance of £170, 215.85. Nursing students are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven-day per week basis in designated health institutions. Students undertaking external clinical placements receive an allowance of £40 or 50.79 per week in cases where it is necessary for the students to find alternative accommodation away from their normal place of residence for the duration of the placement. Students undertaking external clinical placements also receive a weekly travel pass. Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf. The average annual fee is about £1,700, 2,158.55. The average annual total value of these supports is some £7,000 or 8,888.17 per nursing student, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing, which reported in 1998, recommended that pre-registration nursing education should move to a four-year degree programme in time for the intake of nursing students in 2002. The commission also recommended that pre-registration nursing education should be incorporated into the third level education sector with education modules being organised around academic semesters. This would allow nursing students to become more like other third level students with similar holiday periods. In such a scenario, the commission considered that the cur<Col N="379" /> rent non-means tested grant payable to nursing students would no longer be tenable. The commission accordingly recommended that the nursing student grant and any student benefits should be the same as those available to other third level students and be means-tested. All of the funding issues associated with the implementation of these recommendations are currently being considered by an interdepartmental steering committee. This committee is composed of representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Finance and the Higher Education Authority. I expect to be in a position in the near future to bring proposals before Government for the implementation of a nursing degree programme along the lines of the Commission on Nursing's recommendations.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to provide funding, as part of a major investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures in acute hospitals, for the recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants in each health board region. An additional two accident and emergency consultants were approved to serve the North-Eastern Health Board region. Following consideration by Comhairle na nOspidéal, it was determined that these appointments would be based at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and provide outreach services to the other general hospitals, including Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, in the region in line with service needs. The recruitment of these additional personnel, initially on a temporary basis, is being progressed by the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I should also advise the Deputy that Comhairle na nOspidéal is in the process of reviewing the structure, operation and staffing of A&amp;E services with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. The findings of this review will inform future policy decisions in relation to the provision of A&amp;E services, including the appointment on a permanent basis of additional consultants to the North-Eastern Health Board region. I am advised that the review is at an advanced stage and I look forward to receiving the findings in the near future.</P>
      <P>The provision and development of orthopaedic services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. In this regard, I am advised that the board in line with a key proposal in its framework document, North East Hospitals &ndash; The Next Five Years &ndash; a framework for continuing development, is developing the hospital as the regional orthopaedic centre with appropriate staff and other resources being made available to it. In this capacity the hospital will provide all single system orthopaedic surgical procedures, in other words knee and hip operations, and such like, and all elective procedures. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, has the largest concentration of consultant, nursing and paramedical staff in the region. Because of the skills and range of medical expertise available to it, it is being designated by the board as the centre for the care and treatment of persons with multiple system injuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 428 and 429 together.</P>
      <P>Waiting times for assessment for intercountry adoption in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, have been a source of concern to me since I took up office. I am very conscious of the need to reduce time spent by couples on waiting lists for such assessments. The number of applications for assessment has been increasing steadily over the last five years. A standardised framework for intercountry adoption assessment procedures is now being used in all health boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes so that resources are used effectively and to provide a transparent system that can be understood by all of the parties. The framework has been welcomed by both health boards and couples. Over the past three years I have allocated additional funding of over £550,000, or 698,356, aimed at reducing time spent on waiting lists by couples awaiting intercountry adoption assessment in the ERHA.</P>
      <P>I understand from the ERHA that the additional funding it received has enabled a number of initiatives to take place that were aimed at reducing the projected waiting time for assessment. These initiatives have included the introduction of a one-stop-shop facility to increase capacity for holding office based interviews and reduce the time that social workers spend travelling to and from client visits. The assignment of new administrative personnel in 2000 to provide support for social workers with regard to administrative tasks. This has freed social workers to concentrate on assessments, post placement reports and other appropriate work. At the end of June 2001, the ERHA indicated that the projected waiting time for assessments was 18 months. However, over the past few months the number of social workers working in the service has reduced due to resignations and it is reasonable to assume that this has had a negative impact on waiting times.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been ongoing with the ERHA on further measures to address the problem. The authority has now decided that new units will be established in the Northern and East Coast Area Health Boards and that the present service will become the unit for the South-Western Health Board. The arrangements for devolving this service are currently under negotiation with all three area health boards with the intention of having the new services fully operational by March 2002. The existing service in the South-Western Health Board will continue to work its way through the list as before until the new services are set up. I understand that applicants will be kept informed of new developments in the service as they occur and of the progress of their application.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry collates data on the incidence of and mortality from cancer in this country. I have been informed by the registry that it is not possible to confirm precisely the number of mesothelioma related cancer deaths in Ireland, as this level of morphological detail is not normally recorded on a death certificate. However, what is known is that most cases of mesothelioma occur in the pleura, the serious membranes lining the thorax and the lungs and most tumours arising from the pleura are the result of occupational asbestos exposure. The following is a table with a breakdown of the official number of combined deaths from malignant neoplasm of the pleura (ICD9 163) and asbestosis (ICD9 501) in the State between 1994 and 1998, the latest years for which the most accurate mortality data are available.</P>

      <P>In addition a copy of the file compiled by the Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination which relates to the person referred to by the Deputy has recently been provided to the family's solicitors at their request.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board &ndash; NEHB &ndash; that there are currently 416 patients in the Louth-Monaghan area and 280 patients in the Meath-Cavan area on their orthodontic waiting lists; this is a total of 696 patients on the board's waiting list. The average waiting time for treatment is approximately 24 months. There were 1,719 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board as at the end of June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Follow<Col N="385" /> ing this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £0.440 million (0.558 million) has been approved for orthodontic services this year in the NEHB, of which £0.090 million (0.114 million) was for its orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board propose to undertake additional sessions by its staff.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been reached between the NEHB and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. One dentist from the board will commence training in October 2001. A dentist from the board is currently in specialist training for orthodontics in Belfast.</P>
    <P>In addition my Department has funded the development of regional orthodontic units in Navan and Dundalk both of which are now operational.</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter services of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service fall to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement other pre-hospital services such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency schemes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Good Friday Agreement a number of areas were identified where North/South co-operation might be developed or enhanced. One of the working groups established to examine the area of planning for major emergencies &ndash; the Cross Border Working Group on Pre-Hospital Emergency Care &ndash; has proposed the commissioning of a feasibility study on an all-island helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS). Terms of reference have been drafted and it is expected that the process of inviting tenders from consultants to undertake the study will commence shortly. Funding for the study will be met jointly by my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service in 1993 approximately £45 million has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations with well over half of this funding being provided by this Government.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the report of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group, Building Healthier Hearts.</P>

      <P>In Cork University Hospital there were 19 patients who were medically discharged but were awaiting alternative placement. Of this number, four patients were awaiting admission to a community hospital. There were three patients in Tralee General Hospital who were inappropriately placed.

There were no patients in Bantry General Hospital that were inappropriately placed.</P>
      <P>The waiting list for admission to community hospitals as at 11 June 2001 was 258. This number would have included patients who were resident in nursing homes who wished to transfer to community hospitals.</P>
      <P>On the basis of cases at that time, the average cost of each enhanced subvention was £260 (euro equivalent: 330.13) per week per applicant.</P>

      <P>Any investigative tests prescribed by a general practitioner as part of a curative treatment protocol for patients are provided free of charge for medical card patients, however preventative screening is not. Phase I of a cervical screening programme was launched in the Mid-Western Health Board area which is providing a free screening service to all females between the age of 25 and 50 years. Patients are being alerted to the existence of the scheme by the health board and invited to attend their general practitioner for the test. This scheme will eventually be available on a nationwide basis.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the drugs payments scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and it is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and significantly to improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>Policy in relation to eligibility for health services will be outlined in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>The Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) was established, on an administrative basis, in April 1999.

The question of inclusion of non-health board facilities within the remit of the SSI is one of the issues which will be examined in preparing the new legislation.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Nursing recognised the need for a coherent approach to the progression of specialisation and development of a clinical career pathway in nursing and midwifery. This function is vested in the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery. The national council has issued clear guidelines to all health service providers on the process by which clinical nurse or midwife <Col N="396" /> specialist posts should be developed. I am arranging for a copy of these guidelines to be sent to the Deputy for his information.</P>
      <P>The national council is working closely with the regional nursing and midwifery planning and development units, which have responsibility for the strategic planning of nursing and midwifery services in a health board area, to encourage the development of specialist posts based on identified service and patient needs. Part of the process set out in the national council's guidelines involves the health service provider submitting a plan for the development of any such posts to the relevant nursing and midwifery planning unit for consideration.</P>
      <P>The submission from the Diabetes Federation of Ireland was referred to the national council for attention in June 2000, and I have been informed by the national council that 45 clinical nurse specialist diabetes posts have been confirmed by it to date.</P>

      <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable £90, £120, £150 &ndash; euro equivalent: 114.28, 152.37, 190.46, respectively &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. I remind the Deputy that the new rates, which represent a 25% increase, were introduced on 1 April last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that considerable improvements have been made in recent years in the area of paediatric hospital services. In 2000 a total of 83,000 children aged 0-14 years were treated as in-patients in public hospitals. A further 28,000 day cases were treated. The total number of children treated annually between 1996 and 2000 has been maintained despite a reduction in the number of children in the population from 860,000 in 1996 to 824,000 in 2000. The rate of treatment has therefore increased over the period.</P>
      <P>In the area of waiting lists the total number of children on public hospital waiting lists in target specialties in June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was 2,857. This figure represents a decrease of 583 or 17% on the comparable figure for June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no child waits longer than six months for treatment. Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists and waiting times in target specialties for children. <Col N="399" /> For example, between June 2000 and June 2001, the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by</P>
    <P>85%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by</P>
    <P>31%, and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 25%. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to report that considerable progress has been made in improving the infrastructure in paediatric hospitals. In addition to the relocation of the National Children's Hospital at the new hospital in Tallaght, my Department has funded a range of developments to further enhance paediatric services. In this regard I was pleased to recently open a new day ward and casualty department at Temple Street Children's Hospital. The development of the two units was funded by my Department at a cost of £2.7million &ndash; 3.43 million. The Deputy will also be aware that within five to seven years the hospital will relocate to the Mater Hospital campus as part of a major development programme approved for the site.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has sanctioned a major theatre development at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. This development, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area incorporating two day theatre suites and a central sterile supplies department. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. The necessary planning for this work is now at an advanced stage. The next step will be to seek tenders for the work with commencement of construction to follow shortly thereafter. I also recently announced the provision of a capital grant of £3 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the provision and replacement of urgent priority equipment and minor capital works at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. I am satisfied that the range of measures described above will facilitate the enhancement of paediatric services for children at specialist hospitals.</P>

Universal cardiac check ups for children are not provided in other countries with similar patterns of heart disease to those in Ireland, International developments in knowledge of potentially serious cardiac conditions in children will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the issue of child health was the subject of a report, Best Health for Children, initiated by the chief executive officers of the health boards. This report promotes an evidence based approach to child health with the primary aim of ensuring the early detection of potentially serious diseases, with a view to improving outcomes in the health of children and greater integration between primary, secondary and community care services. It also outlines a core programme for child health surveillance and recommends a total of nine developmental health checks to be carried out by GPs and public health nurses for children age seven and under. A national conjoint child health committee is currently overseeing the implementation of the recommendations. A sum of £800,000 &ndash; 1,015,790 &ndash; was allocated this year to allow the boards to commence the implementation of these recommendations. This funding has in the main been used to employ child health development officers who will drive the implementation process at local level and to start a number of dem<Col N="401" /> onstration projects, for example, the piloting of a school health service project in the North</P>

    <P>The board has advised that within the context of its overall development plans a further £67 million approximately would be required to <Col N="405" /> develop both community and hospital based services for older people. The Government provided considerable additional revenue resources in 2001 in respect of services for older people and the need to further develop residential and community facilities for older people will continue to be given priority. In this connection, a new health strategy is being prepared by my Department which will encompass a number of specific areas for priority service development, including services for older people. My Department will continue to liaise with the South-Eastern Health Board in relation to progressing the board's development plan for services for older people within the context of the national development plan and the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. In addition, persons aged 70 and over are automatically eligible for medical cards.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health <Col N="409" /> strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department has written to the chief executive officers of all health boards asking them to ensure that medical card holders who have entered, or will enter, private nursing homes retain their eligibility for incontinence wear under the medical card scheme. The boards have been asked to put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure that all medical card holders in receipt of a subvention be supplied with incontinence wear on the same basis as if they were residing in the community.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority has informed me that to date, the authority has underlined the reduction of the category I assessment waiting list, which is comprised entirely of high priority cases and dealt with on a priority basis. The category I assessment waiting list has been significantly reduced to 16 cases as at August 2001. The chief executive officer has also informed me that the next main priority of its orthodontic service will be the reduction of the category II assessment waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> I am concerned that the waiting times for orthodontic services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, are unacceptably long. However, the chief executive officer of the authority has informed me that under the orthodontic initiative, steps have been taken to address the situation and progress has been made on a</P>
    <P>number of developments.</P>
    <P>Two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed. The first has been assigned to the East Coast Area Health Board and the second has been appointed to the South-Western Area Health Board. These appointments will, <i>inter alia</i>, immediately increase the number of patients assessed for orthodontic treatment in the authority.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is currently in train. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more. The recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed and the successful candidates have taken up their duties.</P>
    <P>Interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future.</P>
    <P>A competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the East Coast Area Health Board has been completed and the recruitment of the successful candidate is currently in train. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future.</P>
    <P>The previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James's hospital unit has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced.</P>
    <P>The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's hospital orthodontic unit is being completed and it will be operational in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital; meanwhile, the board proposes to acquire suitable accommodation for its orthodontic service. In addition, services will continue to be provided by the regional orthodontic unit at St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress. I am further informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that at the end of the June 2001 quarter, there were 3,297 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority. In <Col N="411" /> addition, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. Agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics and four dentists for the ERHA will commence training this month.</P>
    <P>Overall, this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists. The authority has advised me that the ultimate effect of their proposals when fully implemented, will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 3,000 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. The outcome of this initiative in conjunction with the structural changes will be carefully monitored to assess the impact on waiting lists and to determine what further resources, if any, are required.</P>

The significant increases in the numbers of staff recruited, coupled with the very competitive labour market over this period, have driven the increase in recruitment costs outlined in the table.</P>

      <P>The motorised transport grant is a means tested payment administered by the health boards. It was introduced in 1968 by way of Circular 7/68. The guidelines were reviewed and modified in letters of 19 February 1974 and 15 March 1974. The purpose of this allowance is to provide assistance to persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain/retain employment or to provide assistance to persons with a disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the person to obtain/retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
      <P>Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and, therefore, they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases, the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who will drive this person to and from his/her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board. The maximum grant is £3,300, effective from 1 April 2001.</P>
      <P>A total of 296 people received the motorised transport grant in 2000. The total expenditure for this grant for the year ended 31 December 2000 was £935,199.</P>

      <P>Arising from concerns about the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice in the past, the chief medical officer, CMO, at my Department asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its comments and advice on the matter.</P>
      <P>The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the specialty and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute has replied to the CMO and confirms that from around 1920 until around 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients, mainly in the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Hospital. Excellent results were claimed for this procedure, which had the effect of permanently enlarging the pelvis and allowing women to undergo normal <Col N="416" /> delivery. This was at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis. Sepsis was one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time. The institute states that, in properly conducted cases, complications were rare. Published medical reports of the time indicate favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.</P>
    <P>The institute states that from 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was replaced by the modern caesarean section. Antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that we must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made since the 1950s and 1960s and medical care and procedures were not as advanced then as they are in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>Statistics on the number of women who underwent a symphysiotomy in the National Maternity Hospital are not available in my Department. However, I have asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to take up this matter with the National Maternity Hospital and to reply directly to the Deputy. I have also asked the ERHA to establish when the use of symphysiotomy in obstetric practice ceased at the National Maternity Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any compensation claims to date in respect of women who underwent a symphysiotomy in Ireland.</P>

The Medical Defence Union has attributed the scale of this increase to the size of awards and settlements made in cases involving brain-damaged infants. I am concerned that such an enormous increase has been proposed but I am satisfied that in itself it has no major implications for the delivery of obstetric services in Ireland as cover remains available from the other mutual defence body, the Medical Protection Society at a rate of £52,000, 66,026.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The settling of appropriate subscription rates for medical indemnity cover is a matter for the medical defence bodies. The Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society are mutual defence bodies responsible to their own members. In recent months they have both explained the basis on which they arrived at their respective rates for covering Irish obstetricians. These appear to be influenced by differential claims experiences, different approaches to reserving to meet the cost of future claims and to the degree to which each attempts to allocate the cost of meeting obstetric claims across other specialties. Increases in the cost of providing cover for obstetrics highlights the difficulties inherent in the present indemnity arrangements. These are not confined to this specialty. I hope to be in a position to take further more detailed proposals on the introduction of enterprise liability to Government in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The group established to examine the feasibility of introducing a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation system for infants who suffer brain damage at birth has begun its work and hopes to be in a position to submit at least an interim report on its deliberations in the middle of next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 523, 536, 545, 546, 547 and 627 together.</P>
      <P>I have provided a sum of £1 million this year to the Western Health Board for the development of symptomatic breast disease services in line with the recommendations of the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. The board has formulated detailed proposals on the development of services in its functional area. These proposals are the subject of ongoing consultations between the board and my Department.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000. Phase I of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. It is my intention that phase II of the programme, which will involve the extension of BreastCheck nationwide, should follow phase I as soon as is practicably possible. I understand that planning meetings have been held between the national breast screening board and the health boards concerning the roll out of phase II of the programme. My Department will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to national coverage as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Certificates required by employers to cover the absence of their employees due to illness are the only certificates covered under the medical card scheme. It is not my intention to extend the list of services available to persons aged 70 years and over, or indeed to any other category of medical card holder, to include the cost of the certificate required when applying for a driving licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has complied with the recommendations set out in the national changeover plan in that we accept and make payments, on request, in euro.</P>
      <P>Our current task is to ensure that the Department and agencies under the Department's aegis are fully euro compliant by 1 January 2002. Two groups were established in order to ensure the smooth transition to the single currency in the health services, the departmental euro changeover group and the health services euro changeover group. The former dealt with the changeover within the Department while the latter was established in order to oversee the transition throughout the wider health service sector.</P>
      <P>To date the Department's changeover has been successful with the payroll system scheduled to begin operating in euro from mid-October. Testing is continuing on the FMS, accounting, system which will be converted to euro on 1 January 2002. All other IT systems within the Department will be euro compliant by 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The training programme for the Department will commence in mid-October and will consist of seminars for general information purposes. Front-line staff, that is, those in finance and accounting areas have benefited from ongoing training associated with the implementation of the new systems.</P>
      <P>Every month there is a meeting of the health services euro changeover group. One of the functions of the group is allow the Department to monitor the state of preparedness in the health services as a whole. The group also acts as a forum to allow boards to highlight problems and to facilitate a common approach to the euro within the health services. We can report that the boards and the wider health services are on schedule with their changeover plans.</P>
      <P>In regard to general issues, the Department reports to the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland each month. This includes a letter signed by the Secretary General outlining the current status of departmental plans. A memorandum is produced by the board which contains a summary of the preparations of each Department and is submitted to Government.</P>
      <P>The Scot officer or his deputy from the Department attends monthly meetings in the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. Similar to the health services euro changeover group, this group is used for information purposes and as a method of monitoring preparations across the public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> The Scot officer is part of a Euro Changeover Board of Ireland initiative for the education of low awareness groups. This group was established in order to target clients who may, through their circumstances, be unable to avail of the standard information on the euro. The issue of low awareness is a permanent item on the agenda of the health services euro changeover group. The boards have endeavoured to inform these clients through the various hospitals and community care areas under their aegis.</P>
    <P>In reply to the second part of the question, I have asked my Department to arrange that, except where the context clearly requires otherwise, between now and 1 January 2002 and for a reasonable period thereafter, all monetary values in replies to parliamentary questions will be shown in euro and Irish pounds.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply of 1 May 2001, my role and responsibility in this area relates to the implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and provide for notification to, and inspection by, health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my replies of 1 May, 22 May and 21 June 2001 that the North Western Health Board is assisting the proprietor of this crèche in acquiring suitable alternative accommodation. I understand from the North Western Health Board that options for sourcing a suitable premises and funding options are still being actively pursued by the board. The board has advised that it will continue to make all efforts to resolve this matter as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board communicated with the Deputy regarding this matter on 7 August 2001 and I have asked the chief executive officer of the North Western Health Board to communicate further with the Deputy when this issue is resolved.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of state support, the National Sudden Infant Death Register was established in 1992 as part of an ongoing liaison between my Department and the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association. The register aims to identify and categorise all deaths in children from birth to two years of age and to establish the incidence and causes of mortality. My Department has funded the register since its foundation in 1992 and from 1999 a sum of £160,000 per annum has been assigned to the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association towards the cost of the register and its related research and service</P>
      <P>budgets. It is universally accepted that the database of information that has built up since the establishment of the register is an important resource in the campaign to lower the incidence of this syndrome.</P>

      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are shown in the following tabular statement. These figures have been extracted from the annual financial statements of the health boards. The 2000 figures for all health boards including the Eastern Regional Health Authority are unaudited. However, it is unlikely that these figures will change significantly on audit.</P>
      <P>The grade category of management/ administration also includes staff who are of direct service to patients, such as consultants, secretaries, community welfare officers, out-patient department personnel, ward clerks, medical records personnel and telephonists who are engaged in front-line duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that the purpose of many of the staff classified as management/ administration is to support front-line professionals in carrying out their duties more efficiently. Health professionals, especially consultants and nurse managers, require clerical support and request such appointments on an ongoing basis. The strengthening of the accountability of health boards in the context of the accountability legislation of 1996 has led to the strengthening of the finance function in health <Col N="424" /> boards and in the development of the service planning and evaluation function. In addition, improvements in risk management, human resource management and health and safety practices have contributed to a growth in the management/administrative area.</P>

      <P>The report concerned relates to allegations made in the <i>Irish Independent </i>on 28 and 29 June last that Irish children had been administered the animal vaccine Tribovax T instead of the human vaccine, Trivax, during the early 1970s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> Following the publication of these allegations in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, I requested a full investigation into the matters raised. On foot of this request, a preliminary report from GlaxoSmithKline was submitted to my Department in early July and a further report was received from the company at the end of July. Senior representatives from GlaxoSmithKline recently met with my officials to discuss the company's final report which concludes that GSK does not believe it possible that Tribovax T was administered in error to any child in the early 1970s and that a simple recording error is the most likely explanation. A copy of the company's report has been issued to the Deputy with this reply.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the alleged administration of the animal vaccine took place almost 30 years ago and the difficulties this has caused in terms of investigating the issue, officials in my Department have satisfied themselves that, on the basis of all currently available information, the most likely explanation is that the health professionals involved at the time may have made simple handwritten errors in transcribing the lot number from the vaccine vial to the individual vaccine record cards. Having separately considered these issues, this is also the view of the Irish Medicines Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. On the basis of this advice, I am satisfied that the relevant agencies and the company concerned have been as thorough as possible in their investigations and that the conclusion that a simple transcription error may have taken place is credible and is indeed the most probable explanation under the circumstances.</P>

This was to replace the existing diphtheria, tetanus and whole-cell pertussis vaccine which had been in use up to then. My Department has written to the health boards asking them to confirm that on receipt of the Department's advice, the use of whole-cell pertussis vaccine ceased and was replaced by the acellular product. I will communicate again with the Deputy when all of the health board's responses have been received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in County Wicklow is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed and the recruitment of a fourth consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is in train. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and three managers have <Col N="428" /> been appointed to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards. A six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently providing treatment to eligible persons in the East Coast Area Health Board. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed and will be operational in the near future. The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
    <P>In addition, agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics and four dentists for the authority will commence training in 2001. Validation of waiting lists is currently in progress.</P>
    <P>I have again asked the chief executive officer of the authority to investigate the position in relation to this case and to reply to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Section 2 states, &ldquo;In calculating the means of a person in respect of whom a subvention has been sought, a health board shall take all sources of income into account, including wages, salary, pension, allowances, payments for part time and seasonal work, income from rentals, investments and savings and all contributions from whomsoever arising.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 7 states, &ldquo;A health board may consider any asset of the person in respect of whom a subvention has been sought as a source of funding for nursing home care&rdquo;.

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of hospital services at Louth County Hospital, Dundalk rests with the North Eastern Health Board. I have had inquires made of the board and have been advised that a proposal to establish a renal dialysis unit in Louth County Hospital, Dundalk, is under active consideration by the board. The proposal is being progressed in conjunction with hospital management in Daisyhill Hospital, Newry, County Down, and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. Both of these hospitals provide dialysis services for renal patients resident in the Dundalk area. The proposed development of a dialysis unit at Dundalk Hospital is in line with the North Eastern Health Board's policy of increasing capacity in the region and thereby reducing the need for patients to travel outside their catchment area for treatment.</P>
      <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to outline to the Deputy the policy position in relation to the wider development of renal services. I have identified renal services as one of the main acute hospital priorities for development. In this regard, I was pleased to provide additional funding of over £9 million over the last two years to increase capacity in this area.</P>
      <P>I accept the need for further investment in the development of this important service. As a consequence, I will shortly be establishing a group to formulate a national strategy for renal services and to develop a framework for future service delivery which will build on the current investment programme.</P>

      <P>Arrangements are currently being made to commence certain sections of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001. Other sections, including those relating to risk equalisation and lifetime community rating, will be commenced in due course. Regarding the implementation of some provisions of the Act, I would point out that proposed regulations to be made thereunder require affirmation by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the passing of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the introduction of the related regulations in March 1996, there has been a legal requirement for private health insurance companies to offer insurance cover on the basis of community rating, lifetime cover and open enrolment. That Act also provided for the introduction of a risk equalisation scheme among insurers operating in the market. The 2001 Act retains and enhances the provisions of the 1994 Act in <Col N="432" /> relation to the application of community rating. The regulations to be introduced relating to risk equalisation and lifetime community rating will support the continuation of community rating.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our obligations under EU law, proportionality is required in relation to measures to protect the common good in the conduct of health insurance business. In this connection, the proposed risk equalisation scheme, which will incorporate a significant role for the independent statutory Health Insurance Authority in relation to any commencement of transfers and the level of same, will have regard to the application of community rating across the market and facilitating competition among insurers. As regards the impact on private health insurers, the legislation will provide an appropriate regulatory framework, intended to strike an effective balance between the facilitation of competition and the maintenance of core principles which characterise the operation of voluntary private health insurance here.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 559, 560 and 602 together.</P>
      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was compiled by management consultants who were commissioned by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service IBTS to review the implementation of the reorganisation plan which was adopted by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service some time ago. I have not received a copy of the consultant's report as, based on legal advice, the board has decided that it cannot release the report. I have, however, received a copy of the consultants' recommendations which recognise that there is a desire and commitment in the organisation to provide the highest quality service, supply and safety to the Irish public. The consultants note that much has been accomplished to place the service on a stable footing and personnel in the organisation have worked strenuously to address past difficulties. The recommendations, which have been accepted by the board, identify further development work which is necessary to continue to meet the demands of a modern transfusion service. The primary recommendation refers to the need for a comprehensive programme of organisation development and change management to be led by the executive encompassing all parts of the organisation. I understand the board has commenced the implementation of the recommendations based on the principles and practices of change management. The board has established a sub-committee to progress its change management programme as a matter of priority. I very much welcome this initiative by the board which is an important additional element in the re-organisation of the service to ensure that it continues to respond effectively to the rapidly changing environment in transfusion medicine.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the role and contribution of any part of the service to the achievement of national goals and objectives are a matter for the board of the IBTS. The future role and contribution of the Cork centre is being addressed as part of the preparation of a development brief for a new centre in Cork. A project team, established by the board, is expected to complete a design brief for consideration by the board in a matter of weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 561, 599, 600 and 610 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, in April this year, published the report of the forum on medical manpower and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and also approved the establishment of a national task force on medical manpower to prepare a detailed implementation programme for the phased reduction of the working hours of NCHDs, required under the EU working time directive &ndash; Council Directive 93/104/EC and 2000/34/EC. The Government also decided that it would consider the proposed development of a consultant-delivered public hospital service following quantification of the resource and cost implications involved.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department, in consultation with Mr. David Hanly, independent chairperson of the national task force on medical manpower, have been working on the draft terms of reference and working structures of the task force over the summer months, and it is envisaged that the task force will hold its inaugural meeting shortly.</P>
      <P>There is no proposal to establish a 94-person task force. What is proposed is the establishment of a steering group to co-ordinate the work of the task force and to oversee the work of three project groups which will address non-consultant hospital doctor working hours; resource and cost quantification; and medical education and training implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> The steering group and the project groups are likely to have approximately 20 to 25 members each. While overall membership of the task force will be somewhat large, numbering some 70 individuals in total, this is necessary given the importance of the issues involved, both to provide appropriate representation to all the relevant stakeholders and to facilitate rapid progress through a structure of project groups which will work on a programme of priority issues in a parallel format. I am confident that this approach is the most appropriate and will yield rapid results.</P>
    <P>I am aware, however, of certain reservations in this regard and I will consider these before reaching a final decision on the most appropriate structures for the task force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1999, my Department asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. The NDSC has given detailed consideration to these issues and has drawn up a Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland, SARI, which I launched on 19 June this year. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance. These can be grouped into four categories, as follows: surveillance of resistance and antibiotic use; hygiene and prevention of infection; judicious use of antibiotics in hospitals and the community; and education of health care workers, patients and the general public.</P>
      <P>Tackling the problem of antimicrobial resistance is a multi-faceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. A three tier structure at local, regional and national level is proposed in this regard. Implementation of the strategy will take place on a phased basis over the next two to three years.</P>
      <P>As a first step, £2 million has been provided in the current year to the health boards for antimicrobial resistance measures, taking into account the recommendations in SARI and in the North-South study of MRSA in Ireland 1999. The boards have been asked to address in particular infection control strategies and staffing in both hospitals and the community, the development of surveillance systems for the collection of antimicrobial resistance data and information on antibiotic prescribing in hospitals. In addition, funding has been provided for the establishment of an MRSA reference laboratory at St. James's Hospital in Dublin.</P>

      <P>It is envisaged that from the beginning of 2002 there will be a change in the traditional method of funding of the Cork voluntary hospitals. These hospitals will no longer be funded directly from the Department of Health and Children but through the Southern Health Board. The report of the top level steering group on acute hospital services in Cork, set up to advise on a new model for funding, planning and management of hospital services in Cork city, was published on 26 July 2001. The report makes detailed recommendations about inter-hospital structures in order to ensure the provision of &ldquo;a single service from multiple sites&rdquo; in Cork. These recommendations envisage that overall planning issues of a strategic nature will be dealt with by an acute hospitals planning forum and the operational requirements of annual service planning will be dealt with by a service planning group. Intra-hospital structures will also be put in place to ensure that the needs of the voluntary hospitals are catered for in the service planning process.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is currently under review. The review being carried out takes into consideration various developments in the medical field and the role of the Medical Council. The revised Medical Practitioners Act will take account of the concerns raised by various interest groups.</P>

      <P>I have received the evaluation report of the two pilot projects in the North Eastern and South Eastern Health Boards and in a press release dated 24 September I mentioned that I saw the development of general practice out of hours co-operatives as one way of meeting the need for appropriate out of hours care for patients at night, weekends and on public holidays. I highlighted this as an excellent example of what can be achieved through a partnership approach between the Department, health boards and general practitioners. I also drew attention to the fact that issues had been raised in the report which need to be resolved before the co-op model can be rolled out nationally.</P>

      <P>The issue of the prescribing of medicines for patients, whether private or medical card holder, is an individual clinical decision taken by the general practitioner based on the symptoms of the presenting patient.</P>
      <P>I have not asked any person or organisation to provide any analysis on the lines suggested. However, a major review of the IDTS scheme was carried out in July 1997 by Professor Michael Murphy of University College, Cork, and one of his main conclusions was that there was no discernible negative effects on overall quality of prescribing by doctors participating in the IDTS scheme</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any person who feels he/she may have been treated less favourably by a prescribing GMS doctor when contrasted with a private patient, I would be most anxious that he forward the details to me for investigation and for appropriate action if this is deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>The issue of prescribing is one of many issues kept under ongoing review in consultations between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners. In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that funding is provided annually by my Department from the GP development fund to the National Pharmaconomics Centre at St. James's Hospital.</P>

The MRI facilities in Beaumont Hospital have been in service since 1993 while I provided £5.8 million in May 2000 for the provision of MRI facilities at the other three hospitals. In addition, MRI scanning services are available at a number of private hospitals which may be accessed by the public hospital system if required.</P>

The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is primarily focused on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review has taken account of Ireland's position with regard to hospital bed stock in comparison with EU member states and other developed countries.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the French health system is not seen as an appropriate model for Ireland due to its cost implications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22082/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In most developed countries, governments have significant involvement with both the financing and delivery of health care. By intervening in the market through both regulation and public ownership, governments are able to achieve social policy goals such as fairness and consumer protection. The model of health care that exists in France differs from the Irish model in a number of ways, particularly in regard to its method of financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The French health care system is based on a national universal compulsory insurance system linked to employment and financed by both employers and employees at roughly a 65:35 ratio. Funds cover pensions, family benefits and medical care. There is no competition between the sickness funds as they are organised strictly along occupational lines. Since the mid-1990s, the system has been the subject of a series of reforms <Col N="445" /> introduced to cover social security deficits, cost containment and longer term reforms. There has been a progressive widening of financing sources from payroll contributions towards general tax revenue. Currently, there are plans to finance an increasing proportion of collective health expenditure from a direct tax based largely on household incomes. The 1998 figures indicate that the public expenditure on health accounted for 7.2% of GNP in France as against about 5% in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In considering various funding systems in the context of the new national health strategy, the strategy consultative forum sub-group on funding concluded that because of spare capacity in the system, waiting lists are not a feature of the French system which is seen as particularly responsive. However, waiting list figures recently released for this country for the June 2001 quarter indicate that there have been significant reductions since June 2000 for target specialities: cardiac surgery down by 52%; gynaecology down by 35%; ENT down by 30%; ophthalmology down by 23%; orthopaedics down by 14%.</P>
    <P>Hospital waiting lists must be viewed against the background of a hospital system which discharged some 870,000 in-patients in 2000. The number of people currently on hospital in-patient waiting lists represents just 3% of all in-patient discharges in 2000.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy points out, in the World Health Organisation Report, 2000, France was assessed as being the best performer overall, with Ireland ranked as 19th out of 192 countries. It is worth noting, however, that Ireland ranked higher than France in the level of fairness with which people make contributions to health care finances.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that through the consultative forum for the national health strategy, a number of models of health care were examined, including social insurance. The results of their deliberations have informed the strategy which I intend bringing to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 583, 584 and 596 together.</P>
      <P>The Mental Health Act, 2001, provides for the establishment of an independent body, the Mental Health Commission, which will oversee the review of the detention process. It is hoped to appoint the members of the commission within the next few months.</P>
      <P>This Act is designed so that different commencement orders can be made for different parts of the Act. The first priority for the commission will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of the mental health tribunals. The commission will also need to ensure that all patients currently detained will have their cases reviewed by the tribunals within the first six months, as required by section 72 of the Act.</P>
      <P>Once the system of review has been successfully established, the commission will be expected to put in place the registration of approved centres, as provided for in Part V of the Act. Section 72 of the Act provides for the temporary registration of existing centres for three years, to allow the commission time to establish the new system. It is expected that the commission will be operational within the next few months and that reviews of detention will commence in early 2003. Registration of approved centres will be put in place by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>I acknowledged during the Oireachtas debates on this Act that there was a need for further legislation in the area of mental health and I indicated that my Department would be examining the issues involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981, were not brought into force for a number of reasons. The general thrust of the Act has been superseded by the developments in the psychiatric services, particularly since the publication of the report, Planning for the Future, in 1984 and its adoption as policy by successive Governments. In addition, developments in international law required different safeguards against improper detention than those provided for in the 1981 Act.</P>
      <P>The new Mental Health Act, 2001, significantly improves safeguards for involuntary patients in a more comprehensive way than did the 1981 Act and brings Irish mental health law in this area into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71, as amended by Regulation (EC) 2000/83, is the co-ordinating regulation covering the referral of patients abroad for benefits-in-kind, including hospital treatment. This regulation requires that patients seeking hospital treatment in an EU member state other <Col N="450" /> than their own seek prior authorisation from their competent institution &ndash; ERHA-health boards in Ireland's case &ndash; prior to receiving this treatment. The most recent European Court of Justice judgments in this area have not changed this position in that they reaffirm the necessity for a person seeking hospital treatment abroad to seek prior authorisation from the relevant health board prior to receiving this treatment.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that due to the specific nature of hospital services, member states should not be precluded from restricting the free movement of patients for the receipt of health care where such restrictions can be objectively justified. The &ldquo;risk of seriously undermining the financial balance of a social security system&rdquo;, &ldquo;the objective of maintaining a balanced medical and hospital service open to all&rdquo; and &ldquo;the maintenance of treatment capacity or medical competence on national territory&rdquo; are three such objective criteria set out by the European Court of Justice. However, the court has ruled that the granting of such an authorisation must be subject to the conditions that the treatment must be regarded as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in the professional circles concerned and the person's medical condition must require that treatment. In that regard, the court has also ruled that authorisation cannot be refused on the grounds of the treatment not being &ldquo;normal&rdquo; where it is considered that the treatment concerned is tried and tested by international science. In addition, authorisation can only be refused on the grounds of lack of medical necessity where similar or equally effective treatment can be obtained without undue delay in the person's member state.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that a scheme of prior authorisation must be based &ldquo;on objective, non-discretionary criteria which are known in advance, in such a way as to circumscribe the exercise of the national authorities' discretion, so that it is not used arbitrarily&rdquo;.  The Department issued directions some time ago outlining the objective criteria which health boards must consider prior to referring patients abroad for treatment.</P>
      <P>Referral of patients to countries outside the EU is outside the terms of Regulation (EC) 1408/71. Referrals to the United States, for example, will not be affected by these judgments and will continue to be made based on the Department's directives, as mentioned above. The contracting out of cases to other EU member states, primarily the United Kingdom, and the United States has been a facility used by health boards. These contracts are outside the terms of Regulation (EC) 1408/71.</P>

      <P>The document in question originated with a <Col N="452" /> review group established by the health board chief executive officers and it was made available to my Department in September 2000. Consistent with my Department's overall approach to transparency, and with the agreement of the review group, this document was made available to the public at the earliest opportunity. However, prior to placing the document in the public domain, my Department was advised by the secretariat to the review group that an action plan which had been an appendix in earlier drafts of the report had been detached because it was no longer relevant. Many of the dates indicated in the action plan had passed. Accordingly, my officials were asked to detach this out of date material from copies of the report in their possession and this was done to avoid confusion and to ensure that the most up to date version of the report was available. The integrity and completeness of the report were not compromised.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 605 and 640 together.</P>
      <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new therapies for many disorders becoming available.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to such services. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I have requested Comhairle Na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal has established a committee with the following terms of reference: to examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and, following consultation with the interests concerned, to make <Col N="453" /> recommendations to Comhairle Na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 Comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
    <P>The need for additional investment in the neurological and neurosurgical service will be considered in the light of the review by An Comhairle, other competing priorities and the availability of adequate funding.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on a recent report (details supplied) that a growing number of hospitals are being forced to use unlicensed medicines; his views on the possible medico-legal consequences; and the plans he has to address this matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of unlicensed medicinal products, including the use of authorised medicinal products for indications for which they have not been authorised, is one which health services in all countries in the developed world have to take into account. No country today can have available such a range of authorised medicinal products as to be in a position to effectively treat all the medical conditions and illnesses that are likely to be encountered in their population. For that reason, provision has always been included in the legislative controls for medicinal products so that products that are necessary for the treatment of patients, in the circumstances where the required authorised products are not available, may be obtained.</P>
      <P>The primary legislative provisions for this purpose are contained in Article 4 of the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998 (SI 142 of 1998) where, in addition to providing certain exemptions for extemporaneous compounding, exemptions have been provided for the importation or sale of a medicinal product by or to the order of a registered medical practitioner or registered dentist for the treatment of a patient under his care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The controls that are applicable to medicinal products principally set out to control the activities of the pharmaceutical companies that are involved in the marketing and supply of those products. The controls, therefore, do not particularly set out to regulate the practice of medicine and the various exemptions that are provided are intended to preserve the &ldquo;clinical freedom&rdquo; of doctors with a view to enabling them to effectively treat their patients. Accordingly, under the existing provisions, doctors, in the exercise of their professional judgment and with a view to the effective medical treatment of their patients, may: prescribe unauthorised medicinal products; use, for a particular &ldquo;named&rdquo; patient, an <Col N="454" /> unauthorised medicinal product specially prepared &ndash; for example, extemporaneously &ndash; specially imported or specially supplied for that patient; use, or recommend the use of medicinal products, for indications or in doses or by routes or administration outside those recommendations set out in the relevant product authorisations; override the warnings and precautions set out in the relevant product authorisations.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for prescribing any medicinal product for a patient rests with the prescriber. If, however, an unauthorised medicinal product is prescribed, it is obvious that the responsibility of the prescriber is increased. Pharmaceutical companies, whether as wholesalers or manufacturers, are subject to licence control by the Irish Medicines Board under the respective Medical Preparations (Wholesale Licences) Regulations, 1993 (SI 39 of 1993) (as amended) and the Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1993 (SI 68 of 1993) (as amended).</P>
    <P>On that basis, if a supply of a medicinal product were to be made and in due course some information became available to that company that the particular product was defective or unsafe, it would be a serious matter for that company and for the continued holding of the required licence if it were shown not to have been in a position to identify the significance of the information concerned and not to have acted promptly and effectively on that information.</P>
    <P>In regard to the statement concerning a recent report that a growing number of hospitals are being forced to use unlicensed products I should explain that the review of medicinal products has now been completed for a number of years and arising from this and a number of incidents, for example, blood, there is a much greater appreciation of the value and need for authorisations in the interests of protecting public health. This has resulted in a focus on those medicinal products which are not authorised and companies that previously had been willing and satisfied to be the suppliers of small volume essential medicinal products are no longer willing to continue with those supplies as previously. Such products are then often sold off to other unrelated companies whose primary notice is profit with little regard to the needs of public health and the consequences of the non-availability of those products for patients. Due to the operation of price controls in all European countries, including Ireland, there are often significant price differences between countries. These differences are then exploited by certain companies in the context of parallel exportation resulting in supply difficulties and, as a direct consequence, reluctance on the part of authorisation holders to continue the traditional policy of having &ldquo;common packs&rdquo; between this country and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in these situations, the need of the smaller market often gets ignored and unauthorised alternatives are usually sought to meet the need. In some of these cases, apparent <Col N="455" /> differences between the approaches of the licensing authority in this country and in the United Kingdom are given as the reasons for the non-renewal of the authorisations concerned and consequential discontinuations. In this context also, references are frequently made to the costs of maintaining authorisation in this country, particularly for these small volume and often essential products. Where the relevant product authorisations are being maintained in other countries, because of the manner in which fees are applied by the Irish Medicines Board and the flexibility available to that board in appropriate circumstances under the Irish Medicines Board (Fees) Regulations, 1996 (SI 44 of 1966), in respect of the application of those fees, any suggestions that non-renewals and associated discontinuations are as a direct result of such costs are not justified.</P>
    <P>While the existing regulations controlling the marketing of medicinal products in this country do not incorporate significant controls on the supply of unauthorised products, it is proposed, in regulations currently under consideration in my Department, to provide for a greater supervision by the Irish Medicines Board over the supply of such products. In this context and in the light of the ongoing need for the availability of such unauthorised medicinal products for the essential treatment of patients, it will remain the responsibility of the prescriber to decide the circumstances in which he-she will prescribe an authorised medicinal product in the best interests of the patient.</P>

Any change in VHI's corporate status will require legislation and would, therefore, be a matter for consideration and discussion in this House.</P>

Following submissions to the chairman from both sides, further information was requested from the official side and this was supplied.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to European Directive 2001/19. This directive amends earlier EC directives dealing with the free movement of doctors and the recognition of professional qualifications as well as training undergone and-or professional experience gained in a member state. I am sure the Deputy is aware that, under earlier EU directives dealing with this area, training posts have been available to non EU doctors for many years. Many of the doctors concerned have in the past worked or currently work within the Irish hospital service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Cardiovascular diseases include coronary heart disease, stroke &ndash; cerebrovascular disease, and related diseases of blood vessels. Overall there were 12,660 deaths from these diseases in Ireland in the year 2000, including 6629 from coronary ischaemic heart disease. These are provisional fig<Col N="462" /> ures. However, comparative data for 2000 for the UK are not yet available.</P>
      <P>Figures from earlier years show that the rates, age standardised, are higher in Ireland than in the UK. This reflects higher death rates in Ireland from heart disease. Death rates from stroke are similar in Ireland to the UK and indeed are similar to the average for the EU.</P>
      <P>Death rates from coronary heart disease vary substantially between the constituent countries of the UK. Rates are higher in Scotland and in Northern Ireland than in England and Wales, with a north-south gradient within England. Death rates are higher in Scotland than in Ireland. However, the death rates in Irish women started to decrease slowly in the 1960s. Rates have been decreasing rapidly in men and women throughout the British Isles since the mid-1980s.</P>
      <P>Other countries such as the United States and Australia have experienced similar changes in the epidemic of cardiovascular diseases. The increased life expectancy and longer survival times of patients mean that larger numbers of older people are living with these diseases. This requires attention to the prevention of recurrent events, secondary prevention, as well as ongoing treatment for their conditions. With this in mind my Department developed in 1999 a strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, to address our high rate of cardiovascular disease. This strategy is being implemented in a planned and structured manner over a five year period. Our medium term goal is to reduce the rate of cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average and our long-term objective is to reach rates similar to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>

      <P>The birth to which the Deputy referred took place at home and is one to which the provisions of the Status of Children Act, 1987 applies. The Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1996, include provisions for the entry to paternity details in the register of births in respect of children born to parents not married to each other. Section 49 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, outlines the procedures to be followed and these include the registration of the father's details in the register of births on the joint application for registration by the parents, on the application by one or other parents with co-operation of the other parent or on the sole application of either the father or the mother of the child on the production of a certified copy of a court order naming the father of the child.</P>
      <P>In the instance referred to by the Deputy, as three months have elapsed since the date of the birth of the child, the parents are required to make a statutory declaration setting out the details to be entered in the register of births.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 632 to 635, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In view of the level of administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date, health boards were requested to examine how the administration of out of date vaccines occurred and the measures which should be put in place to prevent a recurrence. This matter was also brought to the attention of the Irish College of General Practitioners which was asked to review the matter and to consider the development of protocols in respect of vaccine administration.</P>
      <P>In view of this incident health boards were also asked to examine systems and procedures currently in place, identify shortcomings where these exist and put in place revised systems-procedures as a matter of urgency. Health boards have also been asked to take appropriate measures in respect of vaccines administered from 2001 onwards to ensure the validation of all key information, that is, patient name, batch number and expiry date by cross reference to registration and supply databases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responses received on behalf of the health boards have indicated that the systems referred to above have either been or are currently subject to review. This review is being undertaken in the context of the national review, which is being organised by the national immunisation steering committee. This committee is addressing a wide range of issues relating to the childhood immunis<Col N="466" /> ation programme and is expected to report later this year.</P>
    <P>My Department also requested health boards to examine all childhood immunisation records to determine if children were given other out of date vaccine. As a first step details of batch numbers and expiry dates of each vaccine were sought from the relevant vaccine manu-</P>
    <P>facturers/suppliers. The health boards have indicated that the volume of records is extensive and that it will take considerable time to extract the information required. The difficulties are compounded by the fact that some of the records are not computerised.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out the number of oral polio vaccine doses, based on the latest information received from the health boards, which were administered after the expiry date.</P>

      <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations <Col N="467" /> are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance.

      <P>The current rates of subvention are £90, £120 and £150 &ndash; 114.28, 152.37, 190.46 &ndash; depending on whether the assessed level of dependency is medium, high or maximum.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. One of the review group's recommendations was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. An accord has been reached between the Dental Council, the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork and the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry to establish specialist dental training in this country on a sound footing. The Dublin Dental Hospital, Trinity College and health boards have advertised a specialist training programme in orthodontics and six dentists for the health board orthodontic services will commence training this month. The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics and a resolution to the issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the setting up of a specialist register and the creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health board service will result in a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service. I have also approached the Dental Council concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling greater caseloads to be achieved. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    <P>Overall, this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists. The health boards have advised me that the ultimate effect of their proposals when fully implemented, will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the chief executive officers of the health boards that at the end of the June 2001 quarter there were 15,527 patients in treatment. The chief executive officers of the health boards have also informed me that the number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment in their areas of responsibility at the end of the June 2001 quarter were as follows:</P>

    <P>Patients are referred for secondary care orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department that prioritise need for treatment based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients but have a definite need of treatment and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new therapies for many disorders becoming available.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups I have requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle na nOspidéal has established a committee with the following terms of reference: to examine the existing <Col N="470" /> arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
    <P>The need for additional investment in the neurological and neurosurgical service will be considered in the light of the review by an comhairle, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 641 and 642 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Nursing recognised the need for a coherent approach to the progression of specialisation and the development of a clinical career pathway in nursing and midwifery. This function is vested in the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national council has issued clear guidelines to all health service providers concerning the process through which clinical nurse or midwife specialist posts should be developed and <Col N="471" /> approved. It is working closely with the regional nursing and midwifery planning and development units, which have responsibility for the strategic planning of nursing and midwifery services in a health board area, to encourage the development of specialist posts based on identified service and patient needs. Part of the process set out in the national council's guidelines involves health service providers submitting plans for the development of clinical nurse or midwife specialist posts to the relevant nursing and midwifery planning and development unit for consideration. Accordingly any proposal by the Mater Misericordiae Hospital for the development of a neurological nurse specialist post should be submitted to the nursing and midwifery planning and development unit in the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>The national council is independent in the discharge of its statutory functions and I have had no discussions with it regarding individual proposals for the development of posts in specialist nursing practice.</P>
    <P>My Department does not routinely collate data relating to out-patient waiting lists. However, as responsibility for the funding of services at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority I have asked the regional chief executive to investigate the issue and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Nursing report has provided a solid framework for the enhancement of the delivery of midwifery services through the development of a new clinical career pathway for midwives. This framework provides for the creation of clinical midwife specialist and advanced midwife practitioner posts.</P>
      <P>A National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has been established to give guidance in relation to the development of such posts based on service and patient needs. The national council has approved 26 applications for clinical midwife posts to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience in Ireland over many decades has demonstrated the safety for both mother and baby of being delivered in consultant staffed maternity units. International evidence in recent years, however, has demonstrated that in selected <Col N="472" /> cases, alternative arrangements such as home birth can lead to safe delivery for mother and baby.</P>
      <P>The provision of maternity services generally is the responsibility of the health boards. However, health boards are experiencing difficulties in providing services for home births because of the practice of hospital confinement over the past 20 to 25 years and the consequent unavailability of experienced practitioners in home delivery. Following the report of the maternity and infant care scheme review group, the health boards chief executive officers established an expert group to consider the approaches to home births suggested by the review group and to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>The expert group recommended the following three pilot projects which were subsequently established and have been funded by the Department: a community midwifery service, to be conducted in Cork by the Southern Health Board; a hospital outreach approach to be conducted by the Western Health Board and based at the University College Hospital, Galway and; a DOMINO, domiciliary care in and out of hospital, outreach project, based at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street. Following evaluation of the projects the policy, procedures and protocols necessary for domiciliary births will be developed.</P>

      <P>Each year, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, notifies each health board of its determination for the following year. It is a matter for the individual health board to allocate these funds having regard to the level of service provided by the board. The Western Health Board has indicated to my Department that it will examine the funding for TOPE in the light of the board's 2002 determination. There has been a significant expansion in the provision of special educational facilities for people with disabilities in recent years and my Department has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science in providing health-related support services to these facilities.</P>

      <P>On 1 August 2001 I published the new Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, to give effect to the proposals in the Government's policy document Towards a Tobacco Free Society. I propose to introduce the Bill in the Dáil at the earliest possible date. However, at this stage, I am awaiting confirmation of a date for the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned over the levels of smoking among children and unrestricted access by underage persons to cigarettes from vending machines. About 30% of the adult population are severely addicted to nicotine in tobacco products and the vast majority of smokers become addicted in their childhood and teenage years. Many vending machines are located in areas of premises, often out of sight of staff, where there is no form of supervision.</P>
      <P>The new Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, provides for much tighter controls on all aspects of tobacco retailing including access to vending machines. I have informed the representative body of cigarette machine operators of the need for much tighter controls on cigarette vending machines. I have confirmed to them that future regulations in this area will be drafted in such a way as to provide for the sale of tobacco products in licensed premises only from vending machines activated for each sale by a unique coin or token available only from staff on the premises. The machines, which will have a locking device, will be located beside, on or behind the bar counter under the direct supervision of staff.</P>

      <P>A new foster care allowance scheme was introduced in August this year. The allowances to be paid in respect of children placed in care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, are £200 per week for a child under 12, an increase from £71.55, and £220 for a child of 12 and over, an increase from £85.75. The new scheme incorporates the orphan's pension and allowance. Under the new scheme the majority <Col N="477" /> of discretionary payments, previously paid by the health boards, have been abolished. However, discretionary payments may still be considered for educational fees and medical expenses not covered by the general medical service. The new scheme was introduced following the recommendations made in the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care &ndash; A Child Centred Partnership. The report recommended that discretionary payments made by health boards be abolished and that the allowances be increased to the new rates. The report further recommended that, in view of the new allowances, that orphan's pensions and allowances should not be paid in respect of children in foster care. It was not possible to implement the new scheme exactly in the manner set out in the report. The new allowance is however designed to achieve the objective of the report, which is to provide foster carers with an adequate allowance to look after their foster children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 29 November 2000, I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service and addressing shortages in specialist areas. As part of the initiative, I made funding available for nursing courses in specified specialised areas of clinical practice, including intensive care, in order to address the critical shortage of nurses in those areas. In particular, I have provided funding for the establishment of new courses in hospitals outside of Dublin, including the Cork hospitals, Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. This is being done to arrest the drift of specialist nurses from the acute Dublin hospitals. The availability of new programmes in hospitals around the country is intended to free up places in the Dublin hospitals which can be allocated to Dublin based nurses.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative nurses or midwives undertaking certain specialist courses will receive full pay while doing so. They will also be entitled to have their fees paid in full, in return for a commitment on their part to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area for one year &ndash; 12 months &ndash; following completion of the course.</P>
      <P>The initiative initially applied to postregistration courses in the following areas of clinical practice: accident and emergency; critical care, including intensive care, coronary care and burns; and peri-operative, including peri-anaesthesia, operating theatre and operating department. However, in May of this year I approved the extension of the initiative to include all higher diploma and certificate courses in specialised areas of clinical practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> These initiatives form part of my overall nurse recruitment-retention strategy, which is currently funded to the level of some £9 million annually.

      <P>Central Government funding for local authorities, whether for major capital projects or for general purposes is not calculated on a <i>per capita </i>basis, nor would it be appropriate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> Capital funding is based on projects currently under way and will clearly vary from year to year. For example, funding for South Dublin County Council would have been quite extensive during the active phases of developing the M50 in its area. Funding for general purposes comes predominantly through the local government fund. Allocations from this fund reflect the financial needs of the local authority concerned, not necessarily related to population, and, most importantly, its ability to raise revenue from other sources such as commercial rates and charges for services.</P>
    <P>I note that South Dublin County Council's general purpose grant allocation has increased substantially since 1997. The allocation for 2001 represents a 12.5% increase over the funding provided in 2000 and a 48% increase over the initial allocation for 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 662, 671 and 721 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 indicated that, in common with a majority of EU member states, the Government did not propose at that stage to regulate for a specific prohibition on the use of mobile phones by drivers. The safe use of mobile phones by drivers was instead to be promoted through information campaigns, including campaigns supported by the mobile phone industry. Initiatives in this regard have been duly developed.</P>
      <P>However, additional considerations such as the greatly increased market penetration of mobile phones and growing concerns about the possible adverse effects on road safety when they are used inappropriately, have also arisen since the strategy was adopted. I am therefore now considering the regulation of their use by drivers and have asked the high level group on road safety for a view on what could constitute appropriate measures.</P>

      <P>To meet Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to stabilise greenhouse gas, a substantial improvement in energy conservation in buildings is essential. About 40% of CO2 emissions are attributable to energy used in the heating, cooling, and lighting of buildings, therefore energy conservation in buildings must be an integral part of lowering such emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently published &ndash; 27 September 2001 &ndash; consultation documents on the proposed amendment of the Part L  &ndash; Conservation of Fuel and Energy of the national building regulations. The proposed revision will radically upgrade thermal performance and insulation standards for new dwellings, commencing on or after 1 July 2002. The new thermal performance <Col N="482" /> and insulation standards for new dwellings are as follows:</P>

    <P>It is estimated that the new standards will reduce energy requirements for space and water heating by 23% to 33%, depending on the type and size of dwellings. On current patterns of fuel use, this will give a reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 300,000 tonnes per annum for 2012. This is broadly in line with projections for improved building regulations in the national climate change strategy &ndash; November, 2000.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce the new regulations in a single step, rather than on a phased basis in 2002 and 2005, as originally proposed. I have consulted the building regulations advisory body &ndash; BRAB &ndash; who have advised me that all building systems commonly used in Ireland can be adapted to comply with the stricter standard. I plan to announce my proposals for enhanced energy conservation for non-residential buildings, under Part L of the building code, by the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>I will also be amending technical guidance document F &ndash; ventilation &ndash; on the building code to require mechanical ventilation &ndash; extractor fans &ndash; in the wet areas of new houses, namely bathrooms and kitchens.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that this is necessary to minimise the risk of condensation in new houses, which are likely to be more airtight due to the provision of better insulation. The installation of mechanical ventilation will only represent around 0.5% of the average cost of new dwellings and will not therefore add significantly to housing costs.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for copies of the consultation documents to be forwarded to the Deputy and to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>However, additional considerations such as the greatly increased market penetration of mobile phones and growing concerns about the possible adverse effects on road safety when they are used inappropriately, have also arisen since the strategy was adopted. I am therefore now considering the regulation of their use by drivers and have asked the high level group on road safety for a view on what could constitute appropriate measures.</P>

      <P>The strategy contains a sectoral breakdown of emissions for 1990, 1998 and projections for 2010, with and without the measures set out in the strategy.

      <P>The sectoral emissions data for 1999 derived from this report are being prepared and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Projections of emissions on an annual basis for 2008 to 2012 are not available.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, through the local authorities, is addressing the situation of households dependent on private individual water supplies in a number of ways. New local authority regional water supply schemes, and extensions to existing distribution systems, are providing an alternative public water supply to households situated along pipeline routes. <Col N="484" /> Households not directly served by, or adjacent to, public schemes can avail of group water scheme capital grants of up to 85% of cost, subject to a cost limit of £6,000 per house, for extending the public supply to their homes by way of group scheme. Where a local authority source is not available, groups are permitted to develop suitable local sources.</P>
      <P>Grants of up to £1,600 per house &ndash; 2,031 &ndash; are available to households for the provision or upgrading of a private water supply to a single house where an alternative public or group scheme supply is not readily available. Eligible works include the drilling of a new well, the provision or replacement of pumping plant and any necessary water treatment or disinfection equipment.</P>
      <P>The piloting of new technologies for treating small scale rural water supply systems is ongoing and innovative processes based on, inter alia, membrane filtration, media filtration and ozonation have been successfully tested under Irish conditions. Similar systems are currently being installed in a number of privately sourced group water schemes using design, build, operate &ndash; DBO &ndash; procurement. Last year I introduced a new 100% grant for the provision of essential water treatment and disinfection facilities in quality deficient group schemes, together with a substantial increase in the level of subsidy towards the operational costs of these plants. A number of single house and under-sink water treatment systems designed for use in small group schemes or individual domestic water supply systems are also being tested at various locations.</P>
      <P>Based on the level of interest in this approach within the group sector, and the record levels of funding being devoted to the rural water programme, up from £8 million &ndash; 10.15 million &ndash; in 1996 to £44 million &ndash; 55.8 million &ndash; this year, I expect that the take up on these solutions will accelerate rapidly and that the current deficiencies in the quality of some rural supplies will be eradicated at an early date.</P>

In a related development, discussions between the Commission and the car manufacturers representative group ACEA on a voluntary agreement covering the development of pedestrian friendly fronts on vehicles have reached an advanced stage. Among the complementary measures proposed by ACEA for inclusion in the <Col N="487" /> agreement is the provision of equipment to support DRL requirements in new cars.</P>
    <P>Against this background, Dublin Corporation, with the support of my Department, are planning to commence a pilot DRL campaign for the coming winter. I intend that the lessons from the pilot exercise as well as the views of various groups that have concerns about a general application of DRL, will inform decisions regarding the future promotion of DRL at national level.</P>

      <P>Under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, primary responsibility for tackling litter pollution rests with local authorities. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the level of expenditure on individual local services as part of its annual estimates process. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources such as rates, fees, charges and the social government fund, which in recent years has increased substantially the level of resources available to local authorities for general purposes, including for anti-</P>
      <P>litter action.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides dedicated financial assistance to support local authority action against litter. The relevant Exchequer provision for 2001 is £950,000, an increase of 19% on the 2000 figure; this funding is used for a range of specific initiatives, including grants to local authorities in respect of litter education/awareness.</P>
      <P>My Department has no record of having received an application as referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000 requires An Bord Pleanála to give the main reasons and considerations on which its decision on an appeal is based. Draft regulations which will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act into force, have been prepared by my Department and sent on an informal basis to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. Oireachtas approval of the regulations is required and I hope to be in a position to make the regulations shortly with a view to bringing the development control provisions of the Act into force early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála does not maintain any statistics in relation to the number of times it decides to grant permission for development which would contravene materially the provisions of the development plan. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, sets out new provisions on the circumstances where the board may grant permission for development which contravenes materially the relevant development plan. Section 37(2) of the 2000 Act provides that in cases where the planning authority decides in the first instance to refuse permission on the grounds that proposed development would materially contravene the development plan, the board may only grant permission when it considers that: the proposed development is of strategic or national importance; or there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated in so far as the proposed development is concerned; or permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to regional planning guidelines for the area, ministerial guidelines under section 28, the <Col N="490" /> statutory obligations of any local authority in the area, and any relevant policy of the Government, the Minister or any Minister or permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to the pattern of development, and permissions granted, in the area since the making of development plan.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the board to maintain records on decisions taken which contravene the relevant development plan once the provisions of Section 37 have been commenced with following the making of the regulations referred to above.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 681, 700 and 729 together.</P>
      <P>The leaflet in question, distributed by the so-called No Incineration Alliance, is offensive and misleading. It is an exercise in scaremongering which misrepresents and falsifies facts and does a disservice to genuine public debate around proposed regional waste infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The first collaborative report of the two cancer registries in the island of Ireland, published in May 2001, shows that one in three of the population of the island is likely to contract some form of cancer by age 74. This report was intended to provide information for future action to prevent cancer, improve care and treatment services and strengthen research arrangements in Ireland. It is highly inappropriate to use its findings for propaganda purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities were advised, in my waste policy statement Changing our Ways, that achievement of national waste objectives requires,<i> inter alia</i>, a major reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of treatment options to deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets. Authorities were asked to identify and fully assess the various issues involved, <Col N="492" /> with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix of facilities which, at a regional level, appear to offer the best balance between maximised recovery of materials or energy and minimised environmental emissions, at reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>Against this background, regional waste management plans subsequently adopted by 23 local authorities provide,<i> inter alia</i>, for five thermal treatment facilities to recover energy from waste that cannot otherwise be re-used or recycled.</P>
    <P>In addition, the EPA's national hazardous waste management plan identifies a need for a thermal treatment facility for hazardous waste.</P>
    <P>It is open to the private sector to bring forward proposals for thermal treatment facilities on a commercial basis, as is the case in relation to the proposed incinerator near Drogheda. Such proposals may have implications for the provision of thermal treatment capacity under local authority regional plans.</P>
    <P>As regards thermal treatment itself, I am advised that emissions from proposed thermal treatment facilities, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, do not present a significant risk to the environment or public health. EU legislation and policy also clearly contemplates the provision of thermal treatment facilities, which now operate in a majority of EU member states. All significant waste facilities are subject to full environmental impact assessment, planning controls and a rigorous environmental licensing system operated by the EPA, which must take the precautionary principle into account. The EPA is legally precluded from licensing a waste facility unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not cause environmental pollution, that is to say will not to a significant extent endanger public health or harm the environment. The EPA, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions, considers that municipal waste incineration, operating to the best modern standards, and incorporating energy recovery, is preferable to landfill from an environmental viewpoint.</P>
    <P>However, I accept that many people have genuinely held concerns about perceived health threats from thermal treatment or incineration, concerns which may be exacerbated by misinformation and misrepresentation. Concerns about new waste infrastructure generally will be mitigated only by demonstrating that our regulatory process is effective and can be relied upon, and by systematic communication and information at national and local level which provides the public with well-founded information and reasoned assurance.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Health Research Board (HRB) to provide a study utilising appropriate research expertise in health and environmental sciences which will contain an objective, independent and expert analysis of all available information regarding the likely effects of landfill and thermal treatment, especially incineration activi<Col N="493" /> ties on public health and the environment. I except a study team to be appointed shortly by the HRB. It is anticipated that the study will conclude by the end of February 2002 and a report will be published shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>The HRB study will encompass, but not be limited to: an evaluation of recorded impacts on public health and the environment from emissions from old landfills and thermal treatment technologies, i.e. facilities and technologies in operation prior to the imposition of modern operational requirements and emission standards; an assessment of the risk posed by emissions from modern landfills and thermal treatment technologies, i.e. operating to current EU standards, to public health and the environment, in the case of thermal treatment, emissions to be considered will include dioxins, heavy metals, particulates and nitrogen oxides emitted to the atmosphere, and emissions arising from the recovery or landfill disposal of &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; and &ldquo;fly&rdquo; ashes; the impact of current emission standards on the risk involved for public health and the environment; a comparison of risks posed to public health and the environment by emissions from modern thermal treatment plant with those posed by similar emissions from other sectors; a critical analysis of claims made by interests promoting and opposed to thermal treatment of wastes as to the impact of emissions on public health and the environment; and evaluation of the significance of biomarkers as indicators of exposure to emissions and their significance as indicators of potential health problems.</P>
    <P>It will be a condition of the HRB study contract that the person or team awarded the contract will have regard to any relevant material submitted by interested groups.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, confers a right to retain, as a tenant, possession of a formerly rent controlled dwelling for the lifetime of the person who was the tenant at the commencement of the Act, 26 July 1982 and for the lifetime of their spouse. Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeeded to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to protection under the 1982 Act continues to 25 July 2002, with a minimum tenancy period of five years even where this may extend beyond that date. Successor tenants may claim a renewable lease for up to 35 years under the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, once the above protection ceases.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering the implications for successor tenants of the expiration of the right to protection under the 1982 Act in order to determine what action may be appropriate.</P>

      <P>Under Part VI of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (No. 7 of 1992) and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Noise) Regulations, 1994, (S.I. No. 179 of 1994) made thereunder, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing neighbourhood noise nuisance is available from my Department.</P>
      <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland &ndash; NSAI &ndash; has published a voluntary standard specification (No. 199 of 1987), and operates a certification scheme to that standard, which, <i>inter alia</i>, specifies a minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of external intruder alarms in buildings. The connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda Siochána stations is contingent, <i>inter alia</i>, upon the use of alarm systems which are certified by NSAI and installed by certified installers.</P>

      <P>In August 1998, following a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding overpayments on a number of local authority housing loans, my Department requested local authorities to: identify any cases of over-payments on mature housing loans; take appropriate action to ensure that any overpayments on paid up mature loans are refunded; where appropriate, alert borrowers to contact their paying bank with instructions to terminate their Standing Orders and adopt appropriate procedures to ensure that over-payments of paid up loans do not occur in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also consulted with the Local Government Computer Services Board whose housing loans system is used by most local authorities. As a result, the board have assisted local authorities in preventing any recurence of the problem. The board issued a new reporting program which highlights when a transaction occurs on a paid up account and, in addition, the board <Col N="498" /> held a number of training courses on the housing loans system throughout the country to advise local authority staff of procedures designed to prevent overpayments. Those local authorities who do not use the board's system were also requested by the Department to ensure that their system incorporates a facility to clearly identify paid up loans.</P>
    <P>In February 1999, the Office of the Ombudsman informed my Department that the Ombudsman had decided to investigate the matter in all local authorities. A report of the Ombudsman's findings was published in July 2000 and copies are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any cases where the over-payments identified in the Ombudsman's report were not refunded.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 692 and 708 together.</P>
      <P>EU directives concerning the harmonisation of driver testing and licensing regimes in member states standardise the classification of vehicle categories for testing and licensing purposes and require that applicants for driving licences must pass a theoretical test and a driving test of skills and behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the EU classification of licence categories was introduced in Ireland in 1989, driving licence holders maintained their existing entitlement to drive but under revised licence categories. Since then drivers wishing to obtain an additional category on their licence, to which they <Col N="499" /> are not currently entitled, are required to pass the driving test, and now, the driver theory test.</P>
    <P>Driver theory testing commenced on 11 June 2001 and applications for first provisional licences, in any licence category, made on or after that date, must be accompanied by a theory test certificate.</P>
    <P>A driver theory test must also be successfully completed by any person who made application to a licensing authority for a first provisional licence, in any licence category, on or after 25 April 2001. As an interim measure from 25 April 2001 to 10 June 2001 applicants were, in the first instance, granted a provisional licence for a limited period of 90 days. On submission to the licensing authority of a theory test certificate for the appropriate licence category the validity period of the licence is extended for the balance of the period for which a provisional licence is normally granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of major road project planning, local authorities initiate, at <Col N="500" /> an early stage, a process of public consultation in connection with route selection. Typically the initial public consultation takes the form of an information brochure or similar material addressed to local communities and business interests outlining the need for the project, a general description of broad band corridor route options and a questionnaire seeking the views and concerns of the public. In addition, public presentations are arranged by the local authority at a number of venues in the area concerned to outline the proposal and address requests for information or clarification.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the public response, together with the findings of studies conducted to identify route constraints, the local authority identifies a preferred route, which is also the subject of public consultation. The primary purpose of the consultation exercise is to bring the public up to date on developments in the planning of the project taking account of public feedback and the findings of constraint studies and, in particular, to outline information on the preferred route option.</P>
      <P>The above consultations are pre-statutory and it is not considered appropriate for them to be subjected to detailed regulation. The statutory procedures for taking forward major road projects which involve environmental impact assessment and motorway scheme or compulsory purchase order, are set out in Part IV of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the NRA-local authorities to comply with statutory procedures in relation to public notice and the provision of access to environmental impact statements, motorway schemes and CPOs.</P>

      <P>Total payments to local authorities in respect of waste recovery infrastructure under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 (Waste Management Sub-Programme) amounted to £3,106,958. Grant payments in 1998, 1999 and 2000 were as follows: 1998, £173,995; 1999, £1,281,477; 2000, £624,111.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No grant payments issued in 2001 as payments under the operational programme concluded at the end of 2000.

I will announce details of this new grants scheme shortly.</P>
    <P>National waste statistics are published at three yearly intervals by the Environmental Protection Agency. The first national waste database report, in respect of 1995, estimated that out of total municipal waste &ndash; household and commercial &ndash; arisings of 1,503,171 tonnes in that year, 117,732 tonnes (7.8%) were recycled. The most recent 1998 national waste database report, which was published in March 2000, estimated that out of total municipal waste arisings of 1,852,450 tonnes in that year, 166,684 tonnes &ndash; 9% &ndash; were recycled. The next database report will deal with 2001 but will not be available until late 2002 at the earliest. However, taking account of recent increases in packaging waste recovery in particular, the indications are that the recycling performance of municipal waste generally has increased since 1998.</P>

      <P>The national rural water monitoring committee has reported to me with proposals for meeting the wastewater collection and treatment needs of small rural communities.

The confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the results of the pilot programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 703 and 704 together.</P>
      <P>The erection of telecommunications masts requires planning permission from the relevant planning authority unless exempted under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and regulations. In July 1996, my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. The guidelines now have a specific statutory status under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Section 28 provides that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard to any such guidelines in the performance of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> The guidelines specifically recommend that only as a last resort, and if all alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should consideration be given to locating free-standing masts in a residential area or beside schools. A statement on health and safety aspects which the Departments of Health and Children and Public Enterprise agreed with my Department, is included as an appendix to the guidelines. Health aspects are dealt with by requiring operators, as part of their planning application, to furnish to the planning authority a statement of compliance with International Radiation Protection Association guidelines.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that planning issues relating to the siting of such telecommunications masts and base stations are adequately addressed in the guidelines and that they are best dealt with in this way rather than in regulations. Accordingly, it is not proposed to make specific regulations in this matter.</P>

      <P>The deadlines by which planning authorities have to incorporate retail strategies in their development plans have not yet been reached. The guidelines provide that planning authorities outside of the greater Dublin area, as defined in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, have 18 months from the date of publication of the guidelines, until 30 June 2002, to incorporate retail policies and proposals into their development plans. The guidelines indicate an urgent need to put in place a comprehensive and detailed retail planning strategy in the greater Dublin area.

      <Quest>if he will bring forward legislation to allow for the charging by local authorities of statutory undertakers, particularly telecom operators, to ensure compliance and enforcement of the local authority regulations and expeditious completion of work.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Powers available under existing legislation, in particular section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, are being used by urban road authorities to regulate the opening of roads by utilities. For example, Dublin Corporation is making extensive use of these powers through its directions for the control and management of roadworks in Dublin city. General guidance on the need for an efficient and expeditious approach to road works, whether by road authorities or other statutory undertakers, is also set out in my Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A utilities and statutory bodies working group, chaired by the Dublin Transportation Office, or DTO, was established this year. The aim of the working group is to standardise the approach to roadworks through agreed codes of practice. It is composed of representatives from various bodies and agencies currently involved in telecom<Col N="511" /> munications network roll-out including the Office of the Director of Communications, the DTO, the Departments of Public Enterprise and Environment and Local Government, urban and rural local authorities, IBEC, Forfás, the National Roads Authority and Eircom.</P>
    <P>A Bill to regulate communications being prepared by the Department of Public Enterprise will propose, <i>inter alia</i>, to modernise legislation in relation to road openings by telecom operators. This Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government following approval of the general scheme of the Bill earlier this year. My Department is in communication with the Department of Public Enterprise to ensure that the regulatory framework to apply to such operators will afford appropriate and updated powers to road authorities to regulate road openings in the public interest, while recognising the benefits of further investment in telecommunications infrastructure. I am also considering a wider legislative updating to deal with this important matter.</P>

      <P>Novice riders of category A motorcycles are restricted to riding and gaining experience on lower powered motorcycles, those with a power output not exceeding 25 kW or a power to weight ratio not exceeding 0.16kW/kg, before being given access to higher powered motorcycles. This restriction applies for the period of the provisional licence in category A and for a period of two years after the granting of a category A driving licence. These arrangements are considered desirable in the interest of road safety and against the background of the disproportionately high accident and fatality rate of motorcyclists in Ireland compared to other categories of road users. Consequently, Ireland did not avail of the option under EU Directive 91/439 on driver licensing of allowing direct access to higher powered motorcycles at the age of 21. The progression arrangements for new motorcyclists will be kept under review in the light of motorcycle accident and fatality rates and the impact of the motorcycle training initiative being undertaken by the Irish Rider Training Association with support from my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>The planning Acts allow for planning conditions concerning security, the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures. Effective use of such conditions by local authorities and enforcement action can do much to obviate problems of unfinished estates. Responsibility for enforcement of planning controls is a matter for planning authorities. In addition, it is open to any person to seek a court order under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, as amended, which requires compliance with any conditions laid down by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, includes strengthened provisions regarding the enforcement of planning law and enables planning authorities to refuse to grant permission to developers who have not complied with previous permissions, subject to the consent of the High Court. The 2000 Act, when brought into force, will require planning authorities to take charge of housing estates. When an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority, the authority will be required to take it in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so. If an estate is unfinished, the seven year period for taking enforcement action has expired and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will be obliged to take the estate in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend shortly to commence these provisions together with the general development control provisions of the Act. Draft regulations, which will enable the development control provisions of <Col N="513" /> the Act to be brought into force, have been prepared by my Department and sent on an informal basis to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. Oireachtas approval of the regulations is required and I hope to be in a position to make the regulations shortly with a view to bringing the development control provisions of the Act into force early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The new taxi regime which has been established by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, is already bringing significant benefits to service users through the increased availability of taxis. Dublin Corporation, as the largest taxi licensing authority in the State, has engaged consultants to carry out a customer service assessment comparing current service levels with those obtaining during the last such assessment in 1998 and to identify potential areas for further service improvement. I anticipate that this study will provide more broadly based and up to date information on the level of taxi services in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I intend that the process of making all taxis wheelchair accessible will commence by the end of 2003. I have also made clear my intention to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services for the benefit of service providers and the general public, in the medium term. My Department will finalise a consultation document in the near future. The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, (S.I. No. 182 of 1997), as amended by the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1998, (S.I. No. 441 of 1998), provide the statutory basis for the use of bus lanes. Such use is generally limited to buses and, in the case of with flow bus lanes, to cyclists. An exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis using with flow bus lanes. Taxis are allowed to utilise that exemption when in the course of business. Enforcement of these regulations and the public service vehicle regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>My Department has exercised an ongoing oversight and support of local authority emergency services, through the financing of capital investment programmes, the development and updating of an emergency planning framework and guidelines and the promotion of training and other initiatives. In pursuance of this role, my Department has also recently commenced a major review of the fire services. Initial indications from this review confirm the generally good operational capacity and training of local authority fire services.

      <P>In liaison with the high level contact group set up by the Government to monitor developments and emergency services following the events of 11 September, my Department has recently advised local authorities to review their major emergency plans and local plans, including plans for security protection of water resources and drinking water supplies, to ensure that they are up to date and effective. Local authorities have also been advised that information about current plans should be available to all service providers and to the public. I intend that the emergency services overseen and co-ordinated by my Department within this framework will co-operate fully with the further arrangements now established by the Government and which are set out in the reply of the Minister for Defence to Question No. 257 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 738 and 739 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, requires local authorities carrying out a statutory assessment of needs under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, to include a separate assessment for the needs for caravan sites for Travellers. The assessment must include the assessment of need for sites with limited facilities, normally referred to as transient sites, to take account of the annual pattern of movement of Travellers. Under the 1998 Act, local authorities are required to have regard to the need for transient sites as identified in assessments of need and Traveller accommodation programmes.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to amend the 1998 Act to prohibit Travellers vacating permanent accommodation for the purposes of travelling elsewhere as I consider such a provision would not be enforceable. There are no proposals to establish a central body to co-ordinate the provision of accommodation for Travellers moving as part of the annual pattern of movement of Travellers. However, the guidelines for accommodating transient traveller families issued by my Department in June 2000 advise local authorities to encourage Traveller families to ascertain the position regarding accommodation before moving to another area. The guidelines also advise local authorities to give priority to Traveller families who reserve places on transient sites in advance, where such sites are provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The average waiting time for a driving test at the Dungarvan driving test centre is ten weeks, the target waiting time in my Department's customer service action plan. As of 24 September 2001, 736 applicants were on the waiting list, of whom 309 had test appointments, 129 were not available for test and 298 were awaiting a test date. Over the past year the equivalent of one full-time tester per week has been scheduled for testing duties at the Dungarvan centre and this has had the effect of reducing the average waiting time to ten weeks. My Department does not, however, consider it necessary or in the interests of the wider efficiency of the service to assign a driver tester permanently to Dungarvan on a full-time basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 753, 757 and 758 together.</P>
      <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, published in March 1999, set out an integrated land-use and transportation framework for the sustainable development of the area. They were prepared by the constituent local authorities in the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities and my Department also participated in the process. They set out a coherent strategic planning framework for local authority development plans and for the provisions of major transportation, sanitary services and other infrastructure. Statutory recognition for the guidelines is provided in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The relevant provisions came into force on 1 January 2001 and require planning authorities in the area to have regard to the guidelines when making and adopting a development plan. Tables 9.4 to 9.7 of the guidelines document set out the principal infrastructural requirements, including those in relation to County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority allocated grants totalling over £114 million between 1994 and 2001 to Wicklow County Council for improvement and maintenance works on the county's network of national roads. The N11 is the county's most important national route, forming part of a strategic road corridor which runs from Belfast via Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford to Cork. The route has seen major development in recent years, including the Bray bypass, the Killarney road interchange, the Arklow bypass and strengthening works at various locations along the route. Further developments are under construction or in planning, such as the Glen of the Downs project and the bypass of Rathnew and Ashford.</P>
      <P>Details of proposed investment in water supply and waste water infrastructure in County Wicklow, totalling almost £60 million, are contained in my Department's water services investment programme, 2000 to 2002, which was published last year. A copy of this programme, which is the first phase of a rolling programme of investment, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of local growth, the strategic planning guidelines provide that development <Col N="524" /> outside of the metropolitan area and the identified development centres in the hinterland, should primarily be to meet local, rather than regional needs. In addition, recommendation 29 in appendix 6 to the strategic planning guidelines document states that development in areas outside the metropolitan area and the development centres should be strictly for local needs, as identified in the development plans. Primary responsibility for identifying and addressing local needs rests with the planning authority concerned through the preparation and implementation of its development plan and relevant provisions are currently being drawn up within this framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for reviewing and modernising the legislation in relation to the registration of births, deaths and marriages. The existing legislation dates back to the 1840s and needs to be thoroughly examined and overhauled so that a more modern civil registration system can be put in place to meet current and future needs. This review is taking place in the context of a major project to reorganise and computerise the general register office. Following the review I intend to publish a new Bill on the registration of births, deaths and marriages, including divorce and nullity, to update the current body of legislation and facilitate the planned organisational change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current situation with regard to venues for marriage is that civil marriages may only take place in the office of the appropriate registrar. Exceptions to this rule are only allowed on grounds of ill health of one of the parties to the proposed marriage. In general, there are no civil law restrictions on the time or place of a Roman Catholic marriage except in the cases of marriage <Col N="526" /> celebrated by special licence. Church of Ireland marriages must be celebrated in a church or chapel. There will remain other substantive issues relating to marriage which are outside the scope of this review of legislation but which must also be addressed. Accordingly, the Government has approved the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to agree an approach to the review of the legislation governing the registration of marriages and related issues. Any relevant proposals allowing civil marriages to take place in venues other that a registrar's office, a church or a chapel will be addressed by the committee which will be established shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 762, 764, 774 and 807 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also <Col N="527" /> available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care. The free travel pass is granted to the qualifying person and not to his or her children or spouse. While a spouse, regardless of age, does benefit from being able to accompany the passholder, he or she is not a qualified person and has no underlying claim until he or she reaches the qualifying age. The fact that a spouse can accompany the pass holder is a positive aspect of the scheme, which should encourage greater mobility. Extending the free travel scheme to such a group of people in their own right would be completely outside the objectives of the scheme and would discriminate against other groups such as single people, who cannot avail of the pass until reaching the qualifying age.</P>
    <P>The other free schemes, including the free electricity and gas allowances, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    <P>Since July 1996 the free schemes have been available to all lower income pensioners, including retired civil servants, who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension plus £30, plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children or living alone, as appropriate. In July 1996, when this measure was introduced, the maximum rate of old age contributory pension was £75 per week for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years and £80 for a recipient aged 80 years and over. These rates have increased by 41% and 39% respectively to £106 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years and £111 for a recipient aged 80 years or over. The income limit increases automatically each year on foot of the budget increases in pension rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to paying a telephone allowance to nursing home residents, the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion: to provide assistance for those living alone by targeting them with benefits which provide income and social inclusion gains, to support older people and people with disabilities who wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of <Col N="528" /> older people in society. The original objective of the telephone allowance was to provide protection and security at home for older people and people with disabilities who either live alone or with people unable to summon help in an emergency. A secondary objective of the scheme was to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
    <P>The free schemes act as an important support to encouraging care in the community. The proposal to extend telephone allowance to pensioners resident in nursing homes does not fit easily within the community care objectives of these schemes. Persons resident in nursing homes may already be in receipt of State support, either through the public health system or through a nursing home subvention. In addition, those living in nursing homes and other residential institutions have daily support and contact with other residents and nursing staff. The current arrangements for the free schemes are kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a number of Departments are involved in the provision of funding for voluntary and community organisations, with the remit of respective Departments determining which organisations and services may be eligible for funding. While it is not clear from the Deputy's question which aspect of the Irish Wheelchair Association's operations he is inquiring about, he may wish to note that funding for organisations dealing with disability or health issues is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and of health boards. Responsibility for funding of disability services, particularly for provision of respite care, was transferred to the Department of Health and Children in 1995 to bring greater clarity and coherence to the division of responsibilities between the two Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not in a position to provide funding for services and activities which come within the remit of other Departments. It provides support for locally-based community and family support groups involved in identifying and addressing poverty and social exclusion in their own communities through a range of programmes and once-off grant schemes. Long-term funding programmes include the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme and the programme of core funding for local community and family support groups. Once-off grant schemes include a scheme of grants for voluntary organisations, a <Col N="529" /> scheme for local community and family support groups and the community development, education and training grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The Navan branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association has received funding under the above once-off grant schemes during the past three years. In 2000, the branch received £1,000 for personal development and capacity building. In 1999, the branch received £1,000 for personal development and in 1998, £2,000 was allocated for a community arts training programme. All three donations comprised schemes of grants for local community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>An application has also been received by my Department, under the 2001 grants scheme to voluntary organisations, from the Navan branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association. The application requested funding of £1,000 for arts and crafts lessons. This application is currently under consideration in the regional office of my Department, which will make contact with the group in due course regarding the application. Details of all funding made available under various schemes and programmes are made available to the Oireachtas Library each year for the information of Members.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the law applicable to child benefit in order to provide a special twins child benefit to adoptive parents who have in their care children adopted by them who are practically the same age; the consideration he has given to representations regarding this matter received from persons (details supplied) in Dublin 14; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21112/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made, in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, for the payment of child benefit at 150% of the normal rate in the case of twins. The legislation is quite specific in defining those children in respect of whom the higher payments will be paid: &ldquo;a qualified child whose birth was part of a multiple birth of two children.&rdquo;  In considering any legislative change, it would be necessary to have equal regard to a range of other situations which would be directly comparable to that of a family with adopted children of similar ages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of illustration, the following two cases can be analysed. In the case of a family which adopts a child of a similar age to a child born to the mother, although the family is caring for two children of similar age they would not qualify for the increased child benefit rate. In the case of a family which takes on the responsibility for rearing the child of a relation who has died or is too ill to care for the child, while the child may be of <Col N="530" /> a similar age to one of the family's own children, they would not qualify for the increased child benefit rate.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is be extremely difficult to provide in legislation for the very wide range of circumstances which can arise. It is also difficult to justify any specific limitation, for example, that the children concerned would have to have been born within, say, one month of one another. Such a limitation could be viewed as being entirely arbitrary. A family with adopted children born six weeks apart could reasonably contend that their position is no different in reality to that of the family which would benefit from the one month limit. This argument would apply equally to any other limitation which might be applied.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into office, it has steadily increased expenditure on the child benefit scheme over successive budgets, culminating in the three year investment programme contained in the 2001 budget. As a first step, the increases delivered in June raised child benefit substantially by £25 per month for the first two children and £30 per month for the third and subsequent children. In the next two years, similar increases will bring investment in the scheme up to a total of some £1.5 billion per year by 2003, reflecting the seriousness of the Government's commitment to support families with children. Further extension of the scheme along the lines proposed is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and Government and programme commitments.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a means tested old age non-contributory pension in March 2001. In order to establish his means, he was requested by a local officer of the Department to provide details of his farm income. When he failed to do so, his application for a pension was disallowed. He was notified of this decision and of his right of appeal against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 2001, he applied for an old age contributory pension. One of the conditions for receipt of this pension is that the claimant must have a yearly average of at least ten social insurance contributions paid or credited from 1953, or the date of entry into insurable employment, if later, to the end of the tax year prior to reaching age 66. According to the Department's records, the person concerned has a total of 70 reckonable contributions over the 48-year period from 1953 to April 2001. This gives a yearly average of 1.5 which is well below the average of ten required for a minimum pension. A letter of notification of the decision and of a right of appeal <Col N="531" /> against it was issued to him on 1 October 2001. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed. I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 23 March 2002. Following the necessary investigations she was awarded carer's allowance at the reduced weekly rate of £18.50 plus £26.40 child dependant allowance with effect from 29 March 2001. This was increased to £76.50 per week plus £24.60 child dependant allowance with effect from 5 April 2001 as a result of improvements which were made in the 2001 budget. She was notified of this decision on 7 August 2001, including a breakdown of how her means were calculated and of her right of appeal. A book of payable orders issued to Castlebar post office payable from 2 August 2001.</P>
      <P>On 9 August 2001, her case was referred again to an investigative officer to reassess her means as her spouse had commenced self employment. Following this investigation, she was entitled to carer's allowance of £72.50 per week plus £26.40 child dependant allowance with effect from 27 September 2001. She has been notified of this decision. Arrears of carer's allowance due from 29 March 2001 to 1 August 2001 amounting to £2,194.20 have issued to her.</P>
      <P>On average, claims for carer's allowance are processed within 13 weeks. The additional delay in this case arose in obtaining details of the spouse's income from employment and, following his commencement of self-employment, his income from that source.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's request under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, for files and other information relating to this case, my Department has obtained written authority from the person concerned and also from the third party to whom the information relates in this</P>
      <P>case and all records have been released to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>At any one time there are a large number of applications for carer's allowance awaiting determination and my Department deals with all applications as quickly and efficiently as possible. Unless there are exceptional circumstances the Department does not give priority to any particular cases as this would mean additional delay for other claimants. Correspondence from the Deputy in relation to individual cases is also dealt with in the normal way. In this particular case I understand also that officials of my Department have been in regular contact with the Deputy's office and that he has been kept fully informed of developments.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed. I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>In determining entitlement to old age (non-contributory) pension account must be taken of all income, including UK or other pensions, for means assessment purposes. Under the Social Welfare Acts, pensioners are required to notify my Department of any change in circumstances which might affect their pension entitlement. The Department carries out periodic reviews in order to ensure that pensioners are receiving the correct rate of payment in accordance with their means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of old age (non-contributory) pension since 1991. Following a recent review of his claim it was found that his weekly means had increased to £76.91 as a result of increases in his British retirement pension and he had not notified the Department of this. His old age (non-contributory) pension is accordingly due to be revised downwards to £44.20 per week, comprised of a personal rate of £23.50 and an increase of £20.70 in respect of his spouse. The person concerned has been notified accordingly. However, as his spouse is over 66 years of age, she is entitled to claim a pension in her own right. An application form for old age (non-contributory) pension has been sent to her. In the event that the spouse is qualified to receive her own pension, then each of the couple would receive £25.50 per week or a combined weekly <Col N="534" /> payment of £51.00. One of the couple would also be entitled to an additional weekly payment of £5 free fuel allowance from the start of the fuel season in October. A decision will be made on the pension entitlements of the couple concerned as soon as the spouse returns the completed application form to the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 775, 776 and 780 together.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 3 July 2001. Following an examination of his case a deciding officer disallowed the claim on the grounds that he failed to disclose his means. In particular he failed to satisfy the Department as to his current circumstances and residency. The person concerned appealed the disallowance decision and all relevant papers were sent to the independent social welfare appeals office on 20 September 2001. The person concerned does not have sufficient contributions, paid and/or credited, in the governing contribution year (1999-2000) to qualify for payment of unemployment benefit at this time. He was asked to submit employers statements showing periods of employment in the 1999-2000 tax year with a view to reviewing his record for that year but no response has been received to date. The person concerned applied for disability benefit on 12 September 2001. He does not have sufficient contributions paid or credited to qualify for payment of disability benefit. Supplementary welfare allowance is in payment from 13 September 2001 at £78.00 per week. (£84.00 max. rate less £6.00 means).</P>

      <P>In determining entitlement to old age (non-contributory) pension account must be taken of all income, including UK or other pensions, for means assessment purposes. Under the Social Welfare Acts, pensioners are required on an ongoing basis to notify my Department of any change in circumstances which might affect their Irish pension entitlement. The Department also carries out periodic reviews to ensure that pensioners are receiving the correct rate of payment in accordance with their means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently receiving a reduced rate old age (non-contributory) pension of £67.50 per week, based on means of IR£33.73 per week derived from a British retirement pension. Following a recent review of his claim, his old age (non-contributory) pension will be reduced to £57.50 with effect from 5 October 2001. This reduction reflects a higher income of IR£44.00 per week from his British retirement pension since it was last assessed in 1997.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded an old age (non-contributory) pension at the maximum rate from February 1999 on the basis that he had no means. Following notification that he had been awarded a pension from another country from February 1999, which had not been disclosed, his means were re-assessed at £78.44 a week and it was accordingly decided that he was not entitled to old age pension from 16 February 2001 as his means exceeded the statutory limit at that time. Arising from the improvements provided for in budget 2001 it was decided that he was entitled to a reduced rate of pension of £21.50 per week from 6 April 2001. In addition, he has been awarded a living alone allowance of £6 per week and a fuel allowance of £5 per week from the same date. This is his correct entitlement having regard to his means as assessed. These decisions were made by a deciding officer against whose decisions the person concerned has a statutory right of appeal to an appeals officer. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant must satisfy a means test, and must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right. People who qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age (non-contributory) pension are accepted as satisfying the means-test. However, if the household includes a person who is in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit or occupational injury benefit then that household will not qualify for a fuel allowance. The benefit recipient could qualify for a £3 smokeless fuel allowance if they are residing in one of the specified areas and are on benefit for more than three months.</P>
      <P>In the case of contributory pensioners such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensioners who receive a qualified adult allowance, any income that their spouse has is assessable as means for the purpose of entitlement to a fuel allowance. With effect from 1 October 2001 a person may now have a combined household income of up to £40 per week or savings-investments of up to £30,000 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance. The individual in question is currently in receipt of a widower's contributory pension from my Department but there is no record of a claim for a fuel allowance from him. An application form has issued to him and if he feels that he may qualify for payment of a fuel allowance, the completed form should be returned to my Department immediately so that a decision on his entitlement can be made.</P>
      <P>Any further changes in eligibility for fuel allowances would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre. Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the <Col N="539" /> supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Under section 172(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, people in full-time education are not eligible to receive assistance, including rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>However, Article 7 of S.I. 382 of 1995 provides for a number of exceptions to this exclusion. Persons participating in approved courses under the back to education allowance scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their relevant social welfare payment and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, which may have been in payment prior to participating on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups including lone parents who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. To qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least 6 months and be at least 21 years of age or 18 years of age for recipients of blind person's pension and disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The review of the one-parent family payment published in September 2000 highlighted the poor standard of education of this group with early school leaving a particular problem. To encourage and assist them to return to the school system I introduced changes in budget 2001 to the back to education scheme. From this year a lower qualifying age limit of 18 years will apply to recipients of the one-parent family allowance who have been on the payment for at least six months and who have been out of the educational system for two years.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 788 and 823 together.</P>
      <P>There are more than 111,000 people receiving support through an old age (non-contributory) pension or widow/er's (non-contributory) pension from my Department, at an aggregate cost of over £472 million in 2001 and 10,300 of these people are receiving this pension as a supplement to their British retirement pension income.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement to old age (non-contributory) and widow/er's (non-contributory) pension, the Social Welfare Acts specify that account must be taken of all income, including British or other pensions, for means assessment purposes. Under this legislation, pensioners are required to notify my Department of any change in circumstances which might affect their pension entitlement. Where they do not do so the result is that they receive higher amounts of Irish pension than they are entitled to. The value of British retirement pension for Irish-resident recipients has increased in recent years directly through increases in rates of payment and indirectly through a beneficial sterling rate relative to the Irish pound.</P>
      <P>In the context of reviews of pension entitlements British retirement pension income is assessed for means purposes using the sterling to euro rate of exchange either at the date of the last increase in British pension or the rate of exchange in subsequent quarters, whichever is most beneficial to the pensioner. Because there would be a number of factors in the reviews giving rise to changes in rates of pension it is not possible to quantify precisely the number of pensioners whose pension is altered as a result of the change in the value of sterling nor the net savings resulting from currency changes.</P>
      <P>Any pensioner who experiences a revised decision on their entitlements have the right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. It is also open to them at any stage to request the Department to review their means if their circumstances change, eg, if the value of their other income drops.</P>

    <P>Since September 1999 the number of persons in receipt of unemployment payments has dropped from 169,430 to 123,772. This represents a decrease of 45,658 or almost 27%. The main reasons for this significant decline are the additional job opportunities being created by the buoyant economy and the wide range of active labour market programmes targeted at the unemployed. The number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance declined by 44,069, or 39%, during this period. The proportion of persons long-term unemployed has dropped from 48% in June 1997 to 42% in September 1999 and 35% currently. This represents significant progress in the ongoing efforts to combat marginalisation and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The numbers of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit has remained relatively more stable over the period in question. The numbers of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit is, a function of, <i>inter alia</i> total participation levels in the labour market. The total labour force was 1,736,100 in September 1999 and stood at 1,779,100 in September 2000. While the rates of decrease in the total number of persons receiving <Col N="542" /> unemployment payments have slowed somewhat in recent months following the impact of foot and mouth disease precautions and the general economic slowdown, I am confident that Government policies will ensure continued reduction in the numbers unemployed, in particular the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was recently awarded carer's allowance with effect from 12 July 2001 at the maximum weekly rate of £132.80 in respect of his care of both his parents. However, my Department understands that, since the award, one of the parents has died. Where a person being cared for dies and is not the spouse-partner of the carer, payment will continue to that carer for six weeks after the death. The person concerned will continue to receive payment for six weeks after the death, until 31 October 2001. With effect from 1 November 2001 his carer's allowance will reduce to £88.50 per week which represents the maximum rate payable to a carer looking after one care recipient.</P>

Details provided by her when applying for maternity benefit indicate that she had been employed in the United Kingdom from 26 November 1996 to 16 July 2000. Contributions paid in another EU country may be combined to enable a person to qualify for maternity benefit. Her British social insurance record was requested on 8 May 2001. A response from the Department of Social Security was received on 3 September, 2001 requiring further information in relation to her employment in the United Kingdom.

      <P>The person concerned was refused carer's allowance in September 1998 on the basis that her means which were derived from her spouse's earnings, exceeded the statutory limit. Her application was recently re-examined arising from further improvements made to the carer's allowance means test which were introduced as part of budget 2001. However, her weekly means were re-assessed at £169.10 per week and still remain in excess of the statutory limit for receipt of carer's allowance. Accordingly her application for carer's allowance was refused. She was notified on 21 September 2001 of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>To qualify for participation in the students summer jobs scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to the means test which applies to applicants for unemployment assistance. In assessing means, account is taken of the parents' gross income less income tax, PRSI, superannuation, private health insurance, union fees, rent or mortgage payments and some travel costs. The weekly means of the student are then assessed at 17% of the net family income calculated on this basis. In the case of the persons concerned the weekly means were calculated on the basis of details of the income from employment of the father and mother. The means were assessed at £82.79, which exceeds the means limit of £65 for <Col N="544" /> entitlement to this allowance. Details of the calculations involved are being forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of our pre-election commitments, I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. Both these measures took effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>The enhanced child benefit rates payable in the case of twins and other multiple births, give an appropriate level of recognition within the child benefit scheme of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them and fully implement the commitment made in this regard. The Deputy will be aware that it has been a priority of this Government to invest heavily in the child benefit scheme as a means of easing the financial burden of rearing children. The very significant increases in child benefit rates provided for in budget 2001, which raised the level for the first two children by £25 per month and for the third and subsequent children by £30 per month, came into effect in June.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on child benefit is now over £900 million per year. Moreover, the Government is committed to delivering similar increases in the next two budgets, bringing investment in the scheme up to a total of some £1.5 billion in a full year by 2003. By then the additional annual cost of providing for double child benefit payments for twins would be an estimated £19.5 million. The question of providing any further enhancement of the arrangements for twins under the child benefit scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and other competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The one parent family payment or OFP is my Department's main support payment for lone parents including those who are unmarried, separated or divorced and a small number of widowed people with dependent children who do not qualify for the widow/ers contributory pension. In common with other social assistance schemes the payment is means-tested in order to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. The rate of payment of the OFP is £85.50 per week with an increase of £15.20 per week for each qualified child. The personal rate of payment is the same as most other social assistance payments. The child dependent allowance is higher than that paid under some schemes but not as high as others, with overall rates paid under under the social welfare system ranging from £13.20 to £17 per week.</P>
      <P>Lone parents are recognised as one of the groups in our society who are most at risk of poverty. It is also generally accepted that the most effective route out of poverty is through paid employment. Because of their situation lone parents can face particular difficulties and expenses in participating in training or taking up employment. Accordingly, the OFP means test contains concessions, not available under other schemes, in relation to earned income. An OFP recipient may earn up to £115.38 per week without affecting her-his payment with 50% of earnings from £115.38 to £230.76 assesed as means. These concessions recognise the particular difficulties faced by lone parents in accessing training-employment and are designed to encourage them to consider employment as an alternative to long-term welfare dependency.</P>
      <P>Married and cohabiting couples are also, when necessary, supported through the social welfare system. Women or men who have withdrawn from the labour force and who are engaged on home duties are provided for in the social welfare system through the payment of qualified adult allowances where their spouse-partner is in receipt of a social welfare payment. This allowance is paid at less than the personal rate to take account of the economies of scale where people live together. In accordance with research undertaken by the ESRI for the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes the Government is committed to raising these allowances to 70% of the full personal rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> In general, lone parents receive the same payments as other social welfare recipients in similar positions. However, because of the high risk of poverty faced by lone parents there are specific policy measures aimed at them, particularly in the area of encouraging them into employment. The appropriateness of these policies and their effectiveness in achieving their objectives are kept under review.</P>

      <P>Subject to the usual qualifying conditions, child dependant allowances are normally payable in respect of qualified children up to 18 years of age. In addition, where a student is aged 18 or over, the child dependant allowance is payable following completion of second-level education or the leaving certificate, during the three month period when the student is disqualified from receipt of unemployment assistance. These arrangements apply to both short-term and long-term schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> In the case of long-term payments such as pensions, where the qualified child remains in full-time education, the child dependant element can continue up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. At present these arrangements do not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The Government is committed to extending these arrangements to all social welfare recipients where the child is aged under 22 and in full-time education within the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, perhaps he will get in touch with me and I can arrange to have the matter examined.</P>

Of these, 15 work on a full-time basis, two are job sharing and there are none working on a part-time basis or on flexi-time.

      <P>The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. The main objectives of the schemes are to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their <Col N="548" /> wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society. A person may receive a payment under the free schemes if they are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, other qualifying payments or are aged 66 or over and satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>The free schemes are seen by many as a recognition of older people's contribution to society, most particularly the free travel scheme, which is universally available to those aged over 66 years. As the Deputy is aware, I extended entitlement to the free schemes to all people aged 70 and over regardless of their income or household composition.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the national fuel scheme is different to that of the free schemes and is designed to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. In order to receive a payment a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or health board payment and satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>While there are some similarities in the operation of the free schemes and the national fuel scheme in so far as they both perform an income maintenance function there are significant differences in the objectives of the schemes, as outlined above, which in turn means different qualification criteria apply to each scheme. I recognise the importance of fuel allowance to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. However, the question of aligning the qualifying conditions for fuel allowance and free schemes has to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others. In this regard I do not intend introducing an age element in the qualification criteria for the national fuel scheme</P>

      <P>Disablement benefit is payable to persons who have sustained an occupational injury or prescribed occupational disease. It is paid in addition to primary income support payments such as disability benefit, invalidity pension and to persons who may have returned to employment.</P>

    <P>Disablement benefit recipients are currently paid by cheque. While there is no current facility for the payment of this benefit by electronic fund transfer, an alternative facility exists whereby a <Col N="549" /> cheque can be issued to a customer's bank where it is lodged directly into their account. Currently there are 500 of a total of 12,000 customers who avail of this particular payment method.</P>
    <P>My overall aim is to ensure that the most modern and widest range of payment methods are available to my Department's customers and to provide access to new services and facilities as they become available in the money transmission market so as to ensure that my Department's customers can choose the service which best suits their personal needs and preferences.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash;  scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which people are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation cost. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that he is in receipt of the maximum amount of rent supplement payable to someone in his circumstances. Details of how the amount of rent supplement in payment was calculated are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>

Following completion of the necessary enquiries, a living alone allowance of £6 per week has been awarded to him with effect from 27 July 2001. A fuel allowance of £5 a week has also been awarded to him, payable from the start of the heating season in October 2001. A payment order book containing these allowances has been issued to the person's nominated post office for collection by him. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear &ndash; BSCF &ndash; allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance or SWA scheme. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year. An allowance of £63 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</P>
      <P>A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain prescribed levels. Details of the income levels, which vary depending on the composition of the household, are shown in the attached tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income limit of £250 to which the Deputy refers applies only to people making the transition from welfare to work through employment <Col N="551" /> or education schemes, such as the back to work allowance. The same income limit applies in these cases to a number of secondary benefits such as BSCF and rent supplement. The objective is to give people an incentive to take up places on such schemes and to remove the difficulty that some people lost entitlement to the BSCF allowance when they took up such places. It was necessary to ease the means test in these cases to ensure that people are to be better off working than on social welfare. The means test for the BSCF allowance is being examined in a review of the scheme being undertaken as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is examining all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I am expecting delivery of the group's final report shortly. Any recommendations for changes in the operation of the the scheme will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>To qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance a person must be unemployed, available for, capable of and genuinely seeking employment. To satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is genuinely seeking employment, an applicant is expected to take reasonable steps which are regarded as offering the best prospect of obtaining employment. This may be done by registering with FÁS, writing to employers, answering advertisments including advertisments in the local or regional papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> The location of any prospective employment and the level of qualifications which might be required would be taken into account in determining whether it is reasonable for a person not to apply or make themselves available for particular jobs. The Department is concerned at all times to treat claimants fairly and reasonably having regard to their circumstances. Where, however, a deciding officer is not satisfied that a person is genuinely seeking work then the claim would be disallowed on those grounds.</P>
    <P>If the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the deciding officer it is open to him/her to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. All applicants and claimants for unemployment benefit or assistance are required to satisfy all conditions for receipt of payment, and those in the Cork area are not treated any differently to other claimants in that regard.</P>

      <P>The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are as follows: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society. The original objective of the telephone allowance was to provide an element of protection and security in their own homes for older people and people with disabilities who were either living alone or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency. A secondary objective of the scheme was to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
      <P>The free schemes act as an important support to encouraging care in the community. The proposal to extend telephone allowance to pensioners resident in nursing homes does not fit easily within the community care objectives of these schemes. Persons resident in nursing homes may already be in receipt of State support, either through the public health system or through a nursing home subvention. In addition, those living in nursing homes and other residential institutions have daily support and contact with other residents and nursing staff.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for a telephone allowance on two occasions but was refused as she resides in a nursing home. The current arrangements for the free schemes are kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

The legislative initiative will involve the transfer of responsibility for these programmes and services from the Department to the new agency.</P>
      <P>A number of technical and practical details have been identified for resolution in consultation with the family and community resource centres and their support agencies to ensure the smooth transition of responsibility for support for the family and community resource centres programme to the new agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CAN is one of a number of support agencies which has been invited at my request to meet <Col N="554" /> officials of my Department to discuss these details and the issues raised in their letter. It is with disappointment that I have learned that CAN postponed the meeting with officials planned for 17 September. I understand that contact has again been made with CAN and it is hoped that the organisation will be in a position to respond to the invitation to meet officials at an early date.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring the Family Support Agency Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas at an early date.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who is in receipt of an invalidity pension, has a standard free travel pass. Under the rules of the free travel scheme, she could only qualify for a companion pass if she were confined to a wheelchair, if carer's allowance were being paid in respect of her, if she were blind or severely visually impaired, or if she previously held a companion pass and was receipt of a disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The Department has reviewed the application of the person concerned but, as she does not satisfy any of the criteria for entitlement to a companion free travel pass at present, her application had to be refused. The question of extending entitlement to the free travel companion pass to categories other than those precluded at present would be a matter for consideration in a budgetory context.</P>

      <P>Work is well in hand in the Department to effect a smooth changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002. The principle underpinning this Department's approach is that customers will not lose out on the changeover process. Accordingly, customers will be paid in Irish pounds to 31 December 2001 and automatically in euro from 1 January 2002. A formal project board has been in place since late 1998 at senior official level to oversee euro changeover work. Staff have been assigned exclusively to the project, and a specific Euro Transition and Test <Col N="555" /> Office has been set up to co-ordinate the necessary preparatory work on IT and business matters. The Department is pursuing a concerted and targeted information campaign designed to ensure social welfare customer awareness of the implications for them of the changeover to euro. The information campaign is being conducted in close consultation with the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland or ECBI and pays particular attention to the needs of the hardest to reach categories, such as people with disabilities and those with low literacy skills. A range of media are being used &ndash; print, radio and electronic &ndash; to heighten awareness among the Department's customers.</P>
      <P>An information leaflet entitled &ldquo;Social Welfare the euro and You&rdquo; (SW103) was launched in June 2001 to complement the material in the SW99 &ldquo;Social Welfare and the euro&rdquo; which issued in February 1999. Both of these leaflets are available in the Department's local offices and through the usual outlets for social welfare information. In addition to this, in August, copies of the SW103 were issued to some 520,000 recipients of child benefit.</P>
      <P>Since mid-2000 new payment award letters issuing to long-term claimants include the amount payable in both Irish pounds and euro. A magazine entitled &ldquo;Changing for a Changing Ireland&rdquo; issued in June-July 2001 to 1.4 million households about DSCFA services and featured a full page of euro information.</P>
      <P>A specific euro mailshot to old age and disability/invalidity customers has just been issued. It is planned to issue a further euro mailshot to all customers in November. Also, 321,000 social welfare customers will, this week, receive payment books which contain orders payable in Irish pounds up to 31 December 2001 and include new euro orders payable from 1 January 2002. This latest renewal brings the number of euro inclusive books issued to over one million. Some 700,000 customers already received euro inclusive renewal books this year. By the end of the year all departmental information leaflets and claim forms will be in dual display format.</P>
      <P>Where appropriate, replies to parliamentary questions involving monetary amounts will be shown in euro and Irish pounds.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for an <Col N="556" /> old age (contributory) pension a person must have entered social insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have a minimum number of paid contributions on their record and have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the date of entry into social insurance, if later. A yearly average of 48 contributions is required for a full rate pension.</P>
      <P>In general self employed contributors have their average contributions for pension purposes assessed on the same basis as other contributors. However, special arrangements were put in place to cater for those who were already self employed when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group in 1988. A self-employed person who became a contributor on 6 April 1988 and who at any time prior to that date was an employed contributor can have their earlier record disregarded if it is to their advantage. Persons who became self employed contributors after 6 April 1988 have their average contributions assessed in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) pension are at present being reviewed. One of the key issues being addressed as part of this review involves the possibility of a change in the method of assessment from the current one based on average contributions to a system based on the total number of contributions paid-credited over a person's working life. This represents a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy but it is considered that such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by claimants.</P>
      <P>A working group comprising officials of the Department and the Department of Finance is at present undertaking this review and it is expected that the working group's report will be available for consideration later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance or SWA scheme allows for payment of a weekly or monthly supplement to be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. My Department eliminated cash payments from its local offices during the 1990s and customers were transferred to alternative methods of payment. The non-cash payment <Col N="557" /> methods currently in use include cheques, personalised payable orders &ndash; PPOs, postdrafts, which are similar to cheques, electronic funds transfer or EFT to accounts at banks, post offices and certain other financial institutions, and electronic information transfer or EIT &ndash; the transfer of payment information by computer tape to An Post which then processes the payments at post offices.</P>
      <P>The SWA scheme is administered by the health boards through the community welfare officers at the local health centres around the country. As is the case with my Department, cash payments have been removed from these offices for some time and payment is made by way of one of the payment methods set out above.</P>
      <P>The removal of cash from these front line offices has provided a two fold benefit. First, it reduces the requirement for people to attend the relevant office each week/month in order to collect their money. Second, the removal of cash from the offices has reduced the number of &ldquo;cash outlets&rdquo; serving social welfare customers thus lowering security requirements in relation to cash-in-transit and cash holding arrangements etc. This strategy has had a beneficial impact on the operations of the offices concerned. There have been improvements in the quality and delivery of service to customers.</P>
      <P>I accept that the demand for rented accommodation in many areas is such that prospective tenants sometimes find it difficult to secure accommodation. I am aware that some landlords state that they are unwilling to accept rent supplement cheques but I understand that the issue is not the payment instrument itself but rather a reluctance to rent their properties to people who qualify for SWA rent supplement, regardless of how that is paid.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, re-introducing cash payments would not contribute to dealing with those difficulties. In any event, I feel it would be a backward step to re-introduce cash payments.</P>
      <P>Apart from the security issues involved with handling cash, the quality and delivery of services would suffer. For these reasons I have no plans to restore cash to the list of methods of payment currently in use.</P>

    <P>In addition, I also brought forward, in 2001, the date of increases in child benefit by three months, from September to June.

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear or BSCF allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance or SWA scheme.

      <P>The free travel scheme is generally available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services within the State. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin in April last year, considered that the primary objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active within the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care. Extending the scheme to cover travel within other EU states is clearly outside the scope and objective of the scheme.</P>
      <P>At EU level, a report &lsquo;Towards a Senior Euro Pass', was commissioned by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission and published by Age Concern, England at the end of 1997. This report recommends that EU states should establish a senior euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities. However, I understand that further work on this issue has been suspended at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior euro pass, which is a completely separate scheme to my Department's free travel scheme, is to submit observations, as required, in conjunction with other Departments, statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals in this report, in so far as they affect the business of this Department. The administration of the euro pass itself is outside the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme, in common with the other free schemes operated by this Department, will be kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the fact that many recipients of maternity leave payment lose out in view of the fact that the amount of maternity leave payment is related to salary in the 'governing tax year' and in view of wage increases in recent times.</Quest>

      <P>The weekly social insurance benefits are, in general, paid on a flat-rate basis and comprise a personal allowance, together with additions for qualified adults and children. However, the maternity benefit scheme differs from other weekly social welfare payments in that it is an earnings-related benefit, but subject to a minimum and maximum payment. The purpose of this payment is to provide women with an adequate income during the maternity leave period.</P>
      <P>The level of maternity benefit is set at 70% of the woman's gross weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year, subject to a minimum payment of £98.70 a week and a maximum payment of £183 a week. For current claims the relevant income tax year is 6 April 1999 to 5 April 2000. It should be noted that, unlike other social welfare payments, maternity benefit is not taxable. In addition, if the employer does not pay any wages for the duration of the maternity leave period, then the woman will generally be entitled to an income tax refund for that period. All of these factors combine to produce an income during maternity leave which will broadly equate to the woman's current net weekly earnings, subject to a maximum upper ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If social insurance payments such as maternity benefit were to be made fully earnings-related then this would involve a substantial increase in expenditure on these schemes. This in turn would require a significant increase in the current levels of PRSI contribution payable in order to fund <Col N="562" /> these benefits. Increases in the level of social welfare payments payable, including maternity benefit, are matters for consideration by the Government in the context of the formulation of the annual budget package, having regard to available resources and in the light of the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>Because of the increasing number of non-nationals looking for information and other services from my Department, the need for translation facilities in my Department's offices is increasing.</P>
      <P>To address the translation needs in local offices a number of pilot projects are being developed. One of these involves training staff locally in certain core languages to provide an on the spot translation service. A second approach involves providing a readily accessible translation service. In this instance, the information services in my Department have made arrangements with a company to provide a translation service. The company in question provides a quick and efficient translation service over the phone. It is intended to extend the translation pilot scheme to a second office shortly.</P>
      <P>Evaluation of the service will be conducted to establish what is the most efficient and effective way to provide this service so that appropriate arrangements can be made whenever they are required. It is my objective to ensure that my Department delivers the highest quality service to all its customers and that the special needs of refugees and other categories are effectively addressed.</P>

      <P>The Brendan Kennelly Cultural Centre in Ballylongford made application for funding under the ACCESS scheme but it was not recommended for grant aid by the advisory committee which evaluated all applications, and, therefore, was not included in the list of projects put before me for consideration. The ACCESS scheme attracted great interest and was oversubscribed with 180 project promoters seeking grant aid in the order of £224 million. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that with ACCESS funding restricted to £36 million, difficult decisions had to be taken, and many worthwhile projects had to be omitted from the final list.</P>

Officials from my Department have been in contact with the association and have agreed a contribution to assist in covering their costs. It is agreed that the medieval wall is in need of some repair. The growth on the wall will be removed shortly and conservation works will be carried out as soon as resources permit.</P>

I understand that this legal issue remains unresolved and it is not possible, therefore, to give a date when the transfer of the church will be completed. In the interim, I will investigate the possibility of taking the property into my guardianship, pending the transfer of title. Any further action on my part must await clarification of title.</P>

Any conditions necessary in order to ensure that damage to the conservation value of the site is avoided or kept to a minimum are agreed with the landowners in question. Site information packs have been issued to all known landowners, and procedures relating to the continuation of turf cutting for a period up to ten years in areas already being cut were also outlined in my press release of 3 February 1999.</P>
      <P>It is the practice of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to consult with landowners before undertaking maintenance works deemed essential to conserve bogs on lands within SACs that are not State-owned.</P>

      <P>My Department has taken the following steps to ensure a smooth transition of all of its operations to the euro:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> 1.Euro changeover plan</P>
    <P>My Department has prepared a euro changeover plan in which critical tasks and dates are outlined. This plan covers items such as accounting systems, salaries-wages and receipts</P>
    <P>2.Internal committee on the euro</P>
    <P>An internal committee on the euro was established in 2000. This committee, which meets monthly, is chaired at assistant secretary level, and has representatives from all the divisions within my Department which will be affected by the euro.</P>
    <P>3.External reporting</P>
    <P>My Department is represented at monthly meetings chaired by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland of the single currency officers team &ndash; SCOT &ndash; where issues affecting all Government Departments are discussed and resolved.</P>
    <P>4.Accounting systems and payroll</P>
    <P>All conversion programmes for the accounts payable have been completed and euro testing is now in progress. All cheques issued to suppliers show the euro equivalent amount on the counterfoil. The salaries system has been converted to COREPAY and my Department, in recently going live on the euro version, was one of the first to do so. A simple ready reckoner, which will do conversions for euro and punts, was included in all pay cheque envelopes. Testing in regard to the euro compliance of the industrial wages system has commenced.</P>
    <P>5.Bodies under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>All bodies under my Department's aegis have responded positively to a questionnaire in relation to their preparation for the euro and my Department is satisfied that their preparations are on target. Progress in the bodies is being monitored through the internal euro committee.</P>
    <P>6.Services to the public, admission charges and signage</P>
    <P>In line with the national voluntary code of practice for euro changeover, all prices will have dual display from 1 October 2001 until 9 March 2002. Many publications already have dual display of price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 846, 931 and 940 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problems to which the Deputies refer and I sympathise with the communities which have been adversely affected. I would like to emphasise at the outset that Traveller organisations themselves deplore the anti-social behaviour of some groups of Travellers because such behaviour damages the reputation of all Travellers.</P>
      <P>In the interests of clarity I will outline the current legal position in relation to trespass. Trespass is a civil wrong and, for the most part, falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. In broad terms, that civil wrong may be defined as consisting of intentionally or negligently entering or remaining on, or directly causing anything to come into contact with, land in the possession of another without lawful justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain circumstances, trespass may be dealt with under criminal law. The criminal law provisions dealing with trespass include a range of offences under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. The 1971 Act makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land, or remain in forcible occupation or to <Col N="577" /> encourage or advocate the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation. &ldquo;Forcibly&rdquo; in the context of the 1971 Act means using or threatening to use force in relation to person or property, and for this purpose participation in action or conduct with others in numbers or circumstances calculated to prevent by intimidation the exercise by any person of his rights in relation to any property shall constitute a threat to use force, and the Act also states that &ldquo;forcible&rdquo; is to be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act makes it an offence for a person to enter a building, or part of it, as a trespasser, or to be in its vicinity for the purpose of trespassing thereon in circumstances giving rise to the reasonable inference that such entry or presence was with intent to commit an offence or to unlawfully interfere with any property situated there. It is also an offence for any person to trespass on any such place in such manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person, and the Garda has power to direct a person to desist from acting in such a manner and-or to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner. It is an offence for any person to fail to comply with such a direction from the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that the problem of trespass by Traveller encampments is a problem involving complex social and cultural issues and is not a problem which can be dealt with by the criminal law acting in isolation. In this respect, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibilities on two fronts in relation to this issue. In my justice role I must ensure that public order is maintained and in my equality role I have responsibility to ensure that Travellers receive equality of treatment taking into account their way of life. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has an important role to play in relation to the issue that is at the heart of the Deputies' questions, that is, the responsibility that is on each local authority under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998 to have regard for the need for transient sites, as identified in its assessment of need, in preparing its Traveller accommodation programme.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the serious effects which unofficial halting sites can have on local communities and I would not therefore rule out the possibility that I might at some appropriate stage bring forward new criminal law provisions in this area. However, the matter requires careful consideration and debate. In June 1998, I established a committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the Traveller community. The committee, which is chaired by my Department, is representative of Traveller interests, social partners and relevant Government Departments. In the light of recent incidents of the type referred to by the Deputies, and in the light of a number of suggestions that the criminal law be further developed to deal with such incidents, I have <Col N="578" /> asked that the issue of trespass by Traveller dealers and traders be discussed by the committee, and I understand that the issue will be on the agenda for the October meeting of the committee. I will keep the matter under review, in particular in the light of the outcome of the committee's discussion of this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under rule 78 of the 1947 Rules for the Government of Prisons, the governor may have &ldquo;a refractory or violent prisoner detained in a cladded-padded cell for his-her own protection.&rdquo;  Similarly, the prison doctor may authorise the detention of an offender in the cladded-padded cell for medical observation or for the offenders own protection if he-she has suicidal tendencies. Obviously, while undesirable, it is a matter of practical necessity to put some prisoners in a place of safety within the prison system when they prove difficult to manage in the general prison population. Padded cells are sometimes used in such instances as they provide a secure, safe place where prisoners can remain under special observation with minimal opportunity to cause damage to themselves or to other prisoners.</P>
      <P>Prisoners may be confined to such cells as may be approved by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but only on the authority of the governor or other officer in charge, and for as short a period as necessary. The guidelines in place for the use of padded cells require all such placements to be reported to Prisons Service headquarters and the early involvement of the prison doctor where a stay in the padded cell has to be used. It should also be noted that, on many occasions, placement in a padded cell is at the prisoner's own request.</P>
      <P>The document &ldquo;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&rdquo; which was published earlier this year by the Irish Penal Reform Trust &ndash; IPRT &ndash; called for the elimination of the use of padded cells within the prison system and I would like to make a few observations on this report. The finding in the report that 78% of prisoners placed in padded cells are suffering from mental illness is apparently based exclusively on the comments and observations in prison registers of the use of such cells. Most of these entries, which are brief and situation-related, are made by prison officers who would not have a professional qualification in the area of assessing or diagnosing mental illness. The classification by the trust's report of such cases as &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; is, to say the least, unscientific. The decision as to whether a prisoner is in need of treatment for a psychiatric disorder is a matter for the medical personnel in our penal institutions. Such a decision can only be taken following medical assessment and diagnosis.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the IPRT document does not differentiate between strip cell usage and padded cell usage. Padded cells are used for the protection of the prisoner, as opposed to disciplinary or good order purposes. The IPRT document does not make this clear and, instead, gives the impression that punishment is the routine rationale for such use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do, however, accept that there are indications that an increasing number of vulnerable and mentally disordered people are being committed to prison. In this regard, there is a risk that prison may be used as a refuge of last resort by the <Col N="580" /> courts for some mentally disordered people who may be charged with offences of a public order nature which are a by-product of their illness. It would obviously be beneficial if such minor offenders could be diverted in the direction of medical treatment either on an out-patient basis in the community or in extremes into a hospital setting until their condition stabilises. In this context, the report of the group to review the organisation and structure of prison health services was recently received by me and published on 27 September 2001. This fundamental review contains a number of recommendations on the issue of psychiatric services for prisoners. One such recommendation is that mental health legislation should be introduced in a way that would facilitate diversion of mentally disordered individuals to an alternative, treatment, supervision and care service. I have requested the Director General of the Prisons Service to pursue the recommendations outlined in this report with the other interests involved with a view to ensuring that the necessary measures are taken to improve the health care available to prisoners. I can also inform the House that there is a review under way at present on the future service role of the Central Mental Hospital. I am awaiting the outcome of this review.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have taken the view that if a prisoner is psychiatrically assessed as in need of psychiatric treatment then that treatment ought to be provided in a psychiatric hospital. That policy conforms generally to the policy in other European jurisdictions and to the policy advocated by the relevant organs of the Council of Europe. However, all of the recommendations contained in the Irish Penal Reform Trust report will be carefully considered. The Director General of the Prisons Service, in this context, met a deputation from the trust earlier in the year and they discussed their report and recommendations with him at some length.</P>

      <P>In general, the funding of support facilities for the families of missing persons is not a function that would normally fall within my functional remit. However, in deference to previously expressed concerns on this matter, I have already instructed my Department to examine the possibility of how this may be brought about and, in this regard, it is currently in discussions with a separate voluntary organisation. Finally, I would wish to point out that approximately 99% of reported missing persons in any given year are located by year end and only a very small proportion of persons who go missing do so in circumstances which would be of concern to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I have received legal advice to the effect that a provision in primary legislation is necessary to transpose EC Directive 98/5 on the right of establishment of lawyers, in addition to regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972. Accordingly, I have included an appropriate amendment to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998 &ndash; currently awaiting Committee Stage in this House, having been passed by the Seanad  &ndash; among the amendments which were recently circulated to Deputies. The quantity of legislation emanating from my Department has unfortunately held up progress on this Bill in the House but I hope that it can be enacted in the current session. This will enable me to make the necessary regulations to give full effect to the directive. The European Commission has been informed of the reason for the delay in transposing the directive.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this dealing refers to an application under section 49 &ndash; acquisition of title by virtue of long possession &ndash; of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 which was lodged on 9 April 2001. I am further informed that a reply to the queries of 21 August 2001 was received on 25 September 2001. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49 which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners can take some time to process. Accordingly, although it is not possible to estimate a precise completion date at this stage, I can assure the Deputy that the matter is receiving attention.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that on the night of 25 August 2001, about 300 people congregated on the beach between Laytown and Gormanstown where rave type music was played.</P>
      <P>Subsequent Garda inquiries revealed that this rave was advertised on the Internet and by way of mobile text messages. On learning of the event, a Garda public order unit was dispatched from the Slane concert to assist local personnel who had gone to the scene. A small amount of drugs was seized from some people who were on their way to the event and gardaí maintained a presence until all persons had left the beach and dispersed. I am further informed that Laytown Garda station is manned each day until 1 a.m. In addition, the area is patrolled by mobile units from Drogheda. As with all other Garda stations, the personnel strength at Laytown is kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the circumstances surrounding the death of the person concerned is the subject of an ongoing investigation and that, although this investigation is progressing as expeditiously as possible, it cannot be stated when it will be concluded. I am further informed that the results of a second post mortem carried out on the body of the deceased are not yet available. In any event, however, it is not established practice that results of post mortems would be forwarded to my Department; rather, they are forwarded in the first instance to the Garda authorities and, where appropriate, to the Director of Public Prosecutions as part of the investigation file. Accordingly, the question of publication by me of such results does not arise.</P>

Applications to the Probate Office, including personal applications have at all times attracted court fees under the various Supreme Court and High Court (Fees) Orders. Current fees are charged pursuant to the Supreme Court and High Court (Fees) Order, 2001, which came into effect on 16 July 2001. This fees order did not introduce any new fees for applications to the Probate Office. If the Deputy wishes to provide further details of the application to which he refers in his question to the Courts Service, including the name, address, the date of death of the deceased and when the application was made, the Courts Service will make full inquiries as to the fees paid in this case and will reply directly to the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 92, 93 and 95 of today's date. These questions arise in the aftermath of the evil attacks on the people of the United States. This House has already made clear its abhorrence of what occurred. I am grateful to the Deputies who tabled these questions to have the opportunity to outline subsequent developments in so far as my areas of responsibility are concerned.</P>
      <P>The threat of major terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. In so far as the Garda</P>
      <P>Síochána is concerned, it maintains and fosters mutual assistance and co-operation with police forces and security services world-wide to ensure an effective flow of intelligence relevant to the task. A heightened state of security awareness is in effect at vital strategic locations following on from the tragic events of 11 September. It would, however, as the Deputies will appreciate, be inappropriate to comment on the specifics of such security arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Garda for a number of years has maintained surveillance on a number of non-nationals whose activities were considered to warrant it. The surveillance will, of course, continue but the House, again, will appreciate that I could not appropriately say anything further about this matter. In so far as the current world wide investigations into the recent atrocities in the United States are concerned, the Garda is assisting in the investigations and it would not be prudent to comment on specific aspects of them at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Justice and Home Affairs Council met on Thursday, 20 September 2001 to take the necessary measures to maintain the highest level of security and any other measure needed to combat terrorism. The council decided to harness all the measures already adopted at European Union level, in particular: the 1995 and 1996 conventions on extradition between the member states; the setting up of Europol and Pro-Eurojust; the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000; and the setting up of the EU police chiefs task force. Notwithstanding these measures, the seriousness of recent events has led <Col N="594" /> to the speeding up of the process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice and to the stepping up of co-operation with partners, especially the United States.</P>
    <P>To this end, the council adopted a number of measures to step up the fight against terrorism within the European Union and to improve co-operation with the United States. There are more than 40 such measures and I will mention some of the principal ones: the thorough examination of two Commission proposals for framework decisions, one on the approximation of member states' criminal laws with a view to establishing a common definition of a terrorist act and laying down common criminal sanctions, the other on the creation of a European arrest warrant; the early ratification of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal matters between member states of the European Union; Pro-Eurojust to bring together member states' magistrates specialising in counter-terrorism to examine the co-ordination of terrorism investigations; the police chiefs task force to discuss improved operational co-operation between member states and third countries and to co-ordinate measures implemented in member states to guarantee security, including in the field of air safety; Europol to analyse and report on the terrorist threat; the early ratification by member states of the relevant conventions to prevent and combat the financing of terrorism; the strengthening of border controls; and increased co-operation and closer consultations with the United States in all competent international fora and especially a more active role for the Union within the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In a separate but closely related development, the Security Council of the United Nations has adopted a wide-ranging, comprehensive resolution obliging member states to take steps and implement strategies to combat international terrorism, especially in relation to the financing or support of terrorism. Some of the measures raise difficult and complex issues and will require careful, albeit urgent, scrutiny. Examination of the various proposals has commenced both here at home and in the EU institutions. As regards one of the measures, the early ratification by member states of the relevant conventions to prevent and combat the financing of terrorism, the Government yesterday approved the signature by Ireland of the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. A number of the proposals will inevitably require legislation and as soon as the measures are finalised I will bring proposals to Government. I should also inform the House that in addition to measures arising at an international level I am also reviewing our domestic law to see whether any changes may be necessary in the light of the events which have taken place. While the Garda Síochána has a role to play in dealing with national emergencies, the issue of facilities and equipment to cope with chemical or biological attacks is a matter for a number of agencies. At present, the issue of <Col N="595" /> guidelines for emergency services in dealing with the threat of attacks using chemical or biological agents is being addressed by an interdepartmental committee under the co-ordination of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The shocking events of 11 September clearly require an urgent, comprehensive and measured response. In so far as my areas of responsibility are concerned, I hope that I have been able to demonstrate to the House that that response is well under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was a study on assistance to drug users in European Union prisons. The statistics contained in this study were compiled from a variety of sources over recent years rather than as a result of a consistent survey at a particular time across all the prison systems listed. Data for some of the countries examined dates back as far as 1993. I would also make the point that in comparing statistics such as these, it is necessary to examine the entire situation, including the proportion of the prison populations with a history of drug use prior to imprisonment. If this proportion is low, then the possibility of drug abuse within the prison system will be lessened. In light of this, I must query the accuracy of the suggestion in the question that the Irish prison system was the third worst of all the countries examined.</P>
      <P>In any event and in line with my directions to the organisation in the matter, the Prisons Service is resolutely committed to tackling the problem of drug abuse in the custodial setting in a comprehensive way. In addition to the progressive introduction of measures to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons, the Prisons Service will continue to seek to reduce demand for drugs within the prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders.</P>

    <P>I would like to instance a number of the initiatives I have instigated to combat the drug addiction problem among the prison population. All committals to Mountjoy and St. Patrick's who misuse drugs are now offered a 14 day detoxification programme; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who misuse drugs are offered a detoxification programme of up to 21 days' duration tailored to their remand period; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who are <Col N="596" /> involved in a drug maintenance programme in the community prior to committal are allowed continue their programmes while in custody there; this maintenance programme option was extended to Mountjoy Prison in October, 2000, with all new committals and prisoners transferring from Cloverhill Remand Prison who were on approved treatment programmes continuing to receive this while in the prison; ongoing addiction counselling and education programmes are in place in all the closed prisons in this jurisdiction; community based agencies visit prisons to provide support services and information, including individual counselling as required; an information forum is provided by the education-welfare services to prisoners throughout the prisons estate informing them of the risks posed by communicable diseases; a detoxification and drug free unit is in operation in Mountjoy and an intensive drug-free therapy programme co-ordinated by the probation and welfare service and delivered by a multi-disciplinary team is in place; a second drug treatment programme began at the health care unit in Mountjoy in March 2000 &ndash; this offers a detoxification and intensive therapeutic counselling over 12 weeks to prisoners nearing release with a view to returning them drug-free onto a structured drug treatment programme in the community; a new drug-free wing in St. Patrick's Institution with a capacity for 76 inmates was officially opened by me on 22 November 2000. An initial group of 24 staff underwent developmental training to assist them in working with the new regime. This development has proven to be hugely successful with the wing currently operating to full capacity.</P>
    <P>An action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system was approved by me in 1999. It advocated a broad general approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This included the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug-free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services was central to this recommended approach which built on a medical policy which had been agreed between my Department and the then Eastern Health Board in this area. It sought to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Director General of the Prisons Service then established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, senior Prisons Service management, probation and welfare service, prisons psychology service and the prison education service. The group submitted its first report to me in July 2000 and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback.</P>
    <P>This report recommended the following three pronged strategy: The appointment of a drug treatment co-ordinator for the Dublin prisons; <Col N="597" /> recruitment of drug treatment specialists in the counselling, psychological and medical fields; and a training programme led by an assistant governor to enhance and further professionalise prison officers involved in interpersonal work with drug treatment prisoners. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report was approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prisons Service and health boards. A series of meetings has been held since November 2000 between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Department of Health and Children and the Prisons Service and health boards. As a result of these discussions, the recruitment process for the two key central positions identified in the steering group's report, that of the co-ordinator of drug treatment services, prisons, and the assistant governor in charge of training, is now at an advanced stage. I understand that these posts will be filled shortly.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the Department of Finance, the Prisons Service and the health boards are now in a position to commence the recruitment process for the other drug treatment posts recommended in the steering group's first report. Finally, building on all these plans and initiatives, I have given a policy direction to the Prisons Service to have an officially designated drug-free wing in place in every institution under its control by summer 2004.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the person in question applied for asylum in Ireland on 5 February 2001. I am further informed that, on investigation, it transpired that the person con<Col N="598" /> cerned had previously applied for asylum in the United Kingdom in January of 2001 but had left the UK before a substantive decision was made in his case. Accordingly, the Refugee Applications Commissioner decided on 3 July 2001 to recommend his return to the UK in line with the provisions of article 8 of the Dublin Convention. The person concerned appealed this decision and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal decided to affirm the decision of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in this case on 27 July 2001. I signed a deportation order in respect of the person concerned on 20 August 2001 approving transfer to the UK in accordance with the terms of the Dublin Convention. Subsequently, legal representatives of the person obtained an interim injunction to prevent the deportation to the UK after they initiated legal proceedings. These proceedings were struck out by the High Court on 19 September last and costs were awarded to the State. The person concerned was requested to present himself for his transfer to the UK on 1 October but failed to do so. Accordingly, he is now considered to have evaded the deportation order made in his case.</P>

Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications/appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>
      <P>A decision on the application in question will be made upon receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate.

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the purchase of the fee simple in the case of dwelling houses. To date, in excess of 74,633 people have purchased their <Col N="600" /> ground rents under the existing scheme. Part III of the Act sets out a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwelling houses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 15 times the ground rent. There is no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the 1978 (No. 2) Act.</P>
      <P>The 1978 (No. 2) Act also contains provision for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. Moreover, the Act makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found.</P>
      <P>In so far as future legislation is concerned, the Government's current legislation programme makes provision for a Bill to abolish ground rents. However, the content of such a proposal continues to be examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's Office and the Land Registry, since it raises certain constitutional, technical and practical difficulties. I hope that these difficulties can be overcome in a way that would improve on the readily available and reasonable system that already exists for the purchase of ground rents, and that the details of new legislation can be announced early in 2002. The question of holding a referendum to abolish ground rent on domestic dwellings does not, therefore, arise at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 900 to 906, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made into the origin of the Gaeltacht allowance and the position is as follows. In 1934 the Government approved the payment of a Gaeltacht allowance to gardaí serving in the Galway West division. It is understood that the purpose of the allowance was to support a drive being made at the time to promote the use of Irish in the newly formed Garda division of Galway West and to improve the status of the language amongst members there generally. In 1935, the Government authorised the payment of the allowance to gardaí serving in Irish speaking Garda districts in the Donegal division and Irish speaking Garda districts in the Kerry division.</P>
      <P>When the Gaeltacht allowance was introduced in 1934 it was decided that it would be paid only in areas where Irish is the general medium of speech and where all members of the force are proficient in Irish and are required to perform their duties in Irish. The areas where it is to be paid are determined on the basis of superintendents' districts as it is not regarded as practicable to arrange for members of the force in any</P>
      <P>particular station to conduct all their duties in Irish if Irish is not also in use at the district headquarters.</P>
      <P>The Gaeltacht allowance is calculated at 7.5% of basic pay and is payable to members of the force, up to and including the rank of chief superintendent, who are serving in the above districts and who perform their duties through the medium of Irish and whose knowledge of the language is certified as adequate for that purpose. The allowance is currently payable to 346 members of the force. The total amount paid in respect of the allowance for the tax year 2000-01 was £674,653.</P>

      <P>In my reply to the Deputy's question on 29 March 2001, I informed him that on 20 April 1998, the Government abolished the investment based naturalisation scheme which had commenced in 1989. In doing so, it also decided that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should initiate a review of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, to see how it might facilitate investment and, if in the course of that review information emerged which would warrant additional legislative measures, he should consider this.</P>
      <P>To assist in conducting the review, I established a review group, comprising representatives of my Department, which chaired the group, the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland together with two outside experts. I expect to be in a position to submit the report of the working group to Government in the coming weeks. Once the report has been considered by Government, I will arrange for its publication. The situation remains that the scheme stands abolished and I have no plans to reintroduce it.</P>

      <P>The person referred to was committed to Mountjoy Prison on 25 June 2001 serving a three month sentence for assault and road traffic offences. He was subsequently transferred to Loughan House Open Centre on the 26 June 2001 and, with enhanced remission, he was due for release on 9 August 2001. He was released on weekly renewable temporary release on 7 July 2001.</P>
      <P>It is a long standing policy not to comment in detail on the sentence management of any individual prisoner and I do not propose to make an exception in this case. I can, however, assure the Deputy that, before granting temporary release, careful consideration is given to a number of factors including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The overriding concern when decisions are made is the safety of the public.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that, as a direct consequence of the ongoing prison building programme, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion on temporary release of the total number of persons serving sentences. Every effort is made, where possible, to plan structured temporary releases for re-socialisation purposes and to allow the re-integration of offenders into the community.</P>

I am further advised by the Garda authorities that an extension of the current opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoors administrative duties. The Garda authorities are of the view that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 925 and 927 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875, fireworks may be imported only in accordance with importation licences issued by my Department. It is a long standing policy that such licences are issued only for organised displays conducted by professional and knowledgeable operators and not for the sale of fireworks. My Department is currently carrying out a review of the legislation relating to explosives and the question of the use of fireworks by individuals is one of the issues under consideration. My Department authorised the importation of 115 tonnes of fireworks since 1995 to date. While it is not possible to estimate the amount of fireworks which are illegally imported, a close watch is kept by the Garda authorities on the illegal trade and they do not hesitate to act where necessary. Through their vigilance, substantial amounts of fireworks are seized each year and subsequently destroyed. The commissioner has assured me that the gardaí will continue to allocate policing resources and be proactive in combating illegal importation and use of fireworks over the Halloween festive season.</P>

      <P>The court fee currently payable on an application for the renewal of a club licence is £120 under the District Court (Fees) Order, 2001. Fees orders are made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. I should point out that the District Court (Fees) Order, 2001, did not increase this fee, which has in fact been unchanged since 1997. In addition, there is an excise duty of £400, pursuant to the Finance Act, 1989, as amended by the Finance Act, 2000, which is paid to the Courts Service on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, to whom this excise duty is remitted. The Finance Acts are, of course, a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Notice of the application must be published in a daily newspaper circulating in the locality under the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, and I doubt that it would be prudent or acceptable to reduce or dispense with this publication requirement.</P>

      <P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 20 February 2001. The application is being considered under the provisions of section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986 and is in the early stages of the process. I informed the House both late last year and early this year that I intended to allocate significant additional resources to the citizenship area to reduce the then processing time of two and a half years. This has been done and the average processing time for applications for naturalisation now stands at 18 months &ndash; a reduction of 12 months approximately. It is likely, therefore, that the application referred to in the Deputy's question will be finalised in the second half of next year. As soon as full consideration has been given to this application, I will advise both the applicant and the Deputy of my decision.</P>

Since 1998 substantial progress has been made in developing and implementing the wide ranging recommendations contained in the 1997 Garda SMI report. One major project under Garda SMI is the review of Garda structures and operating systems. This consultant assisted review commenced in December 2000 and will be completed by the end of 2001. I understand that the final report will include recommendations on the appropriate structure and functions of HQ, regions, districts and divisions, the roles and responsibilities of ranks, the application of structures criteria to infrastructure, and service delivery and change management issues. The recommendations brought forward in the final report will be considered in the first instance by the Garda SMI steering group and ultimately by Government.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any reliable source, research or statistical framework upon which it could be claimed that the level of unreported crime has increased. In fact, I am not aware of any evidence of any description to support such a suggestion. It is, however, generally accepted across jurisdictions that a certain proportion of crime goes unreported. Although I consider that it is always in the best interest of an individual who is the victim of an offence to report the matter to the Garda Síochána, the reasons for non-reporting are complex and are not always readily amenable to resolution. For example, in 1999, the Central Statistics Office published the report Quarterly National Household Survey: Crime and Victimisation, which detailed responses to queries about crimes against individuals and households. The survey, the first of its kind, found that respondents failed <Col N="624" /> to report crimes for a variety of reasons, including the belief that the crime was not serious enough or that they had solved it themselves.</P>
      <P>It must also be noted that self-report studies, such as victimisation surveys, are not comparable with Garda statistics, as differing sources, definitions and classification methodologies are used. As a consequence, the various techniques for gathering data should be viewed as alternatives rather than direct comparables. I would, finally, reiterate that, owing to the lack of comparable self-report studies, there is no reason to believe that the level of unreported crime has increased in recent years.</P>

In addition, I have been informed by my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, that the provision of open spaces, recreational and sports facilities and amenity areas specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance.</P>

      <Col N="625" /> Meanwhile, my Department provides substantial funding under its sports capital programmes to assist organisations, clubs, community groups and local authorities in the provision of sport and recreational facilities to cater for a broad spectrum of sports and activities for all age groups and levels of participation, at national, regional and local levels throughout the country. Since taking office, I have allocated over £105 million to over 2020 projects in cities, towns and villages in every part of the country. Over the three years of the previous Government, only £18 million was allocated to such projects.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and specifically to assist the local authorities in the provision of good quality swimming pools for their local communities, I increased the annual budget of £3 million provided by the previous Government to a funding package of £45 million for the three year period 2000-02.</P>
    <P>The young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 for the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas and to date approximately £46 million has been allocated to support over 340 facility or service projects in these areas. Under this year's sports capital programme alone I allocated another £23.5 million to 370 sport and recreational facilities in designated disadvantaged areas in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>With other funding provided by my Department, the Irish Sports Council operates a range of programmes with national governing bodies and other organisations aimed at providing enhanced opportunities for all, including young people, to participate in sport and recreation. The council is piloting eight local sports partnerships as a further means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level and in increasing participation in sport. The council is also working with the GAA, FAI and IRFU in the implementation of special initiatives, both in identified areas of disadvantage and in the wider community, to promote and develop greater opportunities and increased involvement of children and young people in sport and recreation.</P>

      <P>No official estimates are as yet available in relation to the number or value of cancellations from the United States arising from the tragic events of 11 September 2001. However, although it is accepted that it is still too early to assess the overall impact on international travel patterns, it is clear that the terrorist attacks in the US are likely to impact on visitor numbers to Ireland, in particular from America, for the balance of this year and into 2002, leading to the first annual decline in visitor numbers for a decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest official CSO tourism and travel statistics published on Friday, 28 September indicate that earnings from overseas visitors to Ireland during the first half of 2001 showed an <Col N="627" /> increase of 3.8% to £1.3 billion on the same period last year. Overall visitor numbers for the first half of 2001 were down 5.2% to 2.7 million on the same period last year, with the slowdown being most acute in the case of Great Britain and North America. Total overseas visitor numbers for 2001 are now likely to show a further reduction on that figure following the terrorist attacks.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte's original estimate for 2001 was for an increase of 5% in overall visitor numbers, although that estimate had been revised significantly downwards in the light of the anticipated adverse impact of the foot and mouth disease emergency earlier this year. Ironically, Irish tourism was beginning to show signs of recovery from this setback, mainly due to the early lifting of the major foot and mouth restrictions in line with expert technical advice and subsequently due to the beneficial impact of a targeted £10 million international and domestic tourism marketing reassurance campaign by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Since the tragic events of 11 September I and officials of my Department have met with senior management of both Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all island tourism marketing company, and with a high level delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, to take stock of the situation and to put in place arrangements to ensure that marketing strategies will be developed to deal with the fall out from the recent atrocity for the remainder of this years' season and for 2002. Critical factors will include not only the nature and duration of the response to the terrorist attacks, but also the speed with which public confidence in air travel can be restored.</P>
    <P>Given the changed environment, it is vitally important that there is a root and branch reassessment of our tourism marketing strategies, including how and where we focus our business, so that the substantial Exchequer funding already allocated for this area under the national development plan has maximum impact.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday, Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited confirmed that they were urgently re-examining, in consultation with the tourism industry and through the tourism marketing partnership structure, their respective marketing programmes and plans for the remainder of 2001 and for 2002. Bord Fáilte announced late last week a £750,000 programme of additional immediate measures for the British and Irish markets. Meanwhile, the new chief executive of Tourism Ireland Limited is already spear-heading the review of marketing plans for 2002 with the intention of making a major announcement early next month in conjunction with the launch of a new advertising campaign for the island of Ireland. These moves have been welcomed by ITIC.</P>
    <P>The Government is also very conscious of the important link between competitive air access and future tourism flows and has been working <Col N="628" /> closely with the Irish aviation sector to help resolve recent difficulties.</P>
    <P>Given the changed circumstances, it is vitally important to quickly bed down the process of institutional change now under way in the tourism State agencies, which have remained unchanged in structure since the early 1960s, and to complete an orderly handover of responsibility to Tourism Ireland Limited well in time for the 2002 marketing season. I also welcome the initial positive expression of support from the council of CERT and the board of Bord Fáilte to the proposed creation of a new integrated tourism development agency. My intention is that we have strong structures in place to implement our medium-term plans for international marketing, product and human resource development, as contained in the national development plan, in order to help the tourism industry to meet the major challenges that lie ahead.</P>

      <P>The council is currently piloting the concept amongst the eight selected local partnerships which were announced on 2 May last. These are located in Clare, Donegal, Fingal, Kildare, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North and were selected, after open competition, to pilot local sports partnerships. Four other areas, Cork, Limerick, Meath and Waterford, are currently involved in an extensive development process with a view to joining the pilot programme in 2002. It is intended to have completed an evaluation of the pilot by mid 2003 and the proven effectiveness of the concept will determine the extending of the scheme to other areas from end 2003.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the interdepartmental committee considering the disposal of the Eastern Regional Health Authority site in Grangegorman, Dublin 7, are to examine how the Grangegorman site can best be developed to achieve Government policy priorities in meeting education and social service needs and in tackling construction industry capacity constraints. This will be done in a way which takes into account the overall development of Dublin and leverages the strategic location and commercial potential of the site to attract private involvement on a PPP basis, having particular regard to the following: access by Dublin Institute of Technology at the <Col N="631" /> earliest possible date to facilities needed for apprenticeship training, with site occupation as from the academic year 2001-02; provision, on a staged basis over the longer-term, of modern campus facilities needed by Dublin Institute of Technology in the context of Government policy for third level education as a whole; provision in the short-term, as part of the package, of non-acute units needed by the ERHA on part of the campus, but also on other sites in the region, taking account of the investment in kind by the authority; arrangements to afford the local community access to playing field facilities on the campus; integration of the proposed campus development with Luas and other relevant public transport provision; an approach to financing that includes leverage of the site's strategic location and commercial potential to lessen the burden on the Exchequer and avoids circular transfer of funds between Votes.</P>
      <P>Membership of the working group includes representatives of the ERHA, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Corporation, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, Finance and the Taoiseach. The group first met on 16 May 2001 and has met on four occasions since. I have been informed that the Group should be able to complete its work and submit a report to Government in the near future. The working group report will be made available publicly. The Grangegorman site is of strategic importance in the context of Dublin as a whole. My Department is working with the other Departments and agencies represented on the working group to ensure that its strategic location and potential are unlocked to best meet the Government's objectives in the provision of high quality health and education services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 988, 989 and 992 together.</P>
      <P>My objective with regard to the selection of members to the committee on deaf education is to ensure that the committee is comprised of people with the necessary expertise and experience to address the range of issues requiring consideration. It is not intended that members of the committee should simply act as representatives of their particular school or organisation or that the committee should include a representative of every individual school or organisation with an involvement or interest in the education of the hearing impaired. The Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to limit the composition of the committee to manageable proportions so that it can operate in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of representations received, I propose to increase from one to two the number of nominees from the special schools sector. The intention is that one of these will have expertise in the area of educational provision at primary level and the other will have expertise in relation to provision at second level. I have also decided to invite the Model School for the Deaf to put forward a nominee to the committee. Nominations have now been received from the majority of the bodies invited to participate. I expect that outstanding nominations will be submitted to my Department in the coming days. The Catholic Institute for the Deaf and the National Association for Deaf People play an important role in representing the interests of the hearing impaired. Both these bodies will make an important contribution to the work of the committee.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to include a representative of Roslyn Park or the adult literacy project on the committee at this stage. I am anxious that the initial focus of the committee's work should be on the area of provision at pre-school, primary and second level. The composition of the committee as now proposed will be fully capable of addressing these areas. However, once the committee has reported on the areas in question, it will extend its focus to address issues relating to provision for persons of post second level age. At that stage the composition of the committee will be reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to ensure that the relevant expertise is available to the committee. The committee will be free to invite oral or written submissions from any parties which it considers relevant in the course of its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the Advisory Committee on the Education of the Hearing Impaired is: chairperson nominated by the Minister for Education and Science; two nominees of the Minister for Education and Science; one nominee of the Minister for Health and Children; two nominees of the special schools for the deaf; one nominee of the National Association for the Deaf; one nominee of the Irish Deaf Society; one nominee of the Catholic Institute for the Deaf; one nominee of the visiting teacher service; one nominee <Col N="633" /> from the Model School for the Deaf Project; one nominee of the INTO; one nominee of the ASTI-TUI; one nominee of schools management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, proposed that adult asylum seekers would have free access to literacy, English language and mother culture supports. vocational education committees have been advised that adult literacy funds may be used for this purpose to the extent that resources allow. To progress matters further, an action research project with a full-time co-ordinator has been put in place in the Dublin area to assess the language and literacy needs of asylum seekers in consultation with key interests, to initiate pilot actions and make recommendations on a framework and costings for addressing future needs in this area.</P>
      <P>To date the project has undertaken research on the numbers, rights and entitlements of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland. This report, Immigration and Residency in Ireland, was published by City of Dublin VEC in March 2000; engaged in extensive consultations with refugee-asylum groups, FÁS, health board and welfare interests and educational practitioners on how best to meet needs; provided pilot training programmes in a number of locations for asylum seekers, including specific groups for women and summer programmes for unaccompanied minors; and provided staff development programmes for providers on the language, literacy and intercultural aspects of provision; established a working group to develop support materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> The primary research for this project is now complete and the results and recommendations are currently being prepared by the VEC. The final phase of this project will consist of focus groups with asylum seekers and refugees to discuss the nature of the recommendations and whether they truly address their needs. A report of outcomes from the pilot projects together with recommendations for future programme development is expected in early 2002.</P>
    <P>This project is working in tandem with that of a working group established by the Irish Vocational Education Association in this area, whose report was recently published. In addition, my Department has provided funds for the Refugee Language Support Unit in Trinity College for staff development and materials production in this area in consultation with the project and the National Adult Literacy Agency.</P>

      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school-community liaison service. There are no immediate plans to expand the home-school-community liaison scheme. However, in <Col N="636" /> the event of any future expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme, the needs of the school in question will be fully considered.</P>
      <P>My Department has received an application for grant-aid towards the cost of a building project at the school in question. In view of the large volume of projects currently being dealt with, it is not possible to say when this matter can be progressed further.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that last January I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three-year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and has received supplementary grant aid of £6,454 in respect of the 2000-2001 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school will be allocated a similar sum in the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
      <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of this school and other such schools is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future</P>

The two new awarding councils have three principal functions: the establishment of policies and criteria for the making of awards and the validation of programmes; the determination of standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners, before an award may be made by a council or recognised by a council and the making and recognition of awards where persons have achieved the required standards.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1000 and 1058 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil, with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase substantially this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may also be aware that I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to remove certain anomalies which exist in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services for schools and also put in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment <Col N="639" /> in the Programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who has a secured place in an approved institution and has reached that age on the first day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, 2001, an independent mature candidate is defined as a candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his-her parents from 1 October 2000.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</P>
      <P>As the student to whom the Deputy refers was not 23 on 1 January 2001, she cannot be assessed as an independent mature student. There are no plans at present to change the eligibility criteria in this regard but the issue is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>The family in question resided 0.7 miles from the route of service to the school. As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, to or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. In this case the family applied to have the service extended and paid for by themselves. The service has now been extended.</P>

      <P>The centre referred to by the Deputy is a resource and referral centre known as the Aislinn Centre for persons who have suffered insti<Col N="645" /> tutional abuse. The centre was opened in October 1999 and is managed by a number of persons who were themselves victims of abuse. My Department is, together with the Department of Health and Children, involved in the support of the Aislinn Centre. This support is provided through the National Office for Victims of Abuse which pays all the running costs of the centre. I am informed that the management of the centre is satisfactory. It has provided both counselling and educational services to its members, and has in many cases assisted individuals to make enormous progress in re-building their lives. As tangible evidence of this progress, the centre only last week published a collection of short stories and poetry written and prepared by members of the centre itself. The launch of that book, which was hosted by the Taoiseach, is real evidence of the difference that the centre is making to its members, and I hope it will continue to do so into the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1022, 1025, 1032, 1076, 1091 and 1092 together.</P>
      <P>Currently, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-9 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. There are no plans at present to replace this scheme by a scheme of direct payment by my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools at second level now also receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. While provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund, schools themselves are given discretion as to how precisely the funding is applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased <Col N="647" /> basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the re-distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE.</P>
    <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>The question of upgrading the school bus fleet is primarily a matter for Bus Éireann and the private contractors who provide a high proportion of the school bus fleet. Bus Éireann's policy of continuous fleet replacement facilitates the improvement of the quality of vehicles used in the operation of the school transport scheme, and provides a better standard of service for pupils availing of school transport. As part of their ongoing policy of improving the age and condition of the school bus fleet, arrangements are in train to purchase more modern vehicles for school transport purposes with an emphasis on replacing the oldest buses in the fleet. In addition, <Col N="648" /> more modern vehicles are being introduced into the school bus fleet on a phased basis as new buses are being introduced on road passenger services. These initiatives will result in a further general improvement in the age and condition of this fleet.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the award of a grant is the candidate's gross income from all sources and that of his-her parents or guardians, where applicable, less certain social welfare and health board payments which are excluded from the calculation of income. Inquiries have been made with County Cork VEC regarding the student in question and my Department understands that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the limits set down in the relevant higher education grants scheme and that, accordingly, the student is ineligible for grant assistance.</P>
      <P>Apart from the funding provided by my Department through the free fees initiative and the maintenance grants schemes, financial support is also available to students attending approved third level colleges through my Department's student assistance/access fund and the special fund for students with disabilities. The objective of the student assistance/access fund is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate matter, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The purpose of the special fund is to provide students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. Information on these funds is available from the access officer and the disability officer, respectively, in the institution attended by the student.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to remove certain anomalies which exist in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools and also put in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>I would add, however, that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school-based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school-based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working in CE in schools up to and including 2004, depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. There is no question that all FÁS participants on CE schemes in primary schools are due to be withdrawn from schools on 19 October 2001. While this may be the case in individual schools, I am confident that schools will welcome the new guidelines that will be issued shortly by my Department, and which will outline the new funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. In order to apply for a special needs assistant post, schools should contact their school inspector. Complete details of any pupils who require support from a special needs assistant should be given to the inspector, together with supporting reports from relevant care professionals. Further details on the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>Teachers who have retired compulsorily on age grounds are currently allowed to take up employment as substitute teachers in primary schools on a casual basis, without interruption of their pension payments. It is also possible for such teachers to be employed in a temporary capacity for short periods, but they must forfeit their superannuation benefits for the duration of their temporary contract.</P>
      <P>I am currently investigating the possibility of putting arrangements in place to facilitate retired teachers who wish to take up teaching positions in a temporary capacity. It is expected that this investigation will be completed in the near future. My Department will then consider the issue in consultation with the education partners.</P>

    <P>The person in question gave service as a teacher in New Zealand and Australia between 1969 and 1989. She took up a permanent appointment here in January 2001 and was granted the maximum incremental credit of seven years in respect of her teaching service outside the EU. The teaching service in New Zealand and Australia is not reckonable here for pension purposes.

      <P>A circular letter outlining the policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils in primary schools issued to the boards of management of all schools in March 2001. The policy as outlined in the circular letter was already outlined in rule 64 of the rules for national schools and in a previous Department circular 10/67. The purpose of the C &ndash; primary circular 11/01 &ndash; was to reaffirm the policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils.</P>
      <P>In recent years, my Department has allocated considerable support for pupils with learning difficulties in schools. Learning support teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants and a wide range of resources under the various schemes for schools in areas designated as disadvantaged are among the forms of provision allocated to schools for these pupils. The level of provision now available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school in keeping with their peers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there may be individual cases where a principal teacher, following consultation with the learning support teacher and class teacher and parents of the pupil, concludes that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for a second year. In such cases, my Department would favour the retention, provided there is an educational basis for the decision and if there is a clear programme for the pupil to follow. Children should only repeat a year for educational reasons and an additional level should not be created through the retention of all or a substantial number of pupils for a second year at a grade level.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and three mainstream class teachers, based on the enrolment of 109 as at 30 September 2000. This is the authorised staffing for the school. The school also has the services of a shared learning support teacher. The enrolment of the school as at 30 September 2001 determines the staffing for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed arrangement is in the case of developing schools. The increase in enrolment between 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2001 does not satisfy the criteria for the allocation of an additional post for the 2001-02 school year. Unfortunately, I am not, therefore, in a position to sanction the appointment of a fourth mainstream class teacher for this school for the 2001-02 school year.</P>

      <P>Last January I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March/April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received at that time from the school referred to by the Deputy. In the absence of a completed survey form from the school, the</P>
      <P>ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils in the school with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools. In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of such schools seeking inclusion in the new programme is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

These cases relate to industrial and reformatory schools. The most recent figures available to my Department indicate that there were 82 cases relating to abuse in national or second level day schools. However, I understand that this number is likely to rise significantly when updated information from the Chief State Solicitor's office, which will also include further information concerning day schools, is made available. My Department expects to receive this information shortly, and I will arrange for that revised information to be forwarded to the Deputy when that exercise is completed.</P>

      <P>The Government has recently published the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, to establish a body to make financial awards to those persons who as children were abused in institutions in which they were resident and for which the State had significant regulatory or supervisory responsibility. The special case referred to by the Deputy relates to the alleged infliction of injuries on persons who were in attendance at a day school. The Residential Institutions Redress Bill will not cover those persons who may have been abused while attending day schools.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to provide for this particular type of compensation scheme is based the legal responsibilities of the public bodies concerned and the fact that the children concerned were separated from their parents and therefore did not enjoy the care and protection which children in the care of their parents enjoy. They relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them and it is now all too clear that, notwithstanding that duty, children were abused. These considerations do not apply to children who were resident with their families while at school and so the decision to set up the redress board does not extend to them.</P>
      <P>The Government has already provided an alternative means of redress for any person who suffered sexual abuse in the past. The amendments to the Statute of Limitations Act recognises that persons who suffered sexual abuse in the past may not have been in a position, due to the abuse suffered, to take legal action against the abuser. Normally a person would only have three years from the date on which he or she attained his or her majority to bring such an action. The Act now provides that the normal period of three years within which a person can bring an action will not apply where a person is suffering from such a disability. The Act also recognises that some persons who suffered sexual abuse may have been previously advised that their claims were statute barred. To assist such persons in bringing a claim, the Act provided for a special one year period, from June 2000 to June of this year, to allow such persons to commence actions against their alleged abusers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Capitation grants constitute the main form of Government funding for primary schools with a standard capitation grant of £75.50 applying in the last school year. Capitation funding is intended to contribute to the cost of such items as heating, lighting, cleaning, general upkeep and teaching aids required in schools. This payment is made in respect of all children enrolled in ordinary classes in a school and would include any special needs children who are enrolled on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These special rates can range from £278.50 to £451.50 per pupil depending on the particular level of need involved. Children attending special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools would generally have a level of special need which renders them unable to attend ordinary national schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference in the level of capitation funding attracted by pupils attending special schools or special classes and those attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis arises from the <Col N="667" /> reduced number of pupils involved in each special classroom situation. The number of children per classroom in special schools and special classes will be significantly lower than the number in an ordinary national school classroom. However, the general operating costs arising in both situations, in terms of light, heating etc., will not be reduced because of the lesser number of pupils in attendance.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, the level of funding attracted by each child attending a special class needs to be correspondingly greater than the norm in order to meet the standard operating costs which will continue to be incurred. For example, a special class for children with a mild general learning disability will cater for a maximum of 11 children. Such a classroom would give rise to the same ongoing operating costs as an ordinary classroom in a national school which would cater for a significantly higher number of pupils. It is necessary therefore that the special class children attract a correspondingly higher rate of capitation funding in order to meet the costs involved. In the case of children with special needs, attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis, such additional capitation costs would not apply.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between arrangements relating to the funding of schools' ongoing operating costs and funding requirements which might arise where, for example, a child with a disability requires a special piece of equipment. Special separate funding arrangements are in place to deal with special equipment needs and any school can make application to my Department for funding towards the purchase of such equipment.</P>
    <P>My Department will consider applications from mainstream national schools for the provision of specialised equipment for pupils with special needs who have been fully integrated into the mainstream system. Should the school referred to by the Deputy wish to apply for additional funding for special equipment such application should be made through its local school inspector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Kilcloon national school is funded under the PESP scheme and received a payment of £7,200 towards secretarial and caretaking services earlier this year.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase substantially this year.</P>
      <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment, CE, schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services for schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the <Col N="670" /> new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>I have set aside funding to meet the cost of developing reach-out provision in Wexford and have approved the appointment of a head of centre to draw up a project plan and drive the project forward. This post was advertised recently and an appointment will be made on completion of the recruitment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the project in Kilkenny, as the Deputy will be aware, NUI Maynooth established the Kilkenny outreach campus in St. Kieran's college, Kilkenny in 1997. I have recently agreed to fund this pilot project on a five year basis. The Higher Education Authority is in discussion with the university regarding the level of funding required and I expect to receive the outcome of these discussions in the near future. Proposals for <Col N="671" /> similar initiatives in other areas will be reviewed in light of the experience gained from the development of the centres in Wexford and Kilkenny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, teachers are class teachers rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy my Department that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
      <P>However, teachers trained in another member state of the European Union, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period of provisional recognition these teachers are remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers. The period of provisional recognition was extended from three to five years in order to allow such teachers adequate time to prepare for and pass the Irish language examination and also in response to the ongoing teacher supply issue at primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, teachers trained in countries outside of the European Union, including the United States of America, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, are now also being granted a five year period of <Col N="675" /> provisional recognition to allow them to teach in mainstream classes in primary schools. This change was effected from 1 September 2000 in view of the current shortage of qualified primary teachers, and will apply until September 2002 at which stage it will be reviewed. In common with EU trained teachers, non-EU teachers will be required to work towards achieving the Irish language qualification during their period of provisional recognition. Non-EU trained teachers will be remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers during their period of provisional recognition.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have a number of changes to the Irish qualification examination aimed at assisting teachers trained outside the State to obtain the Irish language qualification. The most important of these are outlined as follows: the extension of the period of provisional recognition from three to five years &ndash; as the exam is held twice a year, candidates will have up to ten opportunities to sit the examination during their period of provisional recognition; the examination now comprises four individual modules &ndash; teachers can prepare for and sit different modules at different times and teachers who pass an individual module will be exempt from that module for a period of five years; and courses are being provided, through the education centre network, to facilitate teachers preparing for the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
      <P>St. Michael's primary school currently has the service of a full-time caretaker under this scheme and also employed a full-time secretary from 1979 until she resigned in 1988. At that time an embargo on posts existed and there was no provision for the filling of posts which had occurred from 1982 onwards. The question of the reinstatement of the post to St. Michael's was considered by officials in my Department in 1990 but it was concluded that there was no basis for reinstatement. My Department has outlined this position in correspondence with the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme. The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. The scheme, by its nat<Col N="677" /> ure, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. St. Michael's primary school is in receipt of funding under the PESP scheme towards secretarial services and has received a total grant of £5,660 this year.</P>
    <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment, CE, schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the programme for government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 2000, I established the action group on access to third level education to advise me on the most effective ways to increase participation by disadvantaged groups at third level. The group's report makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>The special rates are payable only where a student is already in receipt of a maintenance grant under one of the following means tested schemes &ndash; the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. The special rates of maintenance grant are not applicable in cases where a student holds a VTOS payment only.</P>
      <P>Eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant are based on recommendations made by the action group. In order to target those most in need, eligibility is confined to students where family income comes from long-term social welfare payments or from specific schemes such as the community employment scheme. Unemployment benefit and the short-term rate of unemployment assistance are not, however, approved payments for the purpose of determining eligibility for the special rates of grant.</P>
      <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of a full-time secretary and caretaker under a 1978-79 scheme for the employment of secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
      <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes &ndash; CE &ndash; come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school-based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in <Col N="681" /> a school-based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. The school in question should clarify its position in this regard with FÁS.</P>
    <P>Finally, if it is the case that this school used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities, it should be noted that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from the special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that when an explanatory note is used on a certificate it does not make any reference to a candidate's disability or special need. It does no more than provide factual information on how the standard national assessment in the case of the candidate concerned was carried out. My Department considers that, by ensuring that the explanatory note is confined to a factual narrow statement on the assessment issues rather than a reference to the nature of the arrangement or the special need of the candidate, we have a better model than employed elsewhere. Our model does not categorise or label the candidate in any way because the explanatory note is confined to the assessment issue alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the certificate examinations. The examination system allows a student, depending on his-her special need, have his-her result in a subject based upon all except some element of the examination in that subject. I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the grade awarded is a full and accurate reflection of the candidate's performance in the examination and <Col N="682" /> the examination certificates issued by my Department state that unequivocally.</P>
    <P>This inclusiveness measure enables a candidate to obtain maximum marks for the subject even though his-her special need precludes him-her from demonstrating attainment in core elements of the standard assessment. It discriminates in favour of the special needs candidate by allowing him-her a waiver not available to candidates generally.</P>
    <P>The use of the explanatory note is one of the principles identified by the expert advisory group on certificate examinations that reported on this issue in January 2000. The publication of the report followed an extensive national consultative process that included submissions from the National Dyslexia Association of Ireland, formerly known as the ACLD. Following publication of that report and the implementation of the principles identified by the expert advisory group Department officials met with representatives of the then ACLD and had discussions with them in relation to the principles. The issue of notation was raised and the officials explained how in line with international practice the use of notation underpinned the capacity to allow students with specific learning difficulties the opportunity to obtain full marks notwithstanding the fact that they are unable to demonstrate attainment in crucial elements of the standard assessment in language subjects.</P>

      <P>Last January I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three-year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the rural dimension and has received supplementary grant aid of £750 in respect of the 2000-01 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school will be allocated a similar sum in the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question were received by the Educational Research Centre. My Department has received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of this school and other such schools is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of a full-time caretaker under this scheme. While this post is fully funded by my Department, the caretaker involved is an employee of the individual school authority. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The school referred to by the Deputy is funded under the PESP scheme in respect of secretarial services and received a <Col N="687" /> payment of £3,960 earlier this year for secretarial support.</P>
    <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase substantially this year.</P>
    <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes &ndash; CE &ndash; come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school-based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school-based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. The school in question should clarify its position in this regard with FÁS.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is noted from the correspondence supplied by the Deputy that the school in question has four teacher assistants under the CE scheme. If it is the case that this school used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities, it should be noted that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a <Col N="688" /> special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from the special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

These include the 8-15s early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative. The position of the school referred will be considered in any future expansion of these schemes.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, operates a scheme for the provision of after school support services. Furthermore, he has established an interdepartmental working group, on which my Department is represented, to review the existing school meals scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs operates the existing school meals scheme in conjunction with various local authorities. The work of this group is continuing at present and I understand that it is hoped to finalise its report in the near future.</P>

      <P>The possible need for a school on a Greenfield site normally comes to the attention of my Department when a local authority is preparing a draft action plan for a developing area. Officials from my Department meet local authorities as necessary to identify and anticipate such school accommodation needs. My Department's general aim is to ensure that the school is provided only when the need has clearly emerged.

This is now being assessed within the building unit of my Department and they will be in touch with the VEC in due course. In relation to the provision of a sports hall at the college, approval in principle has also been given for this project. My Department is currently preparing PE hall templates. These will standardise the construction of PE halls at second level schools and will reduce the architectural planning processes considerably. The templates are being piloted in four schools initially and are expected to be available in the first half of next year for generic use.</P>

      <P>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board expels a student from the school. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, a longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception where it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42 day limit.</P>
      <P>Section 29 (4) provides that appeals must be concluded within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the appeal by the Secretary General, with the possibility of extending this period by 14 days. The date of receipt for this purpose shall be deemed to be the date on which the completed appeals application form containing all the required information has been received by my Department.</P>
      <P>There are three layers to the procedures: Having regard to the desirability of resolving grievances within the school where possible, the parties to an appeal, i.e. the appellant and the board of management, will be asked to consider the matter in the first instance at local level to see if an accommodation can be reached. Notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement at local level, it may be considered possible to facilitate agreement between the appellant and school. If so, a facilitator will be appointed to attempt to broker an agreement between the parties. If facilitation fails the appeals will be forwarded to an appeals committee comprised of three persons, i.e. a departmental inspector and two other people who have the requisite expertise, experience and independence to serve on the committee.</P>
      <P>The appeals committee will notify its determination to the Secretary General of my Department. The Secretary General will notify the parties of the determination of the appeal, and, if applicable, issue such directions as he or she considers necessary to the school. The board of management will be bound by such direction.</P>
      <P>My Department gives assistance in securing alternative placement in individual cases. It endeavours through a process of consultation with schools, involving my Department's inspectorate, to identify and arrange for the placement of the child in a suitable school. In very difficult situations the national educational psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy share the services of a full-time secretary under the 1978-79 scheme. However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my officials will be writing to both schools shortly outlining proposals to allocate the post in its entirety to one of the schools concerned. The other school will then become eligible for additional funding under a more extensive grant scheme that was introduced in the PESP agreement in 1992.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Both schools have already been included in this scheme for caretaking support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approxi<Col N="700" /> mately £12.2 million and will further increase substantially this year.</P>
    <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes &ndash; CE &ndash; come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has the services of a shared learning support teacher post which is shared with three other schools in the area. All available learning support teacher posts have been allocated as part of the process of extending the learning support service to every primary school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be taken fully into account in the event of additional learning support teacher posts becoming available for distribution.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides annual grants towards the cost of staff<Col N="702" /> ing and equipment in respect of nine recognised VEC outdoor education centres. Negotiations between my officials and trade union representatives of the staff employed in the centres regarding improved terms and conditions of employment are taking place at present. In conjunction with these negotiations, issues relating to the future funding of outdoor education centres are being considered. Any new arrangements reached will be relevant in determining my Department's future budgetary planning and funding strategy for VEC outdoor education centres. It is in this context that the matter of recognising Tanagh outdoor education centre is being addressed.</P>

      <P>The reckonable income limit for the purpose of the special rates of maintenance grant for the 2001-02 academic year is £7,400. The special rates of maintenance grant are aimed at students in disadvantaged circumstances. In order to target those most in need, eligibility is confined to students where family income comes from long-term social welfare payments or from specific schemes such as the community employment scheme.</P>
      <P>Students from low income farming backgrounds where the parent(s)/guardian or spouse-partner is in receipt of a farm assist payment, from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs, are eligible to be assessed for the special rate of maintenance grant. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>

Accordingly, a one-year access foundation course is not an approved course for the purpose of considering eligibility under the scheme. The report of the action group on access to third level education, which I launched last July, has, however, recommended that the scope of the schemes of maintenance grants and of the free fees initiative should be extended to validated access courses.

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was designed for long-term unemployed people.

This full-time scheme is confined to adults over 21 who are in receipt of unemployment assistance/benefit, a one-parent family payment, disability allowance/benefit or signing for credits. A person must be in receipt of one of the above allowances for at least six months in order to be eligible to join VTOS. Dependent spouses of these categories are also eligible for the programme. A training allowance is paid <i>in lieu </i>of welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>As the scheme was specifically designed to address the needs of those who are unemployed, there are no plans to extend it to those over 65. However, there are no age barriers governing free participation on full-time PLC courses for those who wish to do so.</P>

      <Quest>if schools are entitled to decide, on the basis of in-school tests, that only pupils above a certain ranking will be allowed take honours level in the junior certificate; his policy on this issue; and the channels of complaint under the Education Act, 1998 which can be followed by a parent aggrieved by this procedure.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22444/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, sets out a clear statutory framework within which the Irish education sector can operate and continue to develop. The rights and roles of all the partners in education are clearly laid down in the Act. The Act also places considerable emphasis upon the principle of partnership in the management and operation of our education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 assign to each principal teacher responsibility for the instruction provided to students in the school. The functions of principals range from overseeing the day-to-day management of schools to providing leadership to staff and students. In keeping with the principle <Col N="705" /> of partnership that underpins the Act, principals are asked to encourage the involvement of parents in the education of their children.</P>
    <P>The Act encourages principals to have due regard to the wishes of parents. However, another objective of the Act is to enhance the operation and management of schools and, in order to ensure that schools are run in as effective manner as possible, every principal must balance the wishes of individual parents with the needs of the school community when carrying out his or her functions.</P>
    <P>The rules and programme for secondary schools does not specifically state that school authorities should use the results of in-school tests to determine the level of the examination which junior certificate students may sit for in the various subjects. However, it would be expected that schools would use the results of such tests, allied to the views of the relevant teachers, and taking due account of the wishes of parents in allocating teaching resources to best suit the needs and abilities of each student.</P>
    <P>Junior certificate candidates, who are eligible to sit the examination, themselves make the choice of level at which a particular subject will be taken, normally on the advice of and on consultation with their subject teachers. They indicate this choice on a form which is completed in the school, usually by 31 March of the year of the examination, and sent to the examinations branch of my Department in Athlone. This practice means that the choice of level is not made by the candidate on the day of the examination, so that the danger of unwise decisions is avoided. However, in the event of a genuine mistake, the student may on the day of the examination, seek to change level and the examination superintendent, with the consent of the school authorities, will facilitate this change of mind.</P>
    <P>The Education Act, 1998, does not include a specific channel of complaint which may be followed by parents aggrieved by such decisions taken by a school. In such cases parents are advised that they should appeal the decision to the board of management of the school in question.</P>

In response to the findings of the survey, last year grants amounting to £10,500 each were paid to all schools offering the physical sciences at senior cycle for science equipment. In addition to the above, the post primary building unit of my Department processes applications from school managerial authorities for capital grant assistance towards new or refurbished science laboratory facilities.
