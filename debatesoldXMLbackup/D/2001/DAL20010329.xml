      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices. On the first topic I received notices from Deputies Gormley and Naughten.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the refusal of the United States President, George W. Bush, to ratify the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas emissions and the implications that decision has for global warming and for international relations, particularly for relations between the EU and the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the people in this House, including Fianna Fáil backbenchers, some of whom have had the courage to speak out publicly, are appalled that the Government is pursuing the Sinnott family through the Supreme Court in relation to an award that was granted to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the <Col N="1071" /> House has nothing to do with this. The proposal concerns the Stockholm summit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked, and it is a device with which the Chair is familiar, to accept the Order of Business, including these proposals. The only opportunity we have to voice our opposition is through this method.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Order of Business could have provided for a debate on either motion 128 or 129 and all the courageous backbenchers in Fianna Fáil would have the courage then to come into the House and voice their opposition to the oppression of the Sinnott family and many others in a similar position. Legislation could be brought in to deal with the issues that are being appealed to the Supreme Court. We are opposed to what the Government is doing in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: It is the duty of the Chair to point out the exact proposal. The proposal is the arrangements for the statements on the European summit in Stockholm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the duty of the Chair, and it is the duty of Opposition parties to exploit every parliamentary device within the system to bring to light cases of oppression that do not have the support of the majority of people in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Quinn I do not have the facilitiy of the Leader's question but I reiterate what he has said about the Sinnott case. On the issue of the European Council debate, given that my colleague, Deputy Gormley, raised the critical issue for both European and Irish interests of the President of America not ratifying the Kyoto protocol, it is ironic that the Green Party does not&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;have the opportunity of following through on this issue in the Dáil because of the way the debate is structured. I make that point and ask that it be addressed given the seriousness of the issue which Deputy Gormley raised. The SIPTU dispute does not seem to have figured in the Government's thinking either and it will cause immense disruption. Is the Government concerned about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seldom I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Quinn, but it seems to me he has given an example of a classic oxymoron this morning where the adjective contradicts the noun because the idea of a courageous Fianna Fáil backbencher is surely an absolute contradiction. We all know the Deputy is trying to back the horse both ways. We are opposing the Order of Business for the reasons I have already stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will share the feelings of impending crisis expressed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning. What additional plans has the Government in place in the event of another case of foot and mouth disease being confirmed in County Louth or any other part of the country? Does the Taoiseach realise there is widespread criticism among farmers in the Cooley Peninsula that they have to rely on the media for information on the future of their livelihoods and, in particular, the future of their herds?</P>
      <P>Does he further accept there is discontent among the wider non-farming community in tourism, haulage and other sectors whose businesses are being affected? Are plans prepared which can be put in place if the news is as bad as suggested by the Minister this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Noonan, will the Taoiseach indicate when the House will be given full details of the new tagging system for sheep? Will that system provide for full and accountable traceability to ensure, in effect, a continuous line from field to fork so consumers can be satisfied of the quality and the origins of the produce they eat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for his support. I will deal with the same points the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development mentioned this morning in order to bring the House up to date. We will not have the results of checks on samples from the holding at Piedmont on the Cooley peninsula before tomorrow morning; they were sent to Pirbright Laboratories yesterday. This particular farm is adjacent to the farm of the Rice family. The families are related and the lands are contiguous. The clinical signs are strong but they are different from last week's case. Preliminary results should be available tomorrow morning. A case in this location will not, of course, require an extension of the control zone beyond Louth, so trade would not be affected. All the precautionary measures have been taken and the teams, including staff at the Ballymascanlan centre, are already in place. I would be surprised to hear of any more complaints. The Minister himself has been with the farmers over the last few days and there is a daily briefing at 6 o'clock at Ballymascanlan. The veterinary teams are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, at our parliamentary party meeting, I heard praise and thanks from my colleagues for the veterinary teams who have been working on the Cooley peninsula. They met with farmers there last Saturday and Sunday until 2 a.m. The veterinary teams continue to work in the area, as are the Garda sections who are dealing with this <Col N="1075" /> issue. Of course, I understand the tension and anxiety being felt by people and, at times, decisions will have to be taken quickly. In this case, however, following advice from senior veterinary officials at last Saturday's meeting, the Minister has made it clear that further slaughtering of herds on the Cooley peninsula is under consideration, depending on what happens.</P>
    <P>The results of preliminary tests on tissue from Camolin, Laois and Waterford have been negative. Preliminary results from Slaney Meats in Clohamon near Bunclody are expected tomorrow morning. To answer Deputy Noonan, if even one of those locations tested positive it would change the position, but preliminary results would seem to indicate that will not be the case. Hopefully that will prove to be so, although one can never be certain. Detailed arrangements, involving the Army, Garda Síochána, veterinary teams and officials are in place to ring-fence these areas if the case arises. That could happen anywhere in the country, not alone in those areas, but the contingency arrangements are in place. In addition, officials of farming organisations and other people have been briefed on the situation.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for tagging have been finalised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and he is perhaps best placed to give a briefing on that matter to Opposition spokespersons, as necessary. I am sure he will be glad to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in view of the importance of this matter, would it not be more appropriate for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to come into the House at some stage to put the arrangements on the record?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all hope there will be no bad news tomorrow, but are practical plans in place to deal with another outbreak, regardless of where it occurs? Is the Taoiseach aware that, as the person who has taken responsibility for managing the crisis, there is concern that he is not fully appraised of the enormity of the calamity that might occur? It should be taken into account that as late as last Wednesday the Taoiseach was insisting that his party's árd fheis should go ahead, bringing together 4,000 or 5,000 people from all parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Séamus Brennan, changed the position of the Government with respect to the intentions the Taoiseach had to put all the referenda legislation &ndash; covering four items, including the Treaty of Nice &ndash; through all Stages next week. The intention was that the referenda date would be 31 May, other conditions allowing. That position was changed following protests from all three parties represented at the Whips' meeting. On Tuesday and Wednesday next week, we will only have Second Stage of the legislation dealing with referendum proposals for the Treaty of Nice. Unless otherwise indicated, the intention still is that the vote on this item, perhaps with the other three legal referenda, will take place on 31 May. In view of the fact that Ireland is the only country that intends to have a referendum on the Treaty of Nice &ndash; and in view of the fact that it is important not just for Ireland but also for the European Union and, indeed, for the 12 applicant countries, in addition to Turkey which has yet to achieve full applicant status &ndash; would the Taoiseach agree that the country needs a comprehensive debate within the strictures of the law as determined by the Supreme Court? It is too soon to rush through legislation and subsequently have a debate on the Treaty of Nice, with a referendum on 31 May. This is a matter of supreme importance not just for the people of Ireland but also for the peoples of Europe. Will the Taoiseach reconsider the Government's commitment to have the referendum on 31 May and allow for a mature and considered debate over the summer months with a referendum date some time in the autumn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach or any of the Ministers who are sponsoring amendments had discussions with the Referendum Commission? Have the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs brought forward budgets to Cabinet to indicate the amount of money they believe should be spent by the Referendum Commission to ensure a fair debate and campaign, so that all views are represented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To reply to Deputy Noonan's question first, the sponsoring Ministers have to <Col N="1077" /> bring forward a budget for each of the referenda. That is being done under the terms of the Referendum Commission. Those figures have been prepared and the preliminary work has already been completed. The detailed work has to be completed within the coming days and that will be done.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Quinn's question, we gave more time to this important matter in the House last autumn than to the other referenda matters. Deputy Quinn was one of the people who sought that. Before we went to Nice I set out a number of comprehensive statements and papers, which Deputy Quinn supported. I was called on to do that and I gladly did so. We put the Government's position to the relevant committees of the House before going to Nice, and we did so afterwards. The Minister for Foreign Affairs spent a long period dealing with the matter in committee. We have already had far more extensive discussions on the Treaty of Nice than on the other referenda matters. I have no problem about having further debate in the House which can be agreed by the Whips. The Bills have to go through both Houses and I would like to deal with the matter before the summer but, as I made clear during the week, that will depend on the foot and mouth situation. If the foot and mouth position makes it impossible to hold the referendum, then we cannot have it and the situation does not arise. If possible, however, I would like to proceed with the referendum.</P>
      <P>I informed the Deputy &ndash; even though some of his colleagues have since used it against me &ndash; on a previous occasion that even if we were to have a political debate, it would be good to put the concept of enlargement to people. However, the advice of the Attorney General and the senior counsel &ndash; the latter advised on the Maastricht Treaty and also, possibily, on the Amsterdam Treaty &ndash; ran contrary to that. The Nice Treaty document is only one-third the size of the Amsterdam Treaty document. I am not sure how much time we devoted to the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty. The Nice Treaty has generated interest outside the country. For example, the European platform committee, which includes five Tory Euro sceptics on its executive, is already fund raising to try to influence the vote in this country. I do not believe that the Euro sceptics should be allowed to debate this issue during the summer. However, I am firmly in favour of a debate taking place in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is not possible to hold the referendum on 31 May, the preferred date, it will have to be held later. However, I believe we should proceed to deal with this matter. Ireland is the only country holding a referendum and other states are anxious that we should not unduly delay the process. I do not believe we are doing so. A great deal of discussion and debate has already taken place. If the Whips can agree a timeframe, I am open to considering it. Earlier this morning it was suggested to me that the debate should be held over four days. The debate on the Amsterdam <Col N="1078" /> Treaty, which was more complex, wide ranging and significant, did not last that long. If a reasonable timeframe can be agreed, I will not be found wanting in terms of agreeing to it.</P>

      <P>The European Parliament has yet to express its view on the merits or demerits of the Treaty of Nice. To the best of my knowledge no other Parliament has formally expressed or concluded its view on the treaty or its ratification. I am subject to correction but I believe member states have until 31 December 2002 to ratify the treaty and there are, therefore, 20 months in which the citizens of this State, not the Members elected to this Assembly, will decide on ratification. While a substantial debate took place on Committee Stage &ndash; but not on the floor of this Chamber &ndash; the people at large, who will ultimately decide on ratification, have had no real opportunity to debate the treaty because the final legal draft has only recently become available and the White Paper was only launched yesterday.</P>
      <P>I am concerned not so much about the amount of time devoted to the debate in the Houses, but about the amount of time that will be given to ordinary citizens outside to have the kind of debate which is warranted. The Taoiseach's desire, contrary to the opinion of many people in Government circles, particularly those with offices on the other side of St. Stephen's Green &ndash; to hold the referendum prior to the summer recess is aimed at clearing the decks for the Fianna Fáil Party, if it so chooses &ndash; the Progressive Democrats will have no choice in the matter &ndash; to create a window of opportunity to hold a general election in the autumn. I ask him to reconsider the position in order to allow the people to hold a proper debate on this matter and the information the Referendum Commission will provide during the summer and to hold the referendum early in the autumn, a full 14 months inside the time limit set down for ratification.</P>

      <P>I could wait until the end of next year to hold the referendum, but I would rather deal with it in the near future. I love arguments about the amount of effort and work invested in referendum campaigns. I have been involved in a number of those campaigns and it is always interesting to see what happens on the day. We must work hard to try to reach an agreement on this and that is what I am prepared to do.</P>
      <P>People cannot have it every way. It was first proposed that the treaty should be debated by a committee of the House; it was then suggested that a referendum should be held in order to give the people an opportunity to debate the matter and, finally, it was put to me that a debate should take place in the Dáil. I will take a fair approach in terms of reaching an agreement on dealing with this important issue. In so far as I can detect, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats are in favour of the treaty. In addition, the Greens throughout Europe, except those in Ireland, are also in favour of it. I hope we can reach agreement on a fair timeframe but I do not believe we should allow the debate to drag on. However, I am conscious of the fact that the foot and mouth outbreak may have an impact.</P>

      <P>With my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs, I attended the Stockholm European Council meeting on Friday and Saturday, 23 and 24 March. The Council was a successful one. It dealt with a wide range of economic and political issues and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will deal with the most important of these in our statements to the House. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs will deal in detail with the foreign relations issues dealt with at the Council, I will restrict my comments on these aspects to some brief words on the meeting with the Presidents of Russia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the Council have been laid before both Houses. Before I address the details of the summit, however, I would like to outline briefly the overall progress which is being made in building a European Union which makes a real difference to the day to day lives of the citizens of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will shortly have a referendum on the Nice Treaty and, inevitably, the usual litany of myths and distortions will be trotted out by those opposed to the treaty. Were one to believe the wilder assertions made by its opponents, the European Union has been an unmitigated politi<Col N="1085" /> cal, economic, social and cultural disaster for the nations and people of Europe.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be further from the truth. The European Union has created the framework within which its people have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. It has also created the framework within which Ireland and its people have managed to reach new levels of economic prosperity, international recognition and cultural confidence.</P>
    <P>The business conducted at the Stockholm Council reflected the reality of the European Union. At Stockholm we demonstrated our solidarity in the face of the threat from foot and mouth disease, which threatens the European agricultural sector; agreed to build on the good progress we have made towards achieving the target set as Lisbon and making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. As a result, the European Union will be capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion; set out an ambitious programme of measures to underpin the employment and social policy objectives of the members states of the Union; acted as a force for peace in the Balkans by offering timely support to the Macedonian government; and had a full political and economic dialogue with the Russian President.</P>
    <P>This is the real Europe. It is a Europe where, working together, the individual member states are building a more prosperous and a more socially inclusive European Union. It is a Europe where, through common action, the political, economic and social achievements of each member state are enhanced. This common action, achieved by forging consensus among the member states, may take time to put in place but, once in place, it will prove all the more effective.</P>
    <P>More importantly, it is a Europe where the member states are free to disagree with each other and can defend their national interests. At Stockholm, for example, we failed to agree on target dates for the full liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors. These were issues with which France, in particular, had real difficulties. The key difference between this type of disagreement and similar disagreements in Europe before the process of European integration began is that now the structures exist for the outstanding issues to be addressed on the basis of co-operation and compromise.</P>
    <P>In this instance, we have committed ourselves to further considering the timetable for liberalisation and have asked the Commission to evaluate these sectors further in its report to next year's spring European Council. Ireland has and will continue to play its part in building the European Union. The benefits accruing to our people make this an essential task.</P>
    <P>In the run up to the Council, Ireland made a number of important contributions to its preparation. On 19 January, in response to a letter from Prime Minister Persson, I outlined Ireland's priorities for the Council, which included the <Col N="1086" /> mainstreaming of the social inclusion agenda, the promotion of lifelong learning and the implementation of the financial services action plan. In addition, Prime Minister Persson visited Dublin on 26 February and we had a full exchange of views on the agenda for the Council.</P>
    <P>In early March, Ireland submitted a paper entitled Better Regulation through Partnership, which highlighted the importance of ensuring the right quantity and quality of regulation. It was an appropriate time to focus on regulatory reform as a tool to give the European Union a competitive advantage as a global player. Such reform can also serve to bring the Union closer to its citizens and to protect consumer interests.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland participated with Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom on a basic skills project as a valuable input to the development of a lifelong learning strategy at European level. Furthermore, following on from our joint contribution to Lisbon last year, Prime Minister Blair and myself submitted a joint paper to Prime Minister Persson on 8 March which highlighted the need for further action in the areas of employment for women, skills and lifelong learning, implementing the European Research Area and agreeing the community patent. All of these contributions played an important role in signalling to our European partners the Irish priorities for the summit.</P>
    <P>The core business of the Stockholm European Council was ensuring further progress on the economic and social agenda of the European Union. The meeting produced a number of important results which will, over the coming years, bear fruit in terms of better policies and better economic and social performance at European level. I will give some examples of that.</P>
    <P>The European Council addressed the demographic challenge of an ageing population of which people of working age constitute an ever smaller part; discussed how to create more and better jobs, accelerate economic reform, modernise the European social model and harness new technologies; issued strategic guidance for the broad economic policy guidelines to achieve sustained growth and stable macro economic conditions; and agreed to improve procedures so that the European Council's spring meeting will become the focal point for an annual review of economic and social questions.</P>
    <P>The demographic challenge facing the Union is considerable with substantial increases projected in the number of retired people as a percentage of the working population. To meet this challenge and to ensure all European citizens have the opportunity to meet their full potential, the European Council adopted three new targets for EU wide employment rates. In Lisbon, the Council set targets for 2010 of 70% overall and 60% for women. In Stockholm, to ensure that the achievement of these targets is kept in focus, we set interim targets for 2005 of 67% overall and 57% for women. Member states are to consider setting corresponding targets in their national employ<Col N="1087" /> ment plans. In addition, we agreed to set an EU target for increasing the average EU employment rate among women and men aged 55 to 64 to 50% by 2010. These targets are fully in accord with Ireland's own employment policies.</P>
    <P>To ensure the employment potential of the European Union is maximised and the increasing number of retired people have the fullest possible opportunity to provide for supplementary pensions, the Commission has been mandated to present to the 2002 spring European Council an action plan on opening up new European labour markets as well as specific proposals for the recognition of qualifications and the portability of supplementary pensions. To ensure the quality as well as the quantity of jobs improve, indicators on the quality of work and the reality of gender equality in the workforce are to be developed by the relevant Councils of Ministers and the Commission. With the introduction of euro notes and coins now only nine months away, the time is ideal for the acceleration of economic reform. The heads of state and Government agreed that well functioning markets are vital for increasing consumer benefits and creating an entrepreneurial environment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important achievement of the Council was the agreement to fast track the development of a common approach to the regulation of financial services within the European Union. Ireland has strongly supported for many years the implementation of the financial services action plan. The implementation of this plan has been subject to lengthy delays which have prevented Europe taking full advantage of the benefits of the Single Market. It was a key Irish priority that this aspect of the Union's agenda be given added impetus by the European Council.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the Council were most encouraging in this regard. In particular, the European Council approved the resolution on more effective securities market regulation and considers it constitutes a good platform for effective co-operation between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in this area. It agreed that the financial services action plan should be fully implemented by 2005, with every effort made by all parties concerned to achieve an integrated securities market by the end of 2003 by giving priority to securities markets legislation provided for in the plan. It also endorsed the objective of a well functioning risk capital market by 2003 through the implementation of the risk capital action plan. While the terminology in this area is technical, the effects of this agreement will be profound. It will be reflected in easier access to capital and in better and more competitive financial services which will, in turn, result in more jobs, better pensions and cheaper financial services for the people and companies of Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland has over the years pressed for the promotion of social inclusion at European level. I welcome, therefore, the fact that the Council <Col N="1088" /> recognised that the fight against social exclusion is of the utmost importance for the Union. It was agreed that priority should be given by the member states to implementing national action plans on combating poverty and social exclusion to progress on the basis of the common objectives agreed in Nice. The aim at the European Council is that the proposal for a social inclusion programme be agreed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased that the Council supported the committed and active involvement of social partners in implementing reform, the success of which requires commitment from employers and workers at the grassroots. This commitment to social partnership was made no less pleasing by the fact that the Council endorsed the setting up as soon as possible of the European Observatory for Industrial Change as part of the Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. This development will reinforce the role of the foundation, which is based in Loughlinstown, in supporting the development of European policy in this area.</P>
    <P>There was a full debate on the situation in the agricultural sector at the European Council. The Council welcomed and stressed the importance of effective co-operation among national authorities and endorsed the thorough measures being taken by the Council, the Commission and the member states. The Council expressed its determination, a determination fully shared by the Government and myself, to contain and ultimately eradicate foot and mouth disease and BSE.</P>
    <P>The European Council also issued a declaration on climate change which reaffirmed the EU's strong commitment to the Kyoto protocol and urged all negotiating partners to engage constructively in implementing it. I regret the US announcement that it will no longer pursue the implementation of the protocol. Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners and other like minded countries to seek a way towards the full implementation of Kyoto.</P>
    <P>The European Council had a meeting and lunch with the Russian President at which we indicated our support for the modernisation of the Russian economy and the building of a genuine partnership between Russia and the EU based on common values. In this context, we expressed our strong concern over the situation in Chechnya and stressed the need for a political solution of the conflict as a matter of urgency. We also had a meeting with President Trajkovski of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at which we reaffirmed our support for a peaceful and negotiated solution to problems in the region.</P>
    <P>During the Council I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Blair where we assessed the current situation in Northern Ireland. I took the opportunity of the meeting to express my support for the United Kingdom's efforts to eradicate foot and mouth disease and asked that the most stringent measures be taken to ensure traffic <Col N="1089" /> between our two countries posed no risk of spreading the disease.</P>
    <P>The European Council in Stockholm marked an important milestone for the European Union in that it showed that Europe is committed at the highest level to the achievement of the objective set at Lisbon. It proved once again, if further proof were required, that the European Union works and that it does so for the benefit of all its members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the progress, although slow, made at this Council on a number of issues. I congratulate the Swedish Presidency on its conduct of the affairs of the Union. I note the progress towards a unified risk capital market, the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets and the greater co-ordination of national combat poverty plans.</P>
      <P>We are, to the great advantage of the economy, playing an increasing part in the provision of international financial services. The developments at the IFSC, Shannon and elsewhere have created good jobs for many of our well qualified graduates. The European Council's consideration of two matters, the financial services action plan and the creation of a unified risk capital market, should assist the further development of our financial services sector. I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance will be to the forefront in efforts to achieve the risk capital market by 2003.</P>
      <P>Now that the decision in principle has been taken to liberalise the gas and electricity markets, I urge the Government to ensure the ESB and Bord Gáis are put in a position to gain the maximum possible benefit from the liberalisation. I am concerned about the slow progress in the first phase of electricity liberalisation in Ireland and the many difficulties being experienced by prospective new entrants to the market. These problems must be addressed as a matter of urgency if our energy sector is to remain competitive in a fully liberalised European Union market. We, on this side of the House, have been uneasy with the relationships the Minister for Public Enterprise has had with many of the State-sponsored bodies in her remit. Her record of interference in their affairs, of confrontation with their senior management and of intolerance of points of view other than her own has stifled the talent of these organisations and impeded their development. The ESB and Bord Gáis have the experience and skills needed to take advantage of EU liberalisation. I ask that they be given the freedom and the encouragement to get on with it because they have not got that from the present incumbent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis at the Council on the development of policies to promote social inclusion. The agreement to give the Council a central role in monitoring progress in the implementation of national action plans to combat poverty and social exclusion is important. It will provide a useful external check on the wealth <Col N="1090" /> oriented policies of some member states, including our own at times. It will help to reinforce Fine Gael's version of a genuine Irish social contract towards which we should all work. It is extremely ironic that a quarter of an hour after the Taoiseach again rejected our views on the Sinnott case he stated it is Government policy, which he promulgated at Stockholm, to encourage lifelong learning. Even though this is the central issue being challenged by the Government in the Supreme Court, it is actually a priority in Ireland's foreign affairs policy now. I think that is deeply ironic.</P>
    <P>I come now to the European Council's focus on the current foot and mouth disease crisis. While realising that the arrangements for the meeting were essentially in the hands of a non-agricultural country, and one which has not itself felt the pain of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, I am disappointed that the Taoiseach did not find it possible to join with like minded countries to achieve a greater focus on the problem which will eventually impact directly or indirectly on all member states.</P>
    <P>In my statement on Friday last I called on the Taoiseach to convey to the British Prime Minister the unease and concern of the Irish people at the way in which the control of disease is being handled in Britain. I have no idea what the Taoiseach might have said privately to the Prime Minister &ndash; he has not told us in his statement &ndash; but I know what he said publicly. He focused on criticising aspects of the handling of the situation in Northern Ireland, the area in the United Kingdom where action has been most decisive and most effective. We are all taking pride in the part which the Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister, Bríd Rodgers, is playing in managing the crisis. Her actions are a fitting monument to the SDLP's 30 years of commitment to constructive politics. I congratulate her on her most recent achievement of securing from the EU for Northern Ireland the regional status which will enable it shortly to resume exporting meat and dairy exports to other European Union countries.</P>
    <P>The problem that I ask the Taoiseach to address, the heart of the foot and mouth disease problem, is across the water, not across the Border. The carefully crafted institutions set up under the Belfast Agreement have shown themselves to be capable of working well in the interests of all the people of this island. The Taoiseach should be supporting not knocking the spirit of co-operation which clearly prevails between the authorities on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with two points relating to foot and mouth disease. While in Stockholm, the Taoiseach responded in the negative to my request for support for those businesses, especially in the tourist industry, which are, after the farming section itself, most severely damaged by the outbreak. Nevertheless, while visiting County Louth over the weekend, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, said he would be bringing proposals to Government to alleviate the difficulties in tourism. I wish <Col N="1091" /> to ask the Taoiseach who is making Government policy, who is in charge, why the mixed messages? The Taoiseach must tell the House what is the Government response to my request. Is it the Taoiseach's negative in Stockholm or is it the quasi-positive response of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in Carlingford? </P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make regarding foot and mouth relates to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. It is some time since the media exposed in some detail the cross-Border sheep smuggling racket. Following these revelations, what did the Minister do? Did he have the matter investigated and what investigations, other than those taken by the Revenue Commissioners, were carried out? What were the conclusions of any investigations carried out at the Minister's instigation and what follow-up action was taken? Were extra cross-Border patrols put in place and additional Garda resources allocated to deal with the problem? If, on the one hand, no investigation was carried out, may I ask why not? Was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform simply hoping for the best and was smuggling not included in the zero tolerance approach? These are important questions which I ask the Taoiseach to address without delay.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has spoken of the Kyoto Agreement and the seeming decision by the United States authorities, as revealed by President Bush, not to implement the Kyoto Treaty in the United States. I have read the Taoiseach's script very quickly but I do not think that his references to Kyoto are included in the script which has been distributed. I wish to question the Taoiseach on it during Taoiseach's Questions. In so far as I understand the Taoiseach's policy position, I support it and we should do everything possible within an EU context to ensure that the Kyoto objectives are implemented in full.</P>
    <P>I will now give some of my time to my colleague, Deputy Durkan, chairperson of the European Affairs committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House and my party leader for the opportunity to speak. It appears to me that the Stockholm Summit did not address the lack of cohesive action on the part of the EU and I can think of a number of instances over the last few years. The French truckers' strike last year had an impact on the whole European Union, especially in relation to fuel prices. The European Union did not take cohesive action. The French Government took unilateral action. Subsequently, the British Government took unilateral action and, as result, the rest of the European Union followed to a greater or lesser extent. That is not the way the EU is supposed to proceed. The action should be taken at the top level so that each member state will fall into line in so far as it can and any State which is unable to do so should say so. There has been an inability on the part of the EU in recent times to make a decision and stand over it. It has failed to give a <Col N="1092" /> signal to those both within and without the EU that it is taking that decision.</P>
      <P>I note that the agricultural situation was discussed at the Stockholm Summit. However, I do not think the summit dealt adequately with the situation. It dealt superficially with it. It did not recognise that the regime in relation to animal health and consumer protection within the EU has failed. It has failed to deal with the BSE crisis and now the foot and mouth disease. The EU seems to be unable to act as a unit. This is so because it suits different individual countries to operate in different fashions.</P>
      <P>Operating under the guise of freedom of movement, it has become possible to import into this country and to export from other member states animals and products that did not have the required status. The freedom of movement proposals were never intended to allow a situation to develop whereby the food chain was going to be put at risk, not just in one member state, but throughout the Union. The risk applies to everybody and it is a very serious matter. There are those across the water in the UK who seem to feel that it only affects 10% of their economy, the agricultural sector. There are much wider implications for the whole EU economy. It has very serious implications for our economy because we are an exporting nation. We export our food products and, as a result, the impact on our economy is considerably greater.</P>
      <P>The European Union should have taken serious issue with the assessment of the present situation. It should have set out a formula to ensure that there is not a repetition in the future. We heard yesterday at the European Affairs committee meeting that it is quite common for imported food ingredients from outside the EU to be further processed and labelled within the Union. The Union has no control over the quality of the regimes operated in the countries of origin. I am aware these matters are covered by various EU regulations and instruments but it was never intended that they would operate in the manner they do. Serious risks are posed to the health of EU citizens by the continuance of these practices.</P>
      <P>In recent years, I and countless other Members have raised questions about the importation of meat and meat products into this country and other EU member states. Once a product gets into one member state, it can circulate throughout the EU thereby presenting a very serious problem to the entire food chain. I am disappointed that a greater emphasis was not placed on this issue at the recent summit as it presented an ideal opportunity for discussion. A mere paragraph is contained in part 2 of the Presidency Conclusions on this matter. The degree of detail required to show this issue is being seriously addressed was not in evidence. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach will ensure at the next summit that the fears and concerns expressed in this House, in the North and throughout other EU countries will be met with appropriate actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> Deputy Noonan spoke about climate change and the US decision on emissions. I presume the participants in the summit were not aware of the impending US decision which has an impact on the rest of the world, particularly in view of the high degree to which the US contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases. I do not understand how the US could have made such a decision without reference to the EU, particularly as the previous US Administration had agreed to pursue a particular policy. The conclusions also refer to climate change. Perhaps the Minister will outline the extent, if any, to which the summit was aware of the impending US decision.</P>
    <P>The summit did not adequately address &ndash; nor has the issue been adequately addressed for years &ndash; the question of a European vision and Europe's future direction, notwithstanding the Treaty of Nice and the views advanced by various member states. There is evidently a void in Europe at present in that there is no major or senior personality acting as a driving force in this area. In the past, there was always somebody in the European arena who was regarded as &ldquo;Mr. Europe&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;who do I contact in the event of a crisis?&rdquo; to paraphrase Henry Kissinger's words. This void stems from the fact that some member states have different priorities. Some wish to proceed at a faster rate that the rest of the Union can accommodate while others are proceeding at a slower rate. The member states in the middle are faced with a dilemma. It is important that this issue would be tackled at the next summit. There must be recognition with the EU and outside it of a person or a number of people who will drive Europe forward as a unit and who will make Europe recognised and respected throughout the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The harmonisation of taxation policies will arise again. I note the reference to taxation matters in the conclusions and this is an issue on which I would welcome the Minister's views. It is advantageous for us to have our own tax regimes but we must have regard to other areas of taxation. There are several other issues to which I would like to refer but time constraints do not permit me to do so.</P>

      <P>This summit took place against the background of the Treaty of Nice. I reiterate my earlier comments on the importance for Ireland that the treaty be comprehensively debated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs may wish to outline his views on the necessity for such a debate outside these Houses. I compliment the Minister on the quality of the White Paper published yesterday and on the manner of its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Stockholm spring council is the second of what is described in EU jargon as the &ldquo;Lisbon <Col N="1094" /> process&rdquo;, a process initiated this time last year to run for ten years. That process dictates that during the annual spring council meeting of the EU Presidency, progress would be monitored and targets set would be evaluated with a view to creating one of the most, if not the most, dynamic economic areas in the world. I welcome some of the progress which has been made and I welcome the contribution of the Government in setting targets which it has, in some cases, achieved.</P>
    <P>While recognising the progress made, I put it to the Taoiseach that in regard to the necessity to increase the numbers of people participating in the workforce at European level and to provide for the renewal of the ageing European workforce &ndash; although Ireland is some decades behind the ageing cohort relative to other European countries &ndash; we have a problem in regard to the administration of proper work visas to people coming to work here from outside the European economic area. Yesterday's revelations that Filipino nurses attracted here to work and care for Irish people are living in what can only be described as conditions unfit for pigs is an indictment on all of us. I commend the trade union official and the other people involved for revealing this scandal.</P>
    <P>If we invite people into the working environment of the EU, they are entitled to the same conditions and rights which the European labour movement has succeeded in putting on the Statute Book. I urge the Taoiseach to introduce legislation to provide for work visas, as distinct from work permits, for people coming to work here. A work permit is effectively the property of the employer as both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, having formerly served as Ministers with responsibility for labour matters, will be aware whereas a work visa entitles people to work anywhere in the economy rather than being tied to a particular place of employment and employer. If the Filipino nurses and others were here on proper work visas, they would not be living in the exploitative conditions revealed yesterday. Speeded up action is necessary in that respect. I commend to the Taoiseach the Labour Party's policy on asylum seekers and immigration in which we said that, in line with the projected estimates of incoming workers into the economy, 10,000 work visas should be issued per annum for ten years and that, in the first year, they should be offered on a first refusal basis to the 15,000 asylum seekers in the State who have yet to have their appeals properly processed. Many of them are economic migrants and offering them work visas would deal with two pertinent issues.</P>
    <P>One is the growing level of intolerance and racism manifest in some parts of the country because people believe outsiders receive benefits which ordinary citizens cannot yet receive. That understandably generates a certain degree of tension. The other issue is that it would enable many asylum seekers in Ireland to do what they wanted to do in the first place, which is to work. The <Col N="1095" /> slowness with which the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have introduced this legislation is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Regarding the financial services action plan, the Taoiseach's report to the House is relatively glossy and much more optimistic than yesterday's second editorial in the <i>Financial Times</i> which referred to the regulation of the European financial markets:</P>
    <P>Ostensibly, Stockholm was a success, allowing Tony Blair and others to proclaim faster progress toward a single European financial market by 2004. But, under pressure from Germany, leaders have agreed to an undesirable compromise that could make regulation of financial services more cumbersome.</P>
    <P>The drawbacks are threefold. First, the deal upsets the delicate balance between European Union institutions and the powerful new Securities Committee made up of experts from member states. Second, it could give a <i>de facto</i> veto to big countries. Third, it risks antagonising the European Parliament, which already feels cut out of the process.</P>
    <P>The deal would effectively force the European Commission to drop proposals on &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; issues that face &ldquo;predominant&rdquo; opposition in the member states. This is a retreat from earlier wording that would have allowed regulatory proposals to go through unless there was a clear or &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; majority against.</P>
    <P>The previous presumption in favour of the Commission &ndash; now overturned &ndash; had stirred suspicions in the City of London and Frankfurt. But it contained an important commitment from the Commission to consult fully and openly with market participants at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The editorial goes on but I will not take the time to quote the rest of it except to quote from its concluding paragraph:</P>
    <P>It is time for all sides to adhere to the spirit of give and take in the Lamfalussy plan. Now the Council has made its power-grab, the parliament must be given adequate guarantees that its own views will be taken into account. That is part of a democratic process. It is also vital if the ambition for speedier and more effective legislation in financial services is to be realised.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Government, if they are still in office next spring, or their successors, should have as a priority on the agenda for next spring's council, progress on the full implementation of the Lamfalussy plan. The action taken by the Germans in respect of this will frustrate the very thing the Taoiseach said was desirable, namely, realising the full potential of the euro zone and the financial markets which depend on <Col N="1096" /> the liberalisation of movements of capital, properly regulated and supervised, in the euro zone.</P>
    <P>On the Taoiseach's reference to the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets and following on the comments of Deputy Noonan, the Labour Party does not have any confidence in the political ability or ministerial competence of the Minister for Public Enterprise. Her political skills are undoubted. She comes from a highly politically skilled family with a long tradition of political performance in the State. However, her stewardship of the Department of Public Enterprise leaves much to be desired. We are fearful of the manner in which liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets will be take place in Ireland as long as she remains Minister. I share the concerns already expressed and which have been articulated on more than one occasion by my colleague, Deputy Stagg. We need an effective energy market and security of supply to respect and recognise Ireland's strategic interests. To do that, we need the legislation to be brought forward to give effect to it. It is inexplicable why the necessary legislation at domestic level is not brought forward.</P>
    <P>Regarding the reference to climate change, which was not included in the Taoiseach's speech but is no doubt available to Members, any commentators who cynically stated there was no difference between George W. Bush and Al Gore will see the real difference on the international stage. The idea that Al Gore, were he President, would unilaterally tear up the United States commitment to the Kyoto Protocol is inconceivable. The fact a report in the <i>Financial Times</i> today states that the Republican dominated Congress would probably not ratify the Kyoto Accord does not necessarily excuse the United States President for unilaterally abandoning it.</P>
    <P>It is a return to a worrisome trait along the corridors of power in the most powerful country in the world of a take-it-or-leave-it unilateralism, where the most powerful country can decide to arbitrate global issues exclusively on the basis of what is in the best interests of the United States. It is a mixture of international swagger and domestic isolationism which does not bode well for this century. In that context and notwithstanding the sensitivity of the relationship Ireland must have with the United States, will the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicate in his reply, because this decision was made since the Stockholm Council meeting, whether Ireland will use its position on the Security Council to raise the issue of the unilateral abandoning by the United States of its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol? That protocol is a United Nations initiative.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity to deal at European level with the issue of food safety and security. My colleague, Deputy Upton, has drawn attention on a number of occasions to the fact that the traditional relationship between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and producers and consumers has gone well past its sell-by date, if I can borrow a phrase from the <Col N="1097" /> shelves of supermarkets throughout Europe. It is not just in this country. Geoffrey Lean, writing in the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> made precisely the same observation about the British Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries. It is time to end the unhealthy relationship between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the European Commission and consumers and people who depend on European produced food for health and growth.</P>
    <P>The lessons of unregulated and unknown food and animal movements are frightening. The revelation by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in the House of Commons earlier this week of millions of sheep moving in Britain in February has come as a great surprise to most, but perhaps not to some in the relevant Departments of Agriculture. The continued confusion between the Ministers, Bríd Rodgers and Deputy Walsh, and their officials as to what happened to the 60-odd sheep which disappeared somewhere between Meigh in Armagh and Roscommon and wherever else south of the Border is evidence of that. We must reconstruct the relationship of agriculture with producers and consumers. That can only happen at European level.</P>
    <P>We will have another opportunity to debate other aspects of the outcome of Stockholm. The pattern whereby the Minister for Foreign Affairs went to the relevant Oireachtas committee was useful in that questions and answers were explored in a more comprehensive way and issues were explored in a manner satisfactory to committee members.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that in the run up to the referendum on the Nice Treaty, members of the Fianna Fáil Party will portray themselves as great Europeans because, while their body language may be European, in their souls they are American. To put it at its crudest, the Berliners are on this side of the House while the Bostonites are on the other side.</P>

      <P>Members on the Government side and people in industry will breath a sigh of relief today because President Bush has torn up the Kyoto protocol. Ireland has fully embraced the American model and we cannot under any circumstances meet our commitments under the protocol. Ireland was given a good deal in that it was allowed to go 13% above 1990 levels, but even that cannot be attained. The papers produced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, are useless. They do not contain any commitments to introducing eco or energy taxes, which are vital if Ireland is to meet its commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the positive aspects of Stockholm was that European leaders showed that they were different. They called on President Bush to honour the Kyoto commitments and Ireland supported that call. However, the problem is that the <Col N="1098" /> Government today did not issue an unequivocal condemnation of President Bush. I call on the Government to issue such a condemnation. I regard President Bush as an intellectual pygmy who is grossly irresponsible. He should be a pariah as far as Europe is concerned, but that is not obvious in the comments of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Such a step would show that Ireland belongs to the European camp and does not have a foot in the American camp.</P>
    <P>The details of global warming are well known, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs should remember in any talks he has with his counterparts that the latest reports from the UN show that it will have catastrophic effects worldwide. I do not understand the attitude of the Americans, but perhaps it is related to the fact that we are all caught in an economic growth paradigm from which we cannot escape. We are totally dependent on fossil fuels to the extent that we have become fossil fuel junkies and this needs to be radically changed. Unfortunately, this attitude is not shared by the Government or the Bush Administration. I agree with Deputy Quinn that Al Gore, if he had been elected, would have held a different view.</P>
    <P>If one considers the difference between the current and former Presidents of the United States, former President Clinton was a colossus compared to President Bush who will send the planet down the tubes if he continues in his current fashion. According to the UN, by 2100, tropical diseases will have spread to the US because of global warming. Many African deserts will have expanded and alpine glaciers will have melted. Tropical cyclones will have forced millions of people to flee Asia. There will be ecological rather than economic migrants because of global warming.</P>
    <P>Regarding people's participation in European affairs and debates, there have been abysmally low turn outs in the last number of referenda. This is indicative of the fact that many people feel removed from Europe. This will continue because of further centralisation in Europe. People discuss subsidiarity, but few appear to understand or enact it. An increasing number of people are likely to become disenchanted with the European project. The Nice Treaty moves us away from a partnership of equals, which was the reason people joined the EU. Unfortunately and undeniably, a two tier and two speed Europe is being created. This is a worrying development in the EU. We want more people to participate in the debate, but the opposite effect will be created and, as I said previously, more right wing parties are likely to emerge. I am aware that right wing parties throughout Europe are experiencing a backlash, but that relates to internal party reasons. In the longer term, parties which are highly critical of EU developments will emerge.</P>
    <P>I regard myself as a European, but I do not like the direction Europe is taking. I particularly dislike the fact that the development of European security and defence policy will result in Ireland moving towards a European defence union. This <Col N="1099" /> will mean increased military spending. My view is that more money should not be spent on tanks and guns, but should be invested in health, education and the environment. There is no reason that Ireland should partake in the creation of a European superstate. Many members of the Green Party abroad consider that vital to counteract the US. This may be the view particularly of Joschka Fischer of the Germans Greens. However, we should not let that dictate our way of thinking. Traditionally, Ireland has been supreme in terms of peacekeeping throughout the world. However, Ireland has had to cut back on its commitments in the Lebanon and elsewhere. This is disappointing for many people who have been committed to Irish neutrality and peacekeeping efforts over many years.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take the issue of global warming seriously when he and the Taoiseach meet their counterparts. They should state that Ireland finds President George W. Bush's actions in tearing up the Kyoto protocol unacceptable. His decision is alarming and can only be bad for humanity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the statements on the European Council is to place on record what happened in Stockholm. I take Deputy Quinn's point and I look forward to a more detailed debate of individual aspects and related matters that have been raised. I have no problem discussing these issues in detail at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or the Joint Committee on European Affairs which may be better fora for them.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to some of the wider political issues that were discussed for the purpose of accuracy and the record of the House. I will refer to some of the issues mentioned by Members during this short debate. I intend to address the external relations issues discussed at Stockholm. The Taoiseach dealt with the economic aspects of European Union-Russian relations. Views on a broad range of economic and policy area were exchanged. The discussion focused on enhancing co-operation and relations with Kaliningrad in the context of enlargement on which the Commission has published a detailed paper &ndash; this was broadly welcomed by Russia; co-operation under the northern dimension, an initiative that focuses on the countries bordering the Baltic Sea and on the north west Russian regions; the further development of the energy dialogue between Russia and the EU; and Russia's accession to the WTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was clear the European Council recognised that there can be no long-term stability without a lasting partnership with Russia. The European Council agreed to develop the political and strategic relationship with Russia while stressing that a genuine partnership in all areas must be based on common values. In relation to the Kyoto protocol and the discussions or the statements that have been made from the US President, clearly <Col N="1100" /> this Government welcomes the support of everyone in the House in regard to conveying our concern to the EU Presidency and the Swedish Prime Minister. There was support for the objective of President Putin to enhance the rule of law and democracy. The Heads of State and Government reiterated their serious concerns at the situation in Chechnya and stressed the need for a full and transparent investigation of human rights abuses and concrete progress towards a lasting political solution.</P>
    <P>Discussions at the European Council in relation to the Western Balkans focused on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. EU Foreign Ministers were briefed by the Presidency and the High Representative, Javier Solana, on the outcome of his visit to Skopje the previous day. The issue was one of the main subjects discussed with the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, in our joint meeting with him. He informed us of his recent visit to the region.</P>
    <P>On Friday evening, the European Council met the President and Foreign Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, and had the opportunity of hearing at first hand the actions their Government was taking to cope with the crisis in the area around Tetovo.</P>
    <P>The European Council issued a strong declaration urging the Macedonian Government to continue to respond in a restrained manner to the crisis and reaffirmed our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of FYROM and the inviolability of its borders. We welcomed the determination of the elected leaders of the ethnic Albanian community to remain committed to the democratic process and their renunciation of violence and assured them that the Union will be ready to assist the necessary internal political and economic reforms in order to consolidate FYROM's multi-ethnic society. The EU intends to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 9 April, making it the first country in the region to be linked to the EU through this new instrument.</P>
    <P>The European Council also called on the ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo to dissociate themselves from the Albanian extremists in FYROM and to condemn the violence unconditionally as the Government of Albania has already done. In this regard, I welcome the statement made last weekend by the leaders of the three main political parties in Kosovo calling on the extremist groups to lay down their weapons and return to their homes.</P>
    <P>With the apparently successful action earlier this week by the Macedonian military in dislodging the extremists from their positions around Tetovo, I hope measures will now be taken by all sides to reduce tensions and restore peace in the region. When this has been achieved, the legitimate grievances of the Albanian community in FYROM must be addressed in accordance with normal democratic principles. The European <Col N="1101" /> Union High Representative, Javier Solana, will continue to be actively involved in the issue and will make recommendations to the Council.</P>
    <P>On the Middle East peace process, great concern was expressed in our discussions at the very serious situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories and the mounting toll of casualties there. At the European Council in Stockholm, we recalled the declaration issued in Berlin in March 1999 which made clear our position that there could not be a veto on Palestinian self-determination, including the right to statehood. We reaffirmed our determination that the EU should make a more effective contribution to peace, stability and future prosperity in the Middle East. We called on other international donors urgently to join the European Union in pledging funding in support of the Palestinian budget. Israel must lift its closures and transfer the funds owed to the Palestinian Authority, which for its part must adopt a very strict budget, act against corruption and move towards democratic transparency. The European Union will continue to seek a way forward which will see an end to violence and the resumption of negotiations of an agreement within the framework of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. To that end, Javier Solana will stay in close touch with all the parties and report to the Gothenburg European Council on how the European Union can play an enhanced role in promoting the resumption of the peace process.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been seeking to play an active and constructive role in building peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. At the Stockholm European Council, our discussions focused on the contribution of the European Union to the efforts of building peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. In this context, we emphasised the commitment of the EU to contribute further to reducing tension between North and South Korea and to enhance the role of the Union support of peace, security and freedom on the Korean Peninsula. It is the expressed hope of partners that this enhanced EU commitment will expedite the holding of a second inter-Korean Summit and the implementation of the Joint Declaration made by the two Koreas in June 2000.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Persson of Sweden will visit Pyongyang and Seoul, representing the European Union, for talks with Presidents Kim-Jong-il and Kim Dae-jung on the full range of issues of concern to them and the EU, including, <i>inter alia</i>, disarmament and non-proliferation, human rights and humanitarian issues.</P>
    <P>On the foot and mouth issue, the situation in the agricultural sector was the subject of extensive debate in Stockholm following the recurrence of BSE and the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in several EU countries. The European Council expressed its concern about the severity of the situation in the agricultural sector and its solidarity with farmers and others in rural communities. It welcomed and stressed the importance of effective co-operation among <Col N="1102" /> national authorities and endorsed the thorough measures being taken by the Council, Commission and member states. In particular, the European Council expressed its determination to contain and ultimately eradicate foot and mouth disease and BSE.</P>
    <P>The importance of a food chain which is safe and sustainable in order to restore consumer confidence was underlined by the Council. Third countries were urged to lift measures which were not proportionate to either the extent of the problem or to the precautionary principle. The need for Community measures to respect the financial perspective was also stressed.</P>
    <P>The European Council invited the Council and the European Parliament to ensure the decision on the establishment of a European food authority was taken before the end of this year. The Taoiseach underlined the Government's serious concern about the situation in relation to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and informed his colleagues of the position here following confirmation of the case in County Louth on 22 March. The Taoiseach welcomed the solidarity and support of his fellow EU leaders for the plight of farmers and others affected by the outbreak of the disease. He endorsed the co-operation and commitment of the veterinary authorities throughout the EU in their efforts to contain the problem.</P>
    <P>On the Nice Treaty debate, there is more prospect of a comprehensive focus on public debate in the time scale we have outlined between now and May than perhaps would be the case if there was a long drawn out debate continuing until the autumn or beyond. It behoves us as Members of the Oireachtas and political parties to lead that public debate. I look forward to the Second Stage debate beginning here next week on the treaty. It behoves all of us who agree that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote is in the interests of the country, Europe and enlargement generally to try to devise a means by which we can get that wider public debate. I look to the social partners, the Council of the European Movement, the Institute of European Affairs and those who oppose the views I and others express in this House in support of it to engage in the debate. I am very anxious that the merits of the arguments are discussed in detail and comprehensively addressed. I believe in the overwhelmingly positive balance sheet, so to speak, in relation to Ireland's membership of the Union and the importance of Ireland pro-actively displaying its commitment, not just to the Union in its present state of development but to the dynamic that is inherent in how the European Union is developing. It is of crucial importance for peace and security in Europe, quite apart from economic issues, that progressive democratic forces in the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe get a positive signal from a country such as Ireland. This is something to which we as a people should give great consideration in ensuring there is a large turnout in the referendum. We should show we care beyond our <Col N="1103" /> own borders or interests and show our concern for others who will be given this historic opportunity, should there be a positive vote in Ireland and obviously parliamentary approval in the other 14 countries. This will allow families, young people and others who have the very same ambitions, hopes and concerns as we have to have a better quality of life and opportunity in their own countries in central and eastern Europe. It behoves us, and will say much about how we see ourselves in the world, to be prepared to support the Nice Treacy which is the vehicle by which the political imperative and political inevitability of an enlargement can take place in a structured, orderly and comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley should not be surprised about the European-ness of Fianna Fáil. It was the party who promoted this idea in the first instance and it was very much the Lemass view. At one time, we saw it as a move away from unhealthy dependence on Britain. We now see it very much in its international perspective. It is clear in the globalised world in which we live that Ireland can achieve far more in common with others than it can in isolation. I would put forward that argument in support of the treaty. It is one of the political arguments which we can discuss.</P>

      <P>On the Nice Treacy debate, it is important within political organisations to try to activate our activists on the ground at all levels. Regardless of whether they are for or against the treaty, it is important that people become engaged.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Gormley's concern about the extent to which there is a real nexus of interest between the institutions and the people on the ground. One of the proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference of 2004 is to address this issue to see how we can delineate the competencies and ensure people see the relevance of these institutions and know what the European Union is doing. It is a central part of everyday life but, for many reasons on which we should perhaps reflect, citizens do not see the relevance of Europe in the everyday affairs of Ireland and other countries in Europe and throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the statements made by the US President on the Kyoto Protocol. I welcome the support of all Members in conveying our concerns on these issues.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Message from Seanad. - Fisheries (Amendment)" RHead="Bill, 2000 : Second Stage">
    <Title>Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Early enactment of the Bill is needed to fill two important gaps in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, to enable the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board to do its work in as effective, efficient and transparent a way as possible. The board is a key element of the comprehensive and transparent aquaculture licensing arrangements established under the 1997 Act. The Bill was passed by Seanad Éireann on 20 June 2000. Before dealing with the Bill, it is appropriate for me to comment on aquaculture licensing generally. My concluding remarks will point the way for accelerating the sustainable growth of aquaculture which is in the national interest.</P>
      <P>A solid licensing framework is in place to facilitate the sustainable development of aquaculture to its full potential. Aquaculture provides more than 3,000 jobs, has an annual income of £67 million and has enormous potential for increases in both areas. I am determined to ensure that the licensing framework works as effectively and speedily as possible in the interests of both the industry and the public whose support is essential.</P>
      <P>Since I spoke here in December 1998 on the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill, 1998, I have secured substantial progress in processing the huge arrears of licence applications which had built up over the years while the licensing law was being reformed and made operational. A total of 347 licences, comprising 319 aquaculture licences and 28 trial licences for aquaculture purposes, have been granted compared with an annual average of approximately 70 licences granted for aquaculture purposes in previous years. Licensing decisions have been made in a further 35 cases, of which 30 await the end of the one month appeal period before licences can issue in any event, and five await the determination of the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board on appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 250 applications on hands, which my Department aims to progress and pass to me for decision as quickly as possible after completion of the necessary consultation and assessment procedures. The rigorous assessment of all licence applications is fair to all concerned and is designed to ensure that only sustainable projects proceed. Applications for major <Col N="1105" /> expansion of marine finfish farms must be accompanied by a comprehensive environmental impact statement for consideration by the public and specialist organisations. Inevitably, larger marine aquaculture developments will only be feasible further off-shore. The more complex or controversial the application, the longer it takes to process. In straightforward new cases, usually small in nature, a decision is made within three to four months, and sometimes earlier if no objections or concerns emerge during the necessary consultation process.</P>
    <P>My Department and I, in consultation with the aquaculture industry, are keeping the licensing procedures under close review to ensure that good practices will continue to prevail both in the preparation and processing of licence applications and necessary supporting documentation. A suite of detailed monitoring and other protocols for matters such as water quality and benthic monitoring and amelioration, audit of farms, sea lice monitoring and control and fallowing of sites has already been devised for the marine finfish sector in consultation with the industry and other interested parties and made part-and-parcel of aquaculture licences.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding on devising further protocols for both the marine finfish and marine shellfish sectors, with priority for visual impact assessment and lighting and marking of structures.</P>
    <P>The industry and my Department intend to address priority licensing issues concerning freshwater aquaculture later this year in consultation with other permitting authorities in order to streamline the permitting and monitoring procedures and to allow the sector to develop to its full potential in a sustainable way.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of licence conditions and action against illegal operations will be intensified in order to ensure proper standards of aquaculture operations generally and close off potential sources of complaints for other operators or the public generally. Full industry co-operation and good practices will, of course, enhance the public acceptability of aquaculture operations and pave the way for the continued growth of the sector.</P>
    <P>The provision of an independent statutory appeals mechanism, as well as a mechanism for public consultation and consultation with specialist organisations, is a key feature of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. It is essential that the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board performs its duties efficiently and effectively and has the necessary powers to do so.</P>
    <P>The board has dealt with a substantial caseload since it was established on 30 June 1998, with 62 cases already determined. In two cases, the board did not uphold the ministerial decision to license. Only two of the 13 ministerial decisions to refuse to grant a licence for shellfish operations were appealed to the board which upheld the refusal in one case and has yet to determine the appeal in the other case, as well as appeals against five ministerial decisions to license marine finfish operations. I commend the board for its vital <Col N="1106" /> work. In all, 68 out of 404 ministerial decisions have been appealed under the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>The board has pointed to the lack of any power or obligation in the 1997 Act for its refusal to explain determinations made, in contrast to the specific statutory obligation on An Bord Pleanála under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts. This has created obvious difficulty for licence applicants and for me as Minister with responsibility for national policy on aquaculture licensing and so calls for early remedy via the Bill. It is only proper, in the interests of transparency and fairness of procedures, that all future determinations of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board shall be explained when made, and that the board shall, on request, give a summary of the main reasons and considerations for past determinations. That is the purpose of section 2 of the Bill which inserts a new subsection (8) in section 40 of the 1997 Act dealing with appeals to the board. Only minimal additional work for the board is expected from those necessary provisions.</P>
    <P>The other priority matter concerns inspection powers. The Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board requested a clearer statutory statement of its own power, and the power of any consultant or adviser engaged by it, to visit any land or foreshore or area or water to which an appeal relates, whether or not an oral hearing of the appeal is to be held. There is doubt that the current inspection power may be limited to appeal cases where an oral hearing is held, which was not the intention. I am delighted to be able to accede to the board's request in a timely way via section 4 of the Bill which provides comprehensive inspection powers for the board and for any consultant or adviser engaged to perform functions on behalf of the board. A number of consequential amendments to the 1997 Act are provided for in sections 3 and 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>More importantly, since the Bill was passed by Seanad Éireann on 20 June 2000, the Attorney General has confirmed that the 1997 Act, as worded, precludes the board from recruiting its own staff directly. The volume of board business was not anticipated when the 1997 Act was being prepared and is such, and likely to be such, as to require flexible staff recruitment arrangements which my Department is unable to provide by the expedient of temporary assignment of staff. I will, therefore, be proposing amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, modelled on the staffing provisions for An Bord Pleanála in sections 120, 121, 122 and 123 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I will be taking the opportunity to propose additional amendments so as to copperfasten long-standing arrangements for the renewal, consolidation and assignment of licences for aquaculture purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill requires amendment to take account of the enactment of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 2000, and delay in enactment of the present Bill until this year. The text of the <Col N="1107" /> proposed amendments will be circulated as soon as possible after the Second Stage is completed.</P>
    <P>In relation to sustainable aquaculture development, the aquaculture licensing framework in place and the important provisions of the Bill before this House are an essential element of our strategy to develop aquaculture as a high quality and high value contributor to local and national development as soon as possible. My vision is of Ireland being the premier producer of top quality aquaculture products for the European and global markets.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the further sustainable development of aquaculture and has earmarked £25 million in the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006, for aquaculture, which is more than double the funding made available under the last round of Structural Funds. Details of the investment scheme for aquaculture were deposited in the Oireachtas Library last month. More than a doubling of annual aquaculture production is projected in that period, that is, to over 95,000 tonnes, as compared with 44,000 tonnes currently.</P>
    <P>A strong partnership between my Department, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute and Udarás na Gaeltachta, the industry and myself will ensure that we achieve our objectives for the aquaculture sector and position the industry to compete successfully in growing international markets. Even more innovation and sustained efforts will be required also in the longer term so that aquaculture can reach its potential as a provider of significant income and jobs in remote rural areas such as coastal areas.</P>
    <P>The CIRCA report, which we commissioned in 1999 and published in June last year, provides a major strategic analysis of the future directions and opportunities for aquaculture. The report concludes that sustainable development of our aquaculture industry is in the national interest and vital for the well-being and future of our coastal communities, as Deputies like me representing those communities will verify. The report recommends that the industry must achieve critical mass in production terms, diversification into new species, best practice in line with stringent environmental guidelines and high standards of quality assurance. These are the key challenges to address in order to position the industry internationally over the next decade, and allow it to develop and prosper thereafter.</P>
    <P>The report recommends the achievement of an annual production of at least 150,000 tonnes by 2015 in order to underpin at least some 9,000 jobs and annual income of at least £450 million by adopting the following four strategies: quickly build critical mass in salmon, sea reared trout and mussels and increase the level of value added in the production chain; create additional peripheral coastal income and high quality jobs in species with lower capital costs and less potential value added; the State must enhance its services underpinning quality, sustainable development, regu<Col N="1108" /> lation and other technical and policy areas, and there must be greater support for innovation-led development, which ensures that research and development, technology transfer and technical services will better meet the needs of the industry. The CIRCA report clearly puts a tough ambitious agenda before us all. The potential rewards in terms of significant jobs and income provision have been highlighted and are achievable.</P>
    <P>In relation to jobs, most people will know that I live on the Hook peninsula in County Wexford, which is between Bannow Bay and Waterford estuary. Both areas have extensive aquaculture, which provides full-time employment for many people living close to me. Without aquaculture, those people would have had to leave their home parish of Templetown or many of the other parishes around the country to go to the cities, or maybe to emigrate. People now live at home and work in good well-paid jobs in their own area. They are part of the community and are able to play for local hurling and football teams. I assure this House of my total commitment to work with all concerned to secure the prospects that are available as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which has already been before the Seanad. Fine Gael will support this Bill. I fully concur with the main thrust of the Bill although we may table amendments. This is a short Bill but a very important one in that it raises some fundamental questions relating to aquaculture licences, including how they are given out and how appeals against ministerial decisions to grant or refuse aquaculture licences under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, are determined.</P>
      <P>In itself the Bill might appear to be short but in my view it is very important and raises some very fundamental questions about matters relating to aquaculture licences, how they are given out and of course the whole question of how the appeals are determined against ministerial decisions to grant or refuse aquaculture licences under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. I will have a lot more to say about that shortly.</P>
      <P>This Bill also proposes to clarify the power of the board or any consultant or adviser engaged in it to inspect any land, foreshore or area of water to which the relevant appeal relates whether or not the appeal is subject to an oral hearing. I had assumed current legislation actually covered that but that must not be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things worth mentioning in this Bill is that the Government proposals for the future of the aquaculture industry are quite extensive, and I compliment the Minister on this. If the plans are to be realised, and we all hope they will, there will be far more people getting into the business and as a consequence there will have to be order in how we run and are perceived to run it. There will have to be a transparent appeals mechanism as in the case of many other Depart<Col N="1109" /> ments. The aggrieved person should have the opportunity to make oral appeals and they should also in the case of refusal of an application be told why and on what grounds their application was refused. According to the Minister 68 out of 404 ministerial decisions have been appealed.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to another aspect. As well as giving the opportunity for a transparent appeal that gives reasons for its decisions, it is very important that there should be retrospection on decisions that have been made without clarification since the introduction of the Act. It is very inappropriate that any appeal would be refused without reason being given. People go to a lot of trouble and invest a lot of time and effort with an application and they should be told why an appeal was refused. I assume the Minister, in his summing up, will give an undertaking that it will be retrospective.</P>
    <P>The whole appeals mechanism is a matter that has taken up a great deal of time in many Departments particularly over the last four or five years. The most notable case is in Social Welfare where they have a well honed system of written and oral appeals based on a decision given by the appeals officer in writing concerning the reasons an appeal was either rejected or granted. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is currently in the midst of setting up a new appeals system. This is badly needed and the Minister knows it is something farmers have been looking for for some time. It is being introduced because, while many farmers knew they could make oral or written submissions, they never understood why their particular case was not successful. That is the culture that exists and for that reason I hope this goes through and we have an open transparent system.</P>
    <P>I see also in section 2 of this Bill, paragraph (b), that there is to be a supplementary section to require the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board to provide on request a summary of the main reasons and considerations on which were based the determination of appeals before enactment of this Bill. I have no idea how many decisions are there but where people do want a report it should be made available to them quickly.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is also very important in that the insertion of the new section 57A in the Act of 1997 gives comprehensive inspection powers to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, its consultants or advisers in relation to any land to which the relevant appeal relates whether that appeal is subject to an oral hearing. If there was any doubt about that Minister it would be a grave constraint on restriction on the workings of the board if the nominated person could not actually go on site. Will the Minister give some indication why it was not possible previously?</P>
    <P>We also have the whole question of making it an offence to obstruct the board or a consultant or adviser who wishes to inspect the land. There are considerable penalties for this. I understand that there were huge arrears and delays in dealing with licence applications over the years. One <Col N="1110" /> would hope that is now being streamlined. I understand that 294 licences, comprising 272 aquaculture and 22 trial licences for aquaculture purposes, have been granted. This usually worked out at 60 or 70 in previous years. It appears that the system is working better. How many applications are now on hand in the Department? The Minister might also inform me how many applications for finfish culture are in train at the moment.</P>
    <P>When one gets down to dealing with those licences there are many aspects that have to be looked at and I understand that EIS studies are part and parcel of this. It all has to do with water quality, the ability of the sites to take the tonnage that is being applied for, etc. Sea lice monitoring and control of and the use of fallowing sites come into play here. I would like the Minister to outline how many cases actually went to the appeals board every year over the last five years. As the years go by, are there more objections and appeals because we live in an appeals culture?</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry has exciting prospects provided it is handled properly. The £25 million that was earmarked in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 certainly should see a greater number of jobs created in aquaculture. One would hope that there would be a huge increase in the annual aquaculture production between now and 2006. The CIRCA report on this subject which was published late last year certainly would give reason to believe that a major opportunity presents itself for growth in this industry.</P>
    <P>What is terribly important about this is the help it should give to the coastal communities. This is an area on which I want to reflect for a minute. In my travels up and down the coastline I notice that, given the constraints on fishing generally and certainly under the Common Fisheries Policy which will be negotiated next year, there is no reason to believe fishing is actually going to expand. Rather the opposite would be the case. From everything I read and hear it seems that the next review of the Common Fisheries Policy will show there are fewer people involved. That is why it is so important that aquaculture in the peripheral areas should be made work now.</P>
    <P>We all know that there has been a severe clampdown on fishing activities since the last meeting of Fisheries Ministers at Christmas.It is notable in many of the fishing communities that no ancillary projects have been carried out. It was mainstream fishing or nothing. One would have hoped through the CIRCA report and the investment in aquaculture that we would have witnessed the same kind of activity in the coastal villages as in inland towns as a result of the tiger economy. I am not talking about huge industry because we are realistic enough to know the infrastructure does not exist in many of those small half parishes. Through the Leader groups, county development teams and the various interests in the fishing area one would have hoped it would be possible to bring communities <Col N="1111" /> together and build this project around them because it will have to be their project. There is no way it can be imposed on them. Irrespective of what BIM or the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources says, if it does not suit a local community and if they do not have ownership of it, it will not work.</P>
    <P>One would have assumed it would be possible, through good planning, sound investment projects, training methods and retraining of the workforce, to quickly build critical mass in salmon, sea reared trout and mussels and increase the level of value added in the production chain. The whole concept of creating additional coastal income is important as is the enhancement of State services. However, frequently those services are diluted by the time they get to those areas. In the world of agriculture which includes severely handicapped areas, there is a great need for an injection into the coastal economies. There is a great need for this integration at local level.</P>
    <P>I know of a number of instances where unsuccessful applicants for licences could not understand why they were refused, particularly in the finfish area. I shall give a few general examples. I recall a particular case in the northern end of the country which goes back to 1988 or 1989. In this case a designated line was drawn in the bay with a certain limited tonnage. However, as the years went by it appeared that some people could breach that line and the tonnage has dramatically increased. The person who was refused a licence would want to know the reason those things happened. In another case where licences were granted to all the applicants on one occasion but because of an appeal by the other applicants against a particular person who had already got the licence, the case went to the appeals board. It appears after a long drawn-out procedure the objectors' appeal was upheld. The strange thing about this case is that the applicant was never given the reason the Minister decided to grant him a licence. However, on appeal from the other stakeholders the appeals board decided to accept their objections. I find that difficult to understand. This applicant who worked on a temporary licence was extremely successful but his business was terminated.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the appeals section and the necessity to ensure the appeals system is transparent and that reasons are given for either the refusal or granting of a licence. It reminds me of a motorist who takes his car for the NCT and is told the car did not pass the test but is not given the reason. That would not work. That is similar to what happened in the appeals case. It sums up the theme of this legislation. It is extremely important that decisions are transparent, open and understood. When the legislation is enacted I hope the applicant will be in a position to understand the decision, in other words, that it is not in legal text which the ordinary person may not understand. Appeals will have to be published <Col N="1112" /> and the reasons will be retrospective to the time the appeals board was established.</P>
    <P>I understand there are seven members on the appeals board. I know only a few of them and they are highly respectable people and do a good job in difficult circumstances. Given that the industry is geared for greater things in the future, this is a job that not everybody would want to take up. I compliment them on the work being done. This legislation is aimed primarily at ensuring that every possible opportunity is given to the applicant whose appeal has been rejected and that he is informed of the reason. We are not casting aspersions on anybody here. That provision should have been included in the earlier legislation. I am surprised at the omission in the first place.</P>
    <P>I assume that the obligations imposed by the legislation on the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board are similar to those imposed on An Bord Pleanála. An Bord Pleanála will, on request, provide a copy of decisions, but also a full copy of the written report by the inspectors; I have seen it and it is extremely useful. I assume that will happen in the case of the appeals board.</P>
    <P>An important factor is the quality of water in many of the bays where aquaculture operations have commenced. This is a major issue for local authorities. It is obvious there is a need for huge investment for the purpose of overcoming the problem of raw sewage getting into bays and rivers. This is a matter that has been debated here since I became a Member. It is only in recent years, since we have had access to European funding, that we are in a position to do something about it. Irrespective of what legislation is on the Statute Book, and if the water quality, which is the driving force behind any new proposals in the aquaculture industry, is not right, nothing can be done about it.</P>
    <P>For the future development of aquaculture it is important to have a co-ordinated approach between BIM, the Marine Institute and Údarás na Gaeltachta. If ever the concept of organised rural communities came into play, it would be in this area. I am always wary of putting things on a statutory footing as it usually does not work. There should be various initiatives and financial inducements to small coastal communities to do this work. Given the commitment shown by the Government to this sector in the next five or six years, I hope many new jobs will be created in remote coastal areas in which industrialists are not interested. This is the problem for small coastal communities which must make a few pounds from fishing and farming. The land is these areas is generally poor and off-farm employment is not readily available.</P>
    <P>It is important that we shorten the length of time allowed for licensing decisions. There is a two-month period for decisions on planning applications to local authorities. However, this does not always apply because if further information is sought on the last day of the original two-month period, one is into a second two-<Col N="1113" /> month period. Is it possible to introduce a statutory limit on the time allowed so people know that if they supply the relevant information a decision will be taken by a certain date? I commend the Bill and look forward to discussing it further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have much to say on this short but important Bill. I said most of what I wished to say on this issue during debate on the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, and the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Act, 1998. This Bill closes gaps in those two Acts which we forcibly pointed out at the time.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to amendments he would table on Committee Stage. Will he ensure that we receive those amendments in good time? On previous legislation we dealt with amendments on Committee Stage which we received at the start of committee's proceedings. I remind the Minister of State that, on that occasion, I asked that such things should not happen again.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Bill will deal with staffing arrangements as it seems ludicrous to place legislation on the Statute Book without providing the necessary finance and personnel to implement its provisions. At one stage, the Minister indicated that funding and staffing would be reviewed before the end of 2000. Has this been done and, if so, what are the results? The appeals board was concerned about this issue.</P>
      <P>The Bill rightly draws a parallel between the appeals board and An Bord Pleanála which will be generally welcomed. However, one important aspect regarding An Bord Pleanála is the revised rules which place a time limit on appeals. There was a backlog of a couple of hundred licence applications which had not been dealt with and many people were operating without licences. Are people still operating without licences as many were doing so on the last occasion we discussed this issue? A serious effort was made to reduce the number of people operating without licences and to increase the number of licences granted. What is the current situation? There was no reference to this issue in the Minister of State's speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's speech did not refer to the effect this industry is having on wild salmon and wild trout. There is another element to this issue. There is a good combination in the Department in that the Minister, Deputy Fahey, is from the west coast and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is from the east coast. However, the main effects of this Bill will be felt in the west which experiences most difficulties regarding wild salmon and trout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of campaigns organised by anglers and organisations in the west and south concerning the contamination of wild salmon and trout and the damage being caused. It <Col N="1114" /> has been scientifically established that the problem is caused by traps and their locations, particularly in estuaries.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not include provisions regarding the contamination of shellfish. Perhaps this issue could be dealt with by regulations under the Bill. Shellfish are harvested on many rivers and estuaries which are contaminated by sewage. Substantial work has been carried out on a number of rivers on which shellfish are being farmed, particularly with regard to domestic sewage. I do not know of the Department's intentions in this regard but if we are to spend £25 million developing the industry we will have to examine the contamination of shellfish in particular by domestic and industrial sewage.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports this Bill. However, I am more interested in the amendments which will facilitate a more in-depth consideration of this important legislation. I ask the Minister of State to take on board the points I have raised and to refer to them in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this technical legislation. As a backbencher I put pressure on the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to address some of the concerns brought to my attention in the context of the determination of the appeals by the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the efficient manner in which they dealt with these concerns. As a result people will now have confidence in ALAB's decisions.</P>
      <P>I thank ALAB for its work. It had a difficult job to perform and, on occasions, its personnel had to travel extensively to familiarise themselves with concerns brought to their attention by applicants for licences or those with concerns regarding the issuing of such licences by the Department. The Minister of State has highlighted that, over the past two years in particular, since the introduction of the legislation in 1997, the board has dealt with 68 cases brought to its attention while six remain to be determined. The legislation will underpin the transparent licensing provision which was provided for in the 1997 Act. The further refinement of the 1997 legislation will allay some of the concerns that have been brought to our attention. This is a new venture, and one we all welcome, which is giving independent effect to a decision that can have a huge effect on a community. It will add to the fairness involved for everyone concerned, including applicants, the public at large and statutory bodies involved in aquaculture. They will be completely satisfied that their applications have been dealt with as fairly and transparently as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell adverted to a backlog of licence applications. In time, the Department will be in a position to make decisions on applications currently before it and there will be an opportunity to appeal, if necessary. Over the past two years, the ALAB has been very fair and transparent in <Col N="1115" /> its operations. The legislation will add to that transparency by allowing people to become familiar with the board's decisions. It will also allow the public, who may have opposed a development, or an applicant, whose appeal has been refused, to see where they have gone wrong. It will be helpful to the Department which will be able to fine tune what it has done where an appeal has not been successful.</P>
    <P>I thank the departmental officials who have had to deal with quite a difficult job in a new industry which has had its ups and downs. We had, and to a certain extent still have, unlicensed operators, which is a situation that we wish to address as quickly as possible. I commend the Department for dealing as efficiently and effectively as possible with 404 applications in the past two years.</P>
    <P>The application process can sometimes take time but, through the provision of EIS and public consultation, we have brought the industry beyond the fledgling stage it was at some years ago. At that time, people were afraid of the possible consequences of future development, but we are now in a position to fine tune the industry. Concerns remain and we have to achieve a balance between the industry's aims and those of tourism which are important for scenic areas, particularly in coastal communities such as the one I represent. I have a good working relationship with the industry in my own area of Inver Bay where we saw an opportunity for many fishermen to move from traditional inshore fishing, which had no future prospects, to aquaculture. I agree with Deputy Connaughton that there must be joint ownership of these developments by fishermen and the community. People will always be afraid of others coming to work in a close-knit coastal community. What was achieved in my locality, however, has worked very well. Local people were involved and as a consequence we have had total support for the development of the industry, because the tradition was there.</P>
    <P>There are still opportunities in coastal communities, in small isolated areas in particular, to allow for increased production in the aquaculture sector, to which the Minister adverted. We are not just talking about finfish farming, but also about the entire spectrum of aquaculture, including the fish-farming of salmon, trout and shellfish. I am delighted to see that more and more people are interested in eating shellfish, which is a popular dish in restaurants and whose overseas sales, particularly to the French and other continental markets, have a huge impact on the viability of coastal communities.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for the tremendous work they have done with the problem of Biotoxins, and for introducing the compensation scheme for some fish farmers who found themselves in serious difficulties. It is acknowledged that the Department needs to deal with that problem. I thank the Minister for the work he has done in trying to sustain something <Col N="1116" /> that is beyond the realm of those directly involved in the industry. Those efforts were very welcome and I thank both the Minister and the Department for their support for the industry, in particular in my constituency in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil mé anois mar Aire Stát na Gaeltachta tá tionchar mór ar an bhfeirmeoireacht éisc sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Roinn. Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ag plé leis an tionscal an-tábhachtach seo fosta. Cuidíonn an tionscal go mór leis na háiteanna iargúlta atá againn, áiteanna in a bhfuil sé deacair tionscail eile a chur ar fáil ionntu. Ní amháin go gcuidíonn sé le muintir na háite agus le saol an phobail ach leis an teanga fosta. Tá suim an-mhór ag an Údarás agus ag comhlachtaí an Údaráis leis an tionscal úr seo. Cuireann an tÚdarás fáilte fosta roimh an Bille. Oibríonn an tÚdarás, Bord Iascaigh Mhara agus Roinn na Mara le chéile.</P>
    <P>Ceanglaíonn an tionscal teicneoilíocht nua-aimseartha leis an traidisiún atá sna Gaeltachtaí beaga. Tá sé an-nádúrtha fosta do na ceantair sin, mar shampla tá comhlacht amháin i gCill Chiaráin, ag díol bradán ar fud na tíre agus tá siad ag íoc £55m. Tá an fhorbairt sin ag dul ar aghaidh agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé níos fearr ná comhlacht ar bith eile a bhfuil baint aige le feirmeoireacht éisc agus le sliogéisc. Tá sé cosúil le co-op ach is comhlacht príobháideach é.</P>
    <P>Leis an tionscal seo tá tú ag caint faoi fhostaíocht sa bhreis a chur ar fáil do cheantair Ghaeltachta. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go bhfuilimid ábalta níos mó béime a chur sa tionscal anois agus dul ar aghaidh le margaíocht sa bhFrainc nó sa tSeapáin. Tá an t-airgead le fáil &ndash; £25m anois &ndash; faoin NDP agus cuideoidh sin go mór le pobal na Gaeltachta in áiteanna iargúlta. Seo tionscal an-tábhachtach dúinn sa Ghaeltacht. Tá sé in am dúinn, agus tá seo luaite sa Bhille seo, go mbeadh struchtúr neamhspleách ann anois.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan is preparing notes for his contribution and I will be obliged to listen to what he has to say because he enjoys huge support from members of the fishing industry in the Gaeltacht area in his constituency. As already stated, this industry has huge potential in Gaeltacht areas and the value added aspect is extremely important.</P>
    <P>One must be politically correct when making certain remarks. In the past one could state that women did the cooking but I do not know if any women or men have time to cook nowadays. Families cannot spend hours preparing food, particularly fish, and providing a meal. They want to have access to a product they can place in the microwave and prepare almost instantaneously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal Catch is a prime example of what can be done when a product, which only takes 20 minutes to cook, is marketed properly. Products from fish farms could also be marketed in this way. In that context, proper <Col N="1117" /> research and development, marketing methods and co-operation are vital.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with the fishing industry is that products are not marketed properly in many areas. For example, everyone in Killybegs markets their products separately. In my opinion, those involved in the industry in the town should market their products under the banner of, for example, &ldquo;Killybegs Catch&rdquo;. The aquaculture industry should follow the example of the beef, lamb and other meat production industries in using marketing tools to sell their products. There is strength to be gained from working together. Everyone is aware of the way companies in Bantry have used the name of the area to promote the mussels caught there. In my opinion, this enhances the value added aspects of the areas in which people live and work.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State indicated, there is an absolute necessity to promote best practice because this will add to the sustainability of the industry and enhance support for it. Development should take place on a managed basis and people's concerns must be addressed. Those on both sides of the fence with regard to fish farming must be reasonable. The sustainability of peripheral areas in particular must be taken into account when considering what is best practice for such areas.</P>
      <P>I accept that those involved in the industry work hard. I have seen fishermen going to work on fish farms on days when one would not put a hen out and taking risks to ensure that cages are secure and that the fish are looked after. I commend those involved in the industry, the majority of whom are young people, which creates additional employment in isolated areas to which it is difficult to attract other industries. Aquaculture products are difficult to market and we need to put in place a comprehensive marketing strategy in order to support this fledgling industry.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for introducing this legislation which will copperfasten what he intends to do in the context of developing the aquaculture industry and will add openness and transparency to the procedures used in the licensing process. It will also support the work being done by his Department and the ALAB, in particular. I am glad the clarification sought by the ALAB, regarding visits to sites in respect of which applications will be made, is dealt with in the legislation and I welcome the provision to make available to it additional supports and staff.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana, molaim an Bille atá os ár gcomhair agus tá súil agam go gcuideoidh sé go mór leis an tionscal úr an-tábhachtach atá againn, ní amháin i mo cheantar féin ach i ngach Gaeltacht eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill because we have arrived at a stage where the putting in place of an appeals mechanism appears to be more important than the initial application process. An application cannot be made in this country without it being automatically assumed that <Col N="1118" /> an appeal, or a series thereof, will be lodged. The test of any legislation is the practical effectiveness of how it operates.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, which contained a number of fundamentally correct points. The board has dealt with a number of applications on appeal and made some decisions. In doing so, it has gained necessary experience because the difficulties that arose in respect of the initial appeals with which it dealt will invariably crop up on later appeals.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also indicated that it is his ambition, as a point of principle, to have an aquaculture industry which will produce the finest foodstuffs in the world. I strongly support that assertion. As a maritime nation, Ireland has been slow to reach the kind of standards to which it should aspire. In a peculiar way, the devastation being wreaked on our economy by the foot and mouth outbreak is an indication of both the strength and fragility of an economy and an industry. As an island nation, we have a unique advantage in that we can set down world class standards and develop a reputation for finest quality and best value added products. When I served as Minister for Tourism and Trade I visited a number of countries with warmer climates than Ireland's where farmers operated small, individual aquaculture units. The standards which obtained at some of the locations I visited sometimes left a great deal to be desired and the products which emanated from them might not have matched the quality of those we are discussing here.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture industry has emerged from a difficult period which lasted 20 years. Everyone recalls the public meetings that were held, the scares about the use of Nuvan, the rows about sea lice and the disappearance of set trout and the escape from cages of reared and farmed salmon as opposed to wild salmon. To a great extent, the industry has developed and fought back against that negative image and those involved in it have learned lessons about the need for clarity and understanding and the necessity of putting people's fears at rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to water quality, cleanliness, best practice and professional standards. Yesterday we received news that President Bush has given the two fingers to the Kyoto Agreement, which dealt with greenhouse gases and atmospheric pollution. We are discussing an appeals system for the aquaculture industry. The latter can only develop in the absence of pollution and is dependent on clean water, hygienic standards, etc. The money included in the national development plan for this development is important but the costings that were put in place for that plan have altered radically because of cost increases, etc. I do not know the element of cost increase in the national development plan in so far as aquaculture developments are concerned but the Minister's Department, along with others, and the Government as a unit would do <Col N="1119" /> well to examine the development of the national plan across all fronts. We all support it, by and large, as a means of developing the community and our people but it is being implemented in an amateurish fashion. It requires a public private partnership between the Government and all its Departments and a consultancy or implementing group &ndash; of whom there are a number in Ireland &ndash; of world class standard who have set about implementing on time and on budget development plans in other cities and countries of major proportions.</P>
    <P>People on the street have little understanding of the intricacies of the aquaculture developments that are planned around the coastline or in freshwater facilities and the Minister's Department should go on a marketing offensive to explain to people the value of these developments in terms of career options and the way the product can add to both a local and an individual economy. That would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, spoke about the Gaeltacht areas and the fact that the Bill deals mainly with the west of Ireland and the Atlantic. That is true, but we have developments on land and offshore. Take the example of planning applications in, say, the west coast of north Mayo, which come before the appeals board. If one drives beyond Belmullet and towards Faulmore, and stands over the village of Glosh looking west to America and south to the black cliffs of Achill, one can see a community that is dying. There is a village where one-third of the houses are empty. We are sending out calls to emigrants to come back to Éireann to play their part in the Celtic tiger, yet those who want to come back from America or from England, who are natives of the area, cannot get planning permission to build houses for their wives and families. An appeals board such as this, however, can decide on an aquaculture development offshore which is a commercial interest with its own way of either adding or subtracting to the view, whichever opinion one accepts.</P>
    <P>This type of development should be complementary to the quality of life and the economic success of a community. There is little point in an aquaculture appeals board granting an application on appeal in a community where the people on the shore are being deprived of the opportunity to live there and play their part in that community. This development should be complementary to the kind of overall development we all want, including the Minister of State, namely, communities which are alive and which have diverse activities to generate some economic development in their areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of An Bord Pleanála, an applicant applies for a development. Objectors appeal to the local authority. The local authority refuses the application on the basis of the objections. That file is then obsolete. The applicant then appeals to An Bord Pleanála. An Bord Pleanála can grant that application on appeal without reference to <Col N="1120" /> the original objectors, and if they are not vigilant in checking whether an appeal has been lodged, the application to which they originally objected can be granted over their heads. There is no statutory requirement on An Bord Pleanála or on the local authorities to notify anybody about that and in this instance it might be worthwhile if the appeal body were to place a notice in the local papers or inform the local radio station, for instance, to the effect that an appeal had been lodged in respect of a particular application. If that were done everybody would know about it. As time passes and the digital communications era comes more into its own, this kind of development should be discussed on local television and radio so that everybody understands that what is intended to be put in here is a world class facility, part of the world class standards to which we should aspire in everything we do as an island nation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State goes into a restaurant, as I am sure she does in her capacity as Minister for the Marine, on most occasions the restaurateur, waiter or waitress will not know whether the salmon being offered on the menu is farmed or wild. Very few people can tell the difference. As a native of a western county who has long experience of this, it is possible to know from natural or acquired taste whether it is farmed or wild salmon but the industry has developed to the point where the colouring, quality, size and taste of the farmed salmon cannot be differentiated by most people. A man in a restaurant with a plate of mussels or cockles in front of him usually has little understanding of the investment, care, attention and diligence that it takes to produce that dish as a quality product.</P>
    <P>It is essential, in terms of the national development plan, that our adherence to European directives on water pollution, etc. has to be rigorously enforced and advanced to a point where we can be justifiably proud of the standards here. At the moment they are deplorable in many cases. Raw sewage flowing into lakes, rivers and streams at a time when the Minister of State is doing her best to put in place a world class facility for shellfish and aquaculture is unacceptable. Entire sewerage systems are flowing into nearby waters and polluting them. This industry can be strong but fragile and given the parallel attack we are now experiencing in terms of a virus in animals, red tide and other problems can wipe out an industry overnight.</P>
    <P>There remains some tension between those who are involved in the fishing of natural fish and those involved in the production of farmed fish. There was a breaking of the cage, if that is the proper term, at the back of Clare island some time ago. I do not know what studies have been done on the effect of the integration of the Atlantic salmon with escaped farmed salmon, and whether there is a diminution of the species in terms of its genetic quality, strain or whatever. These are issues that need to be discussed and <Col N="1121" /> explained to people. In that sense the Minister's Department has an important role to play.</P>
    <P>I know a number of shellfish farmers on the west coast and they are committed not only to development of their product but to marketing and selling it abroad. One would be surprised at the extent of sales coverage of west of Ireland shellfish to the markets not only in France but to many other countries, including the Middle East and the Far East. It takes a great deal of logistical management to get the lorries and trucks, with their refrigerated units, etc., through customs, particularly with a product that will perish quickly, to the French market to get the value added.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to put a notice in a local newspaper that an appeal has been received. One often finds at public meetings on the west coast that people who came to the country many years ago do not have a relationship with the area in which they live. I am not criticising them, but people do not have a right in law to a view. Most of the objections to aquaculture developments relate to their visual impact and to the fact that the bay will be destroyed. What is law in one case should apply equally in another. The Minister of State did not say whether bays in certain localities have been deemed suitable for aquaculture development and that such development will take place, subject to conditions, such as licensing, visual impact, water quality, tonnage capacity etc.</P>
    <P>I would like to think we would pump more money into research and development as a result of applications for aquaculture development. I do not know where we stand in terms of world research on the future of aquaculture. The store of man's knowledge almost doubles every five years. I am sure there is ongoing intensive research into the possibilities and potential for aquaculture in the future. I do not know what links the Minister of State has with the Marine Institute, the universities and the institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>After the devastation wreaked on the economy by the foot and mouth crisis, perhaps we could adopt a resolution which states we are proud of what we produce from the sea and from aquaculture developments, whether in the sea or in fresh water. We should send a message to every country in Europe and beyond that our standards are world class and that everyone involved in the business can be trusted. We must ensure that cowboys are not allowed in the industry and that the developments granted under licence prove themselves and are tested on their merit. If we set standards over the next five, ten, 15 or 20 years and rigorously implement them, it will pay off in the longer term. People abroad are becoming more conscious of quality, standards and hygiene. Aquaculture has an important part to play and the Minister of State can take the lead by not taking any prisoners when setting standards. If he does not believe it is right, it should not happen. This business is too sensitive and <Col N="1122" /> important to allow cowboys into it. We have seen parallel disasters in recent days.</P>
    <P>There are 13 wild brown trout fisheries left in the great lakes in the west and the tributaries which run into the sea. Perhaps when the Minister of State is summing up on Second Stage he will refer to the projections for the native Atlantic salmon stocks and outline what is happening with sea trout. I often receive bulletins from those involved in the sea trout industry. These two things have proven to be complementary.</P>
    <P>This board is an important economic entity. There should be discussions and open days so that young people can become involved in a tough but worthwhile career and play their part in the development of the economy far from the maddening crowd in cities, such as Dublin. I wish the board well. I hope lessons will be learned as it continues to make decisions on appeals. Anyone wanting to apply for an aquaculture licence should clearly understand that when the application is lodged, it will be dealt with rigidly and that it should better measure up to the highest standards set down for this development. This means that when the appeals board makes a decision, it will do so in accordance with those standards and it will not be afraid to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members of the House, I welcome the Bill which tries to regulate the appeals system. It also gives us an opportunity to express our views on the future of the aquaculture business. We are talking not only about the sea based aquaculture business but also about the land based business. Fresh water aquaculture could become as big a player as sea aquaculture. Recently I saw a television programme which outlined the value of producing fresh water fish in fish farms on the Continent and in other parts of the world. We have the resources to capitalise on this growing market. We are all aware that pike, which is a humble fish here, is a delicacy in Germany and commands a higher price than salmon. We are not making the most of the available opportunities. We also know that Irish eels are extremely valuable. Some individuals are considering becoming involved in commercial eel farming.</P>
      <P>We talk about rural development. Many people think that rural development can only take place in the agriculture or industrial sectors. However, aquaculture can have a major input in rural development. We are all aware that aquaculture has been the lifeline of many coastal communities over the years. Shellfish farming has proved successful and has been a source of income and employment in areas where industrial development was not possible and did not make commercial sense. We must look at this in the context of the overall development of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members spoke about the effects on communities of people objecting to developments. We have seen An Bord Pleanála, which is responsible for housing and other developments on land, take decisions which did not <Col N="1123" /> meet the wishes of the majority of the people in an area. We have also seen cases where people, who had little or no contact with an area, lodged planning appeals on spurious grounds and were successful. There was a case recently in my constituency where people who had recently moved into the area objected to a development and, as a result of a decision by An Bord Pleanála which went against the wishes of 99.9% of the community, 15 people lost their jobs. I hope the same does not happen in the fisheries area. We hope the process is transparent so that those who object must state whether they have a vested interest and their detailed reasons for objecting. We all know there are people who are good at putting together long-winded documents which do not address the facts and these documents are often used in appeals. Those involved in the fisheries appeals system must give full details of their vested interests and whether they feel their community will benefit or lose out as a result of the developments.</P>
    <P>We have all seen that fish farming and fish cages can be unsightly. As Deputy Kenny said, however, looking at villages deserted because of lack of employment is much more undesirable. There must be a proper assessment of proposed developments to see if they will be of benefit to the community and the economy. The effects of pollution are seen in my own constituency. A number of fish farms in the Sligo area were closed down because of the problem of red tide. The compensation offered will not be sufficient to bring those people back into production quickly. They need to recover their investment and they are dependent on pollution being cleared up.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the feed used in fish farming conforms to regulations. We have seen the problems that exist now in the livestock industry. These problems, such as BSE, were caused by feed. I hope the controls to be put in place regarding feed, unlike the use of meat and bonemeal as feed for bovines, will be sufficient to ensure that there is no danger of pollution or infection. There is need for major research into the use of foodstuffs and the effect this feed may have, not only on the farmed fish, but on wild fish. Our sea trout stocks are disappearing at the moment due perhaps to sea lice. The use of chemicals in fish farming must be properly assessed. Fish farm operators may have licences but they must be subject to proper controls. The use of controls is just as important in fish farming as in other areas of agriculture. If operators decide to break the law or take actions that are not in the best interests of the industry, they should be aware that they will be closed down. That is the only way to make this industry grow. The opportunities for the expansion of aquaculture are endless. We have the necessary coastal areas and the inland freshwater hatcheries used by the salmon industry have been quite well managed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> If we are to see a doubling of its potential over the coming years, as suggested in the Minister's speech, it will be necessary to have proper controls, investment and infrastructure. A proper processing industry working as a complement would avoid people being led into a market cul-de-sac and is equally important. Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be involved as a marketing umbrella for the entire fishing industry. Deputy Coughlan referred to the fact that all the processors in Killybegs and around the country are competing against each other for market share. This is not in the best interest of themselves or those who produce the raw material. A marketing umbrella body to take control of the entire fishing industry is essential.</P>
    <P>In the beef industry, for example, Irish companies were competing against each other in foreign markets, so instead of the price being maintained, it became depressed. That does not help farming practice. If an operator is not achieving an economic production price for his product, then he cannot stay in business.</P>
    <P>If fish farmers get sufficient reward for their labours, they will not have to resort to undesirable practices. I ask the Minister to tell the House what type of supervision will be implemented for the continual monitoring of licence holders. That is a very important provision. There should be random inspection without notice and the inspectors should be rotated. We all know that familiarity breeds contempt, and we know that this has caused problems in the livestock industry and they have been highlighted by the foot and mouth scare. I hope this will not happen in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear how the Minister and his Department plan to develop the freshwater fishing industry. That is an industry which we can capitalise on. It produces a product in high demand as shown by the price of salmon compared with the lowly pike. It has probably been one of the causes of the problem experienced in the west where, down the years, unscrupulous European anglers fill camper vans with pike which they have netted illegally. Nobody is taking action to stop them. Fisheries officers often do not arrive in time to catch these poachers and they are back in Hamburg or Munich before anyone can stop them. We must guard against people coming to this country and plundering our fisheries and waters, to the detriment of the genuine angling industry. Poaching and pollution are affecting stocks in many of our rivers, especially in the north-west and the Border counties. Poaching has contributed more to the problem than has pollution.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the industry is properly controlled and monitored. Local people must have a proper input with regards to their own rights and to development. Outsiders with vested interests, many of them non-nationals and with all due respects to them, are objecting to proposals for development because their view of the bay might be affected for the one week that they spend in the locality. They are not taking into account the local people who need a source of income for 52 weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> Earlier this year, I was annoyed. The first salmon of this year was caught in the Drowes river. The local angling club asked RTE to cover the tagging of the fish at the river. RTE was not in a position to send a camera crew, but UTV came down and broadcast the event on its news bulletin the following day. The media have a part to play. Most of the programmes on television dealing with fish farming have shown the industry in a negative light. The bias was very clear in some cases and the local community were denied the opportunity that was needed. I hope this Bill will result in the creation of a transparent appeals system.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure quality production mechanisms and processes are prioritised in the implementation of aquaculture supervision. Our aquaculture products should command top prices in the market and that can only be achieved through quality processes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this timely legislation which proves he has the interests of the aquaculture industry at heart. Aquaculture is very well suited to the Irish coastline. The industry already provides more than 3,000 jobs and generates £67 million annually, a figure which is only the tip of the iceberg. If this industry is properly managed, it will go from strength to strength and could employ up to 6,000 people in the next five years.</P>
      <P>In the absence of proper supervision, the aquaculture industry could have been crippled in its infancy. The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, albeit a short Bill comprising six sections, provides for the fundamental aspects of the industry's future development. However, we should not delude ourselves and become over-enthusiastic. It is most important that the industry is put on a level keel and receives the required Exchequer backing to ensure it will play a dominant role in our economy in the future.</P>
      <P>Since coming into this House, I have always expressed the view that aquaculture had vast potential. Coming from the maritime constituency of Cork South-West, I have seen the changes effected in that area by the mariculture industry. Bantry Bay boasts one of the finest mussel industries in the world. The Minister recently opened a new factory which has breathed new life into an area which was withering away. I am well aware of the difference the fishing and aquaculture industries can make to the livelihoods of people living around the coastline from the south-west to Donegal and the Minister of State's constituency in Wexford. The latter area has played its part in the development of the industry.</P>
      <P>Shellfish and salmon farming are the primary elements of the industry at present but I believe there is an opening for other types of fish farming such as turbot or cod farming. Perhaps the Minister would investigate the possibility of widening the scope of fish farming throughout the country. Rural Ireland cannot survive if its natural resources are not developed. People there cannot live on fresh air and water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overstocking can be as damaging in the aquaculture industry as it can in agriculture. We are <Col N="1126" /> well aware of the consequences of putting 20 cows out to pasture on grass intended for only ten. The same applies to overstocking our waters. The Minister and the appeals board must ensure that no over-stocking occurs in any bay in which there is an aquaculture industry. We are a greedy race and could risk killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to objections from people who do not have an interest in this industry. Such people have a right to object but this legislation should allay their fears. The proper planning of the aquaculture industry can go hand in hand with other development.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that larger marine aquaculture development will only be feasible further off-shore and I concur with that view. Huge salmon farming developments must be moved away from estuaries and bays into deep water. Sea trout fishermen have stated that sea lice are primarily responsible for the decimation of sea trout stocks and the Minister must bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>On 7 January, BBC 2 aired a documentary entitled &ldquo;Warnings from the Wild&rdquo;. The programme portrayed in no uncertain fashion the serious situation in some parts of Scotland and Norway because of overstocking of aquacultural development. The Norwegians were open about it. The Secretary General of the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries readily admitted that it was known that sea lice from farms were responsible for killing wild salmon smolts. This has been proved to happen.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the decimation of wild salmon stocks by illegal fishing. However, I speak for the half-decker salmon fishermen who try to make a living for their wives and families by fishing salmon, which is a natural way to make a livelihood. These people are bedevilled with regulations and are debarred from making an income from an occupation which their forefathers operated. Statistics prove salmon fishermen are not responsible for the decimation of wild salmon stocks, rather it is the intermingling of wild salmon with farmed salmon. I am not happy with the situation regarding sea lice which can be transmitted from farmed salmon to wild salmon.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Kenny say that, if a person orders salmon in a hotel, the waiter will not be able to say whether it is wild or farmed salmon. All meat must be sourced nowadays and the same should apply to fish in restaurants. They should be able to prove to customers whether their salmon is wild or farmed. That is very important for the survival of the industry.</P>
    <P>It is evident all is not well in the fish farming industry. I have seen Bantry Bay, which is in my area of south-west Cork, closed for a considerable period during the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. It has only recently been opened for mussel production. The bay was bedevilled with a red tide substance. Will the Minister investigate this fully and involve all sections of his Department to ascertain the cause of this red tide phenomenon which appears in the <Col N="1127" /> waters off the south-west coast? It happened recently and has happened often during the past few years. I do not know if it is as a result of over-intensive fish farming or the discharge of sewage through the main bay outlets, but it is something the Minister must investigate if he wants to preserve this industry. He will not make a success of the aquaculture industry unless he finds the root cause of this red tide phenomenon.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, sea trout stocks in Connemara have remained in a critical state and rod catches are low. Some improvements have occurred in individual fisheries, largely as a result of improved lice management. Effective management of sea lice on salmon farms remains the key to the recovery of the sea trout industry. It is of paramount importance for the Minister to understand that new strategies must be introduced. He must ensure that promoting one section of the aquaculture industry is not to the detriment of other fisheries sections on which we rely to a great extent. It is also of paramount importance that we utilise the aquaculture industry to the best of our ability. It is no good looking at depopulated areas along the western seaboard from Mizen Head to Malin Head and not looking at a body of water which could provide a huge income for those areas.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we insist that proper management control takes place in all these enterprises. I do not have any time for the cowboy developer who will not obey the Minister or comply with the policy of the Department with responsibility for fisheries. Were it not for the fact there is strict control by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the future of the aquaculture industry would be a shambles. The Minister and his Department must be very vigilant when granting licences for aquaculture development throughout the country that they do not interfere with natural fish spawning grounds. Some of those grounds have been decimated by over-production in the aquaculture industry. Each section of the industry must go hand in hand in the development of the fishing and aquaculture industries.</P>
    <P>A wide range of information is to be required under the Bill and, while giving the Minister absolute power, it also gives the appeals board in the area a relative amount of power. I am pleased to see that 250 applications for aquaculture development are on hands. The rigorous assessment of all licence applications is fair to all concerns and is designed to ensure that only sustainable projects proceed.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has in place to make payments of farm grants given that Department staff cannot carry out farm visits; if he can utilise the information he has available through CMMS to bring payments forward; if he can allow work to commence and go forward under the control of farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes provided that they can be agreed by desk discussions and where they meet planning regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): As a result of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK in February 2001, my Department cancelled on-farm inspections for all farm income support and investment schemes.</P>
    <P>If, during 2001, it is found that because of foot and mouth disease difficulties it is not possible to comply with all the requirements governing on-farm controls, then the possibilities for providing alternative assurance as to the veracity of applications under the premium schemes, which the wider use of the CMMS database in 2001 may allow, will have to be considered. My Department has already been in touch with the European Commission about the problems.</P>
    <P>With regard to farm investment schemes, it is my intention to process payments for projects completed and inspected. However, on the basis of the advice received from the expert group chaired by Professor Michael Monaghan, it is not possible to carry out any farm visits either to inspect completed works or to process new applications for on-farm investments. In this context, it is also considered inappropriate to approve works to proceed on farms which would involve the entry of contractors, builders, etc, on to the farms. I assure the Deputy that the position generally regarding payment of premium and grant aid will be kept under continual review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many farm families cannot sell store cattle or calves or get pigs to factories? Their situation in relation to income is desperate but they cannot get money that is owed to them because of minor technicalities relating to headage and area aid schemes. I urge the Minister to ensure that the logjams that exist are cleared as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding farm building and other grants, is it possible to allow new structures to be built given that on-farm visits by administrators cannot take place? These jobs are carried out by qualified contractors and the facilities can be guaranteed if qualified contractors are used. I urge the Minister to ensure that dairy hygiene and farmyard pol<Col N="1129" /> lution projects can go ahead. As he is aware, there was a 12 month delay in securing EU approval for these projects and many of them are long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the consideration Deputy Crawford, his party and the Labour Party have shown for the distress being caused to farmers in general because of the restrictions on animal movements and the various measures that have been taken since 21 February. Farmers in County Louth in particular are facing enormous difficulties, but they are making sacrifices that are in the best interests of the remainder of the country.</P>
      <P>The tradition is that store cattle are sold on. In my part of the country, there is great difficulty with regard to dropped calves while the problems regarding a number of services farmers need, particularly AI services, are becoming acute at this stage. I intend to use the CMMS, if it is appropriate, to assist with regard to payments. I have put forward a case in relation to farm buildings under the farm waste and dairy hygiene schemes to the expert group under Professor Monaghan. The expert group has allowed certain low risk activities to go ahead and I want to know how soon inspections can be carried out to allow these necessary works to commence. In relation to payments generally, I confirm that all up to date payments have been made. Any payments due in the next few weeks will be made expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many payments are still outstanding and that, according to departmental officials, farm visits are required before these can be made? However, they cannot take place. Given that these farmers will be due other payments in the future, would it be possible to make either part or full payments to them while making it clear that sums could be withheld in the future if problems emerge? Much of farmers' income now is based on premia for headage and suckler grants. There is no way they can exist without some money being made available to them now, given that they cannot sell any products. In some cases, farmers cannot even move their animals out to grass.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 2001, 383,000 cheques, with a total value of £168 million, have been issued in the post. Since the start of March, payments worth £46 million have been issued, mainly under the various premia schemes. I will ensure that any direct payments which are due will be paid. If the CMMS is likely to be helpful, it will be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put the case to the expert group in relation to capital works on farms under the dairy hygiene, farm waste and other schemes. I will base my decision on the scientific advice available to me. If the group says that certain low risk visits can take place to enable various schemes to go ahead, arrangements will be made in that regard. <Col N="1130" /> If a farmer has completed a job and only requires a visit from an agricultural inspector, arrangements will be made if the expert group says that can be allowed under certain controlled conditions.</P>

      <Quest>the level of compensation being put in place to support farmers who have been affected by the compulsory culling of their animals to curb the spread of foot and mouth disease; if steps are being taken to inform farmers with regard to the intended animal culls as a measure to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the hardship, both emotional and financial, being experienced by farmers in the vicinity of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Proleek in County Louth. The herds of farmers in the 1 km. and 3 km. zones have been compulsorily slaughtered. However, I am sure there is general consensus on all sides of the House and in the farming community and the wider public that this work, while traumatic for those involved and unpalatable for us all, is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>In each case of compulsory depopulation, my Department has arranged for valuations of the relevant animals by experts prior to slaughter so that the farmers in question can be paid the full market value for their stock. My Department will ensure that these payments are processed as quickly as possible to avoid any exacerbation of an already difficult situation for those affected. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in conjunction with my Department, has put in place arrangements to fast track assessments for eligibility under the farm assist scheme in cases of particular hardship. Compensation received for compulsory depopulation will not be taken into account in the assessment of means under the farm assist scheme.</P>
      <P>Regarding the provision of information to farmers whose herds are likely to be depopulated, I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to contact those affected as soon as possible after the decision is made in each case. Arrangements have been put in place to decide, where possible, on the following day's cull by 6 p.m. each evening and to provide the necessary information to Teagasc in the first instance to enable it to contact the farmers concerned. A list of farmers affected is also being supplied to the local IFA branch to allow farmers to check through that channel in the event that they are in any doubt about their inclusion in the following day's cull.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the prior notice given to farmers will be short, there is little alternative in the circumstances obtaining at present. I am satisfied that, however traumatic the experience will be for the farmers concerned, undue delay in giving effect <Col N="1131" /> to a decision to cull animals will only serve to exacerbate the situation and magnify any risk of transmitting the disease. I have arranged a follow-up visit by Teagasc and-or departmental officials to individual farmers whose herds or flocks have been depopulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the sense of shock and devastation experienced by farming families in the north Louth area. The core of the economy in the region is being dismantled. Does the Minister agree it is important that the compensatory procedure is implemented as a matter of urgency because many of those farmers have been without incomes for between five and six weeks? Given the compulsory disposal of stock, will the Minister agree his Department should contact the Revenue Commissioners and ask them to take cognisance of the fact that there will be artificially inflated profits on these farms for the year ending 5 April? This will not arise as a result of normal disposal but as a result of compulsory disposal initiated by the State, and rightly so. What back-up team is available? Will the Minister consider putting in place an interdepartmental task force, incorporating the multi-departmental agency approach, to provide advice, assistance and counselling? Has he been in contact with the co-ops and banks, particularly the associated banks, who have made enormous inflated profits, some of it on the backs of farmers throughout the country, requesting them, as a gesture of solidarity and goodwill with the farming and tourism community, to waive the interest chargeable on the gale days over the next three to six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have instructed the payments section of the Department to pay out the compensation to farmers who have had their herds depopulated. This will be done expeditiously. I also met the valuers concerned and my understanding is that there is market value and there has not been any difficulty in relation to valuation. While I do not have a direct line of communication to Revenue, I accept the Deputy's point that farmers who paid for depopulation, which was a <i>force majeure</i>, did not wish to do so, therefore, any profits are illusory as these stocks will have to be replaced and built up again. I will take that matter on board.</P>
      <P>On the question of a multi-departmental task force, such a task force is in place and it held its first meeting on Monday. There are very good lines of communication in place, including a help centre, which is generally organised by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The task force also involves all the other Departments and it has met in Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met the co-ops. The co-ops in the general region of Counties Louth and Monaghan have been quite helpful in relation to milk collection. They have been doing a very good job in installing filters, milk tankers and so on to allow a <Col N="1132" /> very difficult situation to be ameliorated for dairy farmers. I have not contacted the banks but there is no doubt they are doing extremely well from the Irish economy and the farming community in general. I expect they will take a benign and considered approach in this matter. I will make direct contact with the banks and take the issue up with them.  </P>

      <P>The Civil Service Commission is in the process of completing the arrangements for the appointment of the head of the new legal services division of my Department. A number of existing staff with appropriate qualifications and experience will be transferred to the new division when the head is appointed and it is envisaged that additional staff will be recruited or assigned in due course.</P>
      <P>The primary function of the legal services division will be to provide the Minister and the Department with legal advice on litigation and the development of schemes operated by the Department. The work of the legal services division will complement the legal advisory services provided by the office of the Attorney General and is being set up with the agreement of the Attorney General's office. Given the large number and the complex nature of the schemes operated by my Department, it is essential the Department has an in-house legal advisory service. Also, the Department is currently involved in more than 200 cases of litigation, including a large number of prosecutions that I have initiated. These cases cover areas such as animal health and welfare, ERAD, export refunds, intervention operations, and the rural environment protection scheme.</P>
      <P>The management services division of my Department has recently completed a review of the current functions and organisation of the former Land Commission. That report recommends that all divisions of the former Land Commission, with the exception of the inspectorate and surveyors branch, should be brought under the control of the legal services division. The divisions involved are the solicitors branch, the land services division, the records branch and the collection branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 57 staff employed in these divisions and placing all or some of these work areas under the control of the head of the legal services division would substantially broaden the remit of the unit. The management services division report on the former Land Commission will be considered by the management advisory com<Col N="1133" /> mittee of my Department shortly with a view to taking final decisions on these issues.</P>

      <P>Ten years after the demise of the Land Commission we are still at it. Can I take it that it is getting a new growth? Is one of the primary reasons for setting up the new legal services division in the Department that the AG's office cannot handle the current level of litigation cases? Will the powers of the old Land Commission be vested in the legal services division of the Minister's Department? Will the new unit take on board the fact that thousands of bog holders and landholders do not currently have full title to their farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The unit is being set up for a number of purposes. Given that the Department has a number of very complex schemes, it must draw up statutory instruments under these schemes to ensure they are legally soundly based. There is also a substantial amount of legislation in place and in the old days the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government held up legislation considerably. It considerably expedites legislation to have a great deal of the initial work done in the Department. There are more than 200 litigation cases to be dealt with by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. While the old Land Commission has been gone for more than a decade, many of the staff are still in the Department. The solicitors branch and the legal services branch of the Land Commission will now work neatly into this section and carry out much of the work outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to keep the House and the general public informed of new developments in regard to foot and mouth disease as they arise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware of the arrangements in place for culling susceptible animals in the vicinity of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Proleek, County Louth. The cull of sheep and cattle in the one kilometer zone was completed on 25 March and the cull of sheep in the three kilometer zone was completed on 26 March. The three kilometer protection zone and the ten kilometer surveillance zone provided for in European Communities legislation remain in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> The House will also be aware of the decision taken in conjunction with the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland to create a firewall between Meigh in County Armagh and Proleek in County Louth by extending the preventative cull of sheep to that area. This is intended to create a corridor in which there will be no live sheep which might be capable of transmitting the disease.  Any decision on the need for further culling in the Cooley peninsula will depend on the outcome of epidemiological and other investigations which are continuing on an ongoing basis. A decision has already been made to engage the wildlife service of Dúchas and the Army to cull any remaining susceptible wildlife on the Cooley mountains, and this work is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Further developments include acceptance by the EU's Standing Veterinary Committee of a Commission decision earlier this week to regionalise Ireland until at least 19 April when the issue will be reviewed. In effect this means the range of restrictions in place in County Louth will remain in place until that date, although the period of restriction may be extended beyond then depending on developments. Exports of agricultural products from the rest of the country can continue with appropriate certification.</P>
    <P>As for the origins of the Proleek outbreak, there has been no breakthrough to date in establishing a definitive link. The greatest risk of transmission is through animal to animal contact, followed by possible infection through people or vehicles. Investigations in relation to the origin of the Proleek outbreak are continuing and all possible leads are being followed up. In the meantime, every precaution is being taken to prevent the spread of the disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Our hearts bleed for the people of the Cooley Peninsula. It is difficult to watch what is happening from a distance. One can only imagine what the farmers of the area are going through. I guarantee the Minister the support of this side of the House in trying to ease the situation as much as possible. It is difficult to understand the reason there is still no indication of from where the outbreak came. When it was necessary to slaughter 1,200 lambs in County Monaghan I publicly supported the Department. If sheep in the Meigh area south of the Border had been slaughtered at an earlier stage, could the spread of the disease generally have been prevented? I welcome the co-operation between the Minister and his Northern counterpart, Ms Bríd Rodgers, and urge that every step be taken to confine the outbreak to the Cooley Peninsula. Will the Minister give an update on the situation in other areas? I understand there has been some good news. The House would like an update, however, on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exasperating that we have been unable to establish a link between the Meigh and Proleek cases. All the expertise suggests that ani<Col N="1135" /> mal to animal contact and vehicle and person to animal contact are the most high risk ways of transmitting the infection. I said publicly that it is callous in the extreme for people who have been involved in smuggling not to give information. It took up to last Sunday night before some of those directly involved gave us vital information. That information led to culling in five or six different parts of the jurisdiction. The sad aspect is that up to five weeks had gone by when high risk animals could have been incubating the disease and causing mayhem. One of the individuals concerned suggested on the national radio network that if he was given immunity and some payments, he would give us the necessary information. This is regrettable. Ordinary farmers and the general public have been absolutely outstanding in their national solidarity and support, as has the House. I commend everyone, including the Deputy and everyone else who supported the cull in County Monaghan. There is no doubt in my mind that sooner or later we will find that there was a connection or contact between the two outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked the up-to-date position in other areas. We are awaiting the results on the County Louth samples. It will, probably, be tomorrow morning before we receive them. We were encouraged and relieved this morning to learn that the preliminary results from Pirbright on the Camolin samples were clear. The samples from counties Laois and Waterford were also clear. The one outstanding set of results that we want from that side of the country were taken from Slaney Meats, Bunclody, yesterday evening. These samples were taken as a precautionary measure. Based on the initial clinical examination, they are not of the same high worry risk as the one in County Louth. The fact that the samples were clear is a huge relief for us because susceptible and high risk animals came into the jurisdiction before the patrols were established along the Border. They were distributed to different farms and could have been a timebomb waiting to infect a huge number of areas. Apart from the Bunclody sample, all the other samples are clear.</P>
      <P>The disease is still rampant in Britain where there are additional cases in different areas. Worryingly, the number of cases in The Netherlands has increased to ten. We have to remain on high alert in so far as the disease is concerned. We are by no means at the stage where we can relax in any way.</P>

      <P>I urge the Minister to contact the banks and look at the social welfare aspect. While the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is dealing sympathetically with those within the Cooley Peninsula, it needs to be broadened to cover those farmers who cannot sell stock. In the light of the continuing widespread infection in the United Kingdom, is the Minister satisfied with the use of mats and disinfectant at ports?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>if he has raised with his counterpart in the United Kingdom the need to ensure air and sea commuters travelling from the United Kingdom to Ireland are sufficiently encouraged to use proper disinfectant procedures at the various departure points; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The disinfection arrangements in place in ports and airports in the United Kingdom, is, in the first instance, a matter for the authorities there. Commission Decision 200/190/EC requires the United Kingdom authorities to ensure the operators of ports of exit in the United Kingdom ensure the tyres of road vehicles departing from the United Kingdom are disinfected. This is a clear EU regulation. While there is no such Commission requirement in relation to the disinfection of foot passengers aboard seagoing vessels or for air passengers, the authorities here are in continuous contact with their counterparts in the United Kingdom to seek to ensure proper disinfection arrangements are installed and maintained for both vehicles and passengers.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that adequate disinfection arrangements are in place at ports and airports. I commend the various port authorities and relevant Departments and agencies on the outstanding job they are doing. Some of the people I met at ports had come out of retirement to help staff ports and airports. They are doing an absolutely superb job in the national interest. The are ensuring banned goods or live animals from the United Kingdom are not being allowed into Ireland and that every possible precaution is being taken here to reduce the risk of transmission of foot and mouth disease from the United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that everything that can and should be done within our jurisdication is being done. There are more than 700 cases of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the number is rising by the hour. It is estimated that there will be between 4,000-5,000 cases in the United Kingdom before the disease is eradicated. Given that the disease has got out of hand in the United Kingdom and the huge volume of passenger and freight traffic between the two countries every day, like me, many people do not believe that the UK authorities are doing what they can and should do. What meetings have taken place between the Irish and British authorities and Aer Lingus, Ryanair, British Airways and ferry companies? Four out of five people believe the matter is not being taken as seriously as it should be by the other side, particularly in view of the number of cases there. It is unfortunate from the point of view of everyone <Col N="1137" /> they do not seem to be able to control the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Within this jurisdiction everything that can be done is being done. I have never experienced such a degree of national solidarity and people have been outstanding. There have been thousands of calls each day to the helpline in the Department and almost all are constructive calls. I can also confirm that in any one week there are approximately 600,000 hits on the Department's website. These are from ordinary people who want an update and want to be helpful. We know that people, of their own volition, even suspended indoor activities where there was little or no risk in order to show good example. We have a rapport with farmers in Ireland and there are few people without a close connection to the land and that is why we have such a unique response to the situation.</P>
      <P>The way other jurisdictions address the issue and their response to foot and mouth is a matter for themselves. I have been in regular contact with both Minister Nick Brown and Minister Bríd Rodgers and, to a lesser extent, with other Ministers in mainland Europe both at the Council of Ministers and by telephone. This contact seeks to ensure that countries that have a problem with foot and mouth do not transmit that disease to other countries and that they take every possible precaution. I can confirm that airports, Aer Lingus, Ryanair and the ports and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources authorities have been in direct contact with their counterparts in the UK. They have visited the UK and brought about improvements there. I have a copy of some literature now being distributed in the UK on precautions to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease to other countries.</P>

      <P>We find it incomprehensible that the authorities in the UK would encourage people to visit the countryside.

Given the suspicions we have that disinfection is not taken seriously in the UK is it not difficult for an Irish farmer to understand how that is allowed when he is not allowed to walk his cattle across the road between two parts of his farm without a permit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is a different culture in relation to the response to this disease in Britain. I want to commend both the farming and non-farming people here. People in <Col N="1138" /> shops, businesses and the tourist industry are hurting badly at the present time. Farmers are discommoded and there is a fair amount of inconvenience but for a lot of farmers business goes on, under certification, and the price of lamb and cattle is very high. The difficulty is in collecting full loads of cattle from particular places. The expert group has been asked to try to find some way to get around this problem. I accept that it is hard to understand some of the situations in Britain and other countries compared with what we are doing here. I hope our measures will stand us in good stead over the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>To facilitate research on the epidemiology of BSE in Ireland, a steering group is being established under the aegis of my Department and with the agreement of the Department of Health and Children to deal specifically with research in this area. In addition to undertaking specific research projects, the group will be responsible for collation of all data relating to the BSE eradication programme. The group will also be responsible for the upkeep of an up to date collection of scientific material in relation to BSE and will provide briefing material in relation to the same.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that this group will undertake most of the required research directly. In addition, it is envisaged that appropriate external consultants will be recruited to provide specialist advice on particular projects. In other cases, where very specialised skills are required for a discrete project, it may be more appropriate to sub-contract the entire project to a person or group.</P>
      <P>A management group will supervise all of the research, which will be responsible for commissioning, approving and auditing each research project.

In reply to a parliamentary question yesterday I was informed that it cost this country £48.5 million for BSE between 1990 and 2000. In the light of those costs would the Minister not consider it urgent to engage a consultant epidemioligist, even on a short-term basis? A question of more immediate concern is, would the Minister com<Col N="1139" /> ment on the recent report from the food safety agency in the UK in relation to the implications for Ireland and BSE? Will he ask that a consultant epidemiologist look at that report or will he comment on whether the Food Safety Authority has any view on it? </P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>BSE has been a very costly disease to Ireland and to Europe and we have lessons to learn from it. One of the weaknesses in our system was the lack of research and the lack of up to date information on the transmission of the disease. The same happens in the case of foot and mouth disease because the virus behaves in a peculiar way. The best advice and research available through the OIE in Paris and the FAO in Rome and Brussels is at our disposal and yet there is difficulty in addressing the problem. With regard to BSE, we are now establishing this group and it is important that it is done now. A recent report suggested that Irish beef was more susceptible than British beef. That is nonsense and was so described in the response of the Food Safety Authority. All risk material is removed from Irish beef before it gets to the consumer and now only cattle less than 30 months are made available for human consumption.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in respect of payments under the various 2000 headage and premium schemes is that some £658 million has already been paid to date. This compares quite favourably with the position at the same time last year when £622 million had been paid. I expect EURO compensation payments of some £14 million under the livestock schemes to commence within the next week. EURO compensation of almost £5 million has already been paid to REPS participants.</P>
      <P>Balancing payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 31 January 2001. The present position is that 96% of applicants have been paid more than £154 million under this scheme. Some 2,500 applications which remain unpaid are query cases and payments will be made as problems are resolved.</P>
      <P>With regard to the special beef premium scheme, balancing payments commenced on 7 February 2001. Overall, 98% of applications have attracted payments valued at £186 million under this scheme. The number of remaining applications &ndash; about 4,000 &ndash; involve queries and payments will issue as the problems associated with the applications are resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final instalment under the 2000 ewe pre<Col N="1140" /> mium scheme was paid on 16 February 2001 &ndash; the earliest possible date following publication of the regulation. Some 98% of applicants under this scheme have been paid £77.4 million. Some 1,000 applications which remain unpaid are query cases and any outstanding payments will be made as problems are resolved.</P>
    <P>As regards the 2000 slaughter premium scheme and the national envelope, balancing payments are expected to commence in April when the quota usage for the year of application is determined. Some £34 million has been paid to beef producers under these two schemes to date. Payment of an additional £1.3 million can be released if the 13,800 producers' acknowledgements requiring only the herd owner's signature are returned by farmers.</P>
    <P>Payments, amounting to £112 million have been made under the disadvantaged areas headage schemes to 96% of applicants. About 4,500 problem cases remain unpaid and any outstanding payments are being made as quickly as problems are resolved. Some 99.6% of all applicants under the arable aid scheme have been paid £93.4 million.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 2000 extensification scheme are expected to commence in June 2001. However, 11,000 census forms still have to be returned by farmers despite the issue of reminders. No payment can be made to farmers unless they return these forms.</P>

In many instances these are relatively minor queries and I urge the Minister of State to err on the side of making the payment whenever possible. It is not difficult to recover payment in the unlikely event that that should arise. Given that farmers are experiencing more financial pressure than at any time in the recent past will the Minister of State ensure that any payments that can be made are made?</P>

Is it possible for either the Minister of State or the Minister to ensure that this evening a phone call will be made to each of the livestock offices and where a telephone contact with the farmer would solve the issue that call will be made? Most of the time it can easily be done in that way. We appreciate the reason for census forms and it is hard to make a case for anyone who does not return them.

      <P>In reply to the first question, every effort will be made to try to pay those who are eligible for payment. For most schemes 96% of applicants or more have been paid. We have to recognise that there will be a number of cases in the remaining 2%, 3% or 4%, depending on the scheme, which will not ever be eligible for payment because they have not complied with the terms of the scheme. Nothing can be done about that. If a farmer has broken a fundamental rule of the scheme payment cannot be made. Nobody will ever announce 100% payment to everyone who applied. They can announce 100% payment to those who applied and complied with the terms of the scheme. Therefore, the margins are smaller than the gross figures I gave for outstanding applications. Every effort will be made to expedite payment. Expediting payment is a two-way process and applicants must facilitate it. In regard to the extensification scheme, every effort will be made to try to bring the date forward as far as possible. There is little point in looking for something if applicants have not done their part of the work.</P>

      <P>There is not at this stage any EU Commission proposal to introduce a fixed ewe premium. This suggestion was included in a consultant's report to the Commission as one of a number of possible amendments to the EU sheepmeat regime. The Commission's response to this report in the form of formal proposals is still awaited, although it is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>While a fixed premium has some advantages over a variable premium, particularly in that it provides a greater degree of certainty to producers about the level of the premium, it has the significant disadvantage that, unlike a variable premium, it is not increased when prices fall. In view of this, in the event that the Commission comes forward with a proposal for a fixed premium, I will seek to have the premium fixed at a significantly higher level than that which has obtained in recent years.</P>

This issue is determined by the mechanism put in place and whether there is a safety net if prices go through the floor.

      <P>We have to be careful to see how the situation evolves and to make sure our decisions are not divorced from the reality of what is most advantageous for farmers in the long term as regards payments. Legitimate concerns have been expressed that the premium as it has operated has not been a fair reflection of market prices received by farmers.

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The foot and mouth disease crisis highlighted the need for extensive new powers to control the movement of animals into the State. Accordingly, the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, has been amended to provide extensive new powers to authorised persons in my Department to police the movement of animals to prevent the spread of disease as well as powers to restrict animal movement. There is also provision for the imposition of very stiff penalties and-or terms of imprisonment and forfeiture of property where any individual is convicted of an offence under the legislation.</P>
      <P>This legislation also gives my Department the powers to register and approve dealers and to regulate their activities. The Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 to 2001 (Approval and Registration of Dealers and Dealers' Premises) Order, 2001 (S.I. No. 79 of 2001), has been signed. This regulation provides for the registration and approval of all persons dealing in cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry, and their premises, and makes it illegal for a dealer to operate without such approval and registration. It also regulates the operation of dealers and lays down their obligations and responsibilities as regards the keeping of records, the provision of information relating to their operations and the standard of premises. The regulation provides for the revocation or suspension of approval and registration of a dealer and also for refusal to approve or register a dealer. It makes it illegal for any person to buy from or sell to a dealer animals or poultry unless the dealer is approved and registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of the new regulations were dis<Col N="1144" /> cussed at a meeting between Department officials and representatives of cattle dealers on 23 March last. The meeting provided the opportunity for a useful exchange of views between both parties. The Department provided clarification concerning the new obligations of dealers following the recent amendment of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, and the coming into force of S.I. No. 79 of 2001 on the approval and registration of dealers and dealers' premises. The criteria for approval of dealers and dealers' premises were outlined as were the proposed mechanics for the registration and approval system. The representatives of dealers generally welcomed the new regulations and it was agreed to hold further meetings over the coming weeks as necessary to review and clarify the regulations under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a misapprehension among the dealers' representatives as to the true intent of the Act and how it impinges upon them? What movement exemptions will be allowed under the new permit system? I understood that the Minister gave Deputy Dukes and me a commitment that S.I. No. 79 of 2001, which deals with the restriction of movements, would be brought before the House so we would have an input into the detail which is extremely important as regards the operation of the Act. Is the instrument a <i>fait accompli</i> in that it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will become law after 21 days? I thought we would have an opportunity to make an input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Act will ensure that dealers and their premises are registered and approved and that they comply with strict conditions. Stiff penalties are provided for where people do not observe the provisions.</P>
      <P>I have a copy of the statutory instrument which has been signed and is in effect. The record of the House will show that we agreed that the amendment to the legislation would apply for the remainder of the year and that, towards the end of the year, we would bring the entire legislation before the House. This will give all Members an opportunity to debate and, if necessary, amend the legislation with the benefit of experience of how it is operating.</P>
      <P>Deputies Penrose and Dukes strongly urged that it is preferable that statutory instruments are debated in the House rather than being signed and placed in the Oireachtas Library. This facility was used on this occasion because of the difficulties posed by the foot and mouth disease and the pressure of time. However, I reiterate my commitment that we will discuss the legislation before the end of the year at which time statutory instruments will go through the full process of debate in the House before being signed into law.</P>

As regards the necessary restrictions on the movement of animals, will the Minister's advisory committee keep under review the possibility of farmers being allowed to sell suck calves? In a dairy area such as my constituency the sale of calves has always been an important source of income in the early part of the year, particularly for small farmers such as those I represent. Many farmers are experiencing difficulties due to the lack of fodder and feed. Will the Minister instruct the committee and his advisers to keep this restriction under review?</P>

      <P>What regulations does the Minister propose to put in place concerning dealers who operate from outside the State? Will he seek a meeting with his counterpart in Northern Ireland to ensure the same regulations apply? No one should be allowed to deal in the South other than those who have dealer or herd numbers. This is particularly so given that the current problem was exported to us by unscrupulous dealers in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties regarding suck or drop calves and the sale of store cattle are becoming fairly acute. I will put that matter before the expert group. As a cautionary note, animal-to-animal movements constitute the highest risk activity for the spread of the disease. The economy must continue, however, and the expert group is undertaking an economic risk analysis of various activities, including AI services, as I mentioned earlier. If we want calves next year that will have to be restored, but one can imagine the risk involved where people are handling cattle and going on to other farms &ndash; it is lethal if one does not have strict regulations concerning disinfection and hygiene facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a statutory instrument, the record shows that I gave a commitment to review the <Col N="1146" /> legislation before the end of the year. That is the way it will be done and nothing else was promised in any shape or form. There will be two months for dealers to upgrade their premises. When they are approved and have their herd numbers there will be no difficulty for them. Deputy Johnny Brady inquired about young cattle and the same thing applies to them. Hardship is being caused and I will put the matter before the expert group. I will be guided by the scientific advice available to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis raised the question of dealers outside the jurisdiction. First and foremost, the source of foot and mouth infection was the Far East. It came into Britain through swill which was fed to pigs, but which had not been treated adequately, and from there on the disease spread through Britain. A consignment of sheep came from Britain to the North of Ireland for slaughtering, although they did not go for slaughter. Some of them were held in a premises in Meigh for a relatively short time. That particular dealer illegally transferred some of those sheep to premises in the Republic. We are extremely fortunate that we have been able to follow leads, even though it took a considerable time to cull those sheep that came into this jurisdiction. It is critically important to insist on the same high level of premises and approval for dealers outside the jurisdiction as applies here.</P>
    <P>The real tragedy for people in other countries, including France, for example, is that the loop went from Britain to the North of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and onto France. Another dealer with a premises at Mayenne created infection in France and calves from Ireland went from there to the Netherlands which now has ten cases of foot and mouth disease. There is extreme concern in Italy because livestock from the same premises in Mayenne were brought there.</P>
    <P>It is imperative for high standards to apply to dealers' premises through which large numbers of livestock pass. As a result of the foot and mouth crisis we have learned much more about the amount of traffic in livestock and the distances livestock travel, including overnight stops and holding in premises. In such cases, the very highest level of hygiene and layerage must apply so that transmission of the disease cannot be facilitated by carelessness and lack of proper standards.</P>

      <Quest>the number of farmers who have responded to date under the herd reconciliation census of cattle on farms at the end of December 2000; the number of applications still outstanding; the actions being taken to encourage and remind farmers of the importance of having accurate and up-dated herd records; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Col N="1147" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the herd reconciliation project is to confirm that cattle which the cattle movement monitoring system &ndash; CMMS &ndash; recorded as being in the herd on 31 December 2000 were actually in those herds on that date, to collect details of cattle that were not so recorded and to update the database accordingly. It will be recalled that the CMMS database was developed to guarantee the origin, identity and life history of Irish cattle entering the food chain. The CMMS, which contains information on millions of events in the life of the Irish cattle herd, was developed progressively over a number of years beginning with the recording of calf birth registrations from 1996 onwards. However, as full recording of movements and disposal of cattle did not come into operation until the beginning of 2000, the data recorded on animal locations may not be up to date in all cases.</P>
      <P>The herd reconciliation project is therefore a very important milestone in the further development of the CMMS. It will ensure the complete accuracy and integrity of the CMMS cattle traceability system. The project will also have further practical benefits in that it will allow the database to be used more widely for EU premia payments and many other schemes affecting farmers, thus reducing the administrative burden for farmers associated with such payments.</P>
      <P>The mechanics of the project are that all cattle events recorded on computer in 2000, including births, on-farm deaths, exports, slaughtering, movements and premia applications, were analysed and a last known location-herd number for each cattle tag number was established. The year 2000 was selected as a basis for the exercise because it provided the most comprehensive and up-to-date information available. A statement listing the cattle in each herd was generated for each farmer and farmers were asked to confirm, add to or amend the details of the statement as appropriate. Some 130,000 statements were issued to farmers in the first weeks of January this year. The issuing of the statements was accompanied by an extensive radio and press publicity campaign. Of the approximately 130,000 farmers involved, 121,520 have responded. Therefore, 7,444 farmers have not responded and they have been reminded on a number of occasions to send back their details. In early April, a further letter will be issued to all remaining farmers who have still failed to respond, reminding them of their obligations and the consequences of not doing so. Failure to respond after that date will leave my Department with no option but to render the animals in question ineligible for premia pending clarification of their status under the herd reconciliation project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House can be assured more generally that every opportunity is taken to remind farmers of the importance of having accurate and fully updated herd records. The current foot and mouth crisis highlights the critical role that a comprehensive animal tracing system can play both in the control of the spread of animal disease and in <Col N="1148" /> providing reassurances to consumers and customers regarding Irish livestock products. There is a responsibility on all parties, particularly farmers, to play their role in this matter.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the need for all this information to be available and properly placed on the record. Was the Minister as shocked as I was, however, by the initial information that came out? There was a massive difference between the information that should have been given and what actually appeared on the information sheets for farmers. If the Minister has carried out an analysis on that matter will he let us know what the situation is? We welcome the idea but from dealing with farmers I know that there was a major difference between what should have been contained in the information and what actually appeared.</P>

      <P>Yes, some discrepancies were found, in addition to some unusual practices. The data coming into the Department are being assessed, but until we get the full response we cannot go into the matter in detail. Nonetheless, accuracy levels of over 90% have been confirmed from the preliminary results of the data processed. That is very encouraging for the first attempt at this matter. It means that when we have it absolutely right we will have a comprehensive picture of the national cattle herd, which will be helpful not alone in recording animal identification and disease, but also for assuring quality control systems. We will be able to tell our customers both here and abroad that the meat they are consuming is from a particular herd. We will also be able to identify the particular farms on which the cattle were raised. The results have been very encouraging so far, but in one or two counties the registration of twins was a bit higher than in other counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to abattoirs generally is that, under EU regulations, those slaughtering more than 1,000 livestock units per annum must comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1997. Smaller abattoirs with a throughput of less than 1,000 livestock units per annum are licensed by my Department under the Abattoirs Act, 1988. They are derogated from certain structural provisions of the EU directives. They are, however, required to achieve minimum standards regarding hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. Once licensed by my Department, the operation of day-to-day controls is a matter for the relevant local authority under the overall control of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the important role played by domestic abattoirs within the wider food sector and this has been reflected in the approach adopted by my Department to establishments which have demonstrated a willingness to comply <Col N="1150" /> with the regulations. Given that consumer protection must be our absolute priority, my Department has no option, however, but to refuse to license those premises which are not prepared to achieve the minimum standard required.</P>
    <P>Financial aid for abattoirs falls within the ambit of the processing and marketing provisions of the EU guidelines for State aid in the agriculture sector. One such provision stipulates that aid may only be granted to enterprises which comply with existing minimum standards regarding hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. While it is not possible, therefore, to provide funding to achieve minimum hygiene standards, there are possibilities for financial aid in circumstances which involve rationalisation, research and development, human resources, training and so on. In a series of meetings between my Department and the association representing small abattoirs, the criteria which would apply to such financial aid were outlined and the association was invited to submit proposals.</P>
    <P>I have recently received a submission from the Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland entitled, Food for the Future, in which it is seeking support for the retention of the family butcher-local abattoir. This submission is being examined by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Department is giving consideration to the submission received from the Department from the Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland. There are products available to consumers through the traditional route from producer to small abattoir to family butcher. Consumers understand that meat sourced through this route has qualities which cannot be replicated by more industrialised forms of production. The meat to which I refer emanates from animals locally reared, grass fed, hand-picked and protected from stress. These animals are then slaughtered by skilled butchers which ensures the meat is of improved quality, taste and tenderness. When one considers that traceability and food safety provisions have been adhered to in the killing of these animals and the fact that butchers possess an awareness of the particular requirements and tastes of their customers, it is clear that the product to which I refer is special. I remind the Minister of State that my constituency colleague, when labouring in the vineyard of south-west Cork during the last general election campaign, assured that every family butcher received an assurance that aid and assistance would be given towards the promotion of their trade.</P>

      <P>Has the Department made a deliberate attempt to cause confusion in this area? Are butchers being told one version of the story while the House is being told another? The guidelines indicate that where investments are made in order to comply with newly introduced minimum standards regarding the environment, hygiene and animal welfare, aid may be granted in order to reach new standards. In recent months I was informed that the investment had to be made on a greenfield site. What is the position? Commissioner Fischler has set out that an exception will be made for such investments provided they do not lead to an increase in slaughtering capacity and that people may invest in order to bring establishments into line with Community health standards. Family butchers want to obtain such aid in order to bring their establishments into line. It is important that good quality meat be available locally, particularly in the light of the current foot and mouth outbreak.</P>

      <P>Tá go maith. Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt anseo ar an mBille Iascaigh (Leasú), 2000, mar is Bille é a thugann cumhachtaí don bhord nach raibh acu cheana fein agus, le cúnamh Dé, a chuirfidh feabhas ar an obair a dhéanfaidh siad amach anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of aquaculture has been generally the focus of this debate, more widely than what the Bill involves. I take this opportunity to set out <Col N="1154" /> what the Green Party will be proposing in that area, given that we are dealing with farming the sea and fresh water, known as culture fisheries as opposed to capture fisheries, and this will play an increasingly vital role in protein production in the world. For the most part, however, that should be done in an energy efficient way low down on the food chain.</P>
    <P>Green Party policy would be to introduce incentives to encourage more research into small scale, self-contained, ecologically sound fish farms which utilise agricultural and other organic and processed waste and to phase out systems with excessive crowding based partly on fishmeal and open to the surrounding eco-system, with all the risk that implies in terms of escape of farmed fish and interbreeding with wild stocks, as well as pollution, disease and parasites as have been mentioned already.</P>
    <P>The other type of fish farming which is fairly sound ecologically is ocean ranching which will have more chance of succeeding if, for example, the food supply of the released young salmon is saved from destruction by industrial fishing through international regulations and monitoring. Salmon fishermen should be given a fair role in the onshore recapture facilities for the ranched fish. These fish would not interfere with the normal restocking of salmon and sea trout which would return up the rivers.</P>
    <P>Shellfish farming is basically ecologically sound and should be encouraged more, especially through interest free loans from a marine credit union, for example, which we would like to see promoted and subsidised by the State as a fiscal measure that would also be used to encourage more ecologically sound capture fisheries.</P>
    <P>An action plan is needed both for market development and to address the serious problem arising from increasing red tides, as they are called, and toxic algae. Restocking projects for various crustacean and mollusc species should be fully encouraged on a co-operation basis. Shellfish and sea plant farming, if properly supported, could be an important part of regional policy.</P>
    <P>More generally, a co-ordinated approach is urgently needed not only from the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance, the Environment and Local Government, Defence, etc., and various other agencies but also in terms of the coastal zone management concept which will reduce the conflicting pressures on the coastline and help to conserve vulnerable eco-systems.</P>
    <P>An example would be for various bodies to work together to implement freshwater catchment plans linked into coastal management. Within this strategy, the regional fishery boards should be revamped and given greater powers and funding to deal with seriously deteriorating water quality and other threats to freshwater and coastal eco-systems. As an interim measure, the agreed recommendations in the Marine Institute's Towards a Marine Policy for Ireland 1996 report should be implemented. That applies <Col N="1155" /> across the board to all marine activities as it would be a vast improvement on the current position.</P>
    <P>In relation to this legislation, there is a need to discriminate between desirable and undesirable practices in aquaculture and those practices which affect aquaculture. As I mentioned previously, there are well planned and organised small, self-contained aquaculture ventures and more damaging open, fishmeal based ventures which are bedevilled by fish escaping and mixing with native stock, for example. The Bill contains some improvements but the points I want to make will hopefully improve on those measures. The Bill is quite short but it has implications which are more broad ranging.</P>
    <P>Section 2 refers to providing the main reasons and considerations on which a determination of an appeal is based. One has to wonder why somebody would be given the job of trying to summarise all the detail and come up with the main reasons. Who decides what are the main reasons as opposed to other reasons? Is it necessary to summarise the information? It would be more responsible and thorough to simply give the reasons without having to qualify them. The Minister of State mentioned a summary of the reasons. There is no reason an A to Z approach could not be adopted. The reasons given should be valid. There is a need to go further in giving the reasons an appeal is refused or the information is required. The board is not covered by the freedom of information legislation. As a State board, it should be covered by that legislation in the same way as other State bodies. That would eliminate any talk about the main reason because the information would be on the record.</P>
    <P>Section 4 focuses on the consultant or adviser who may inspect the land, foreshore or area of water to which an appeal under the chapter relates. My understanding is that it is not sufficient to have the power to visit a water or land based area. There must be an obligation on whoever is visiting to be suitably qualified to carry out a proper inspection. I am talking about someone who would have a thorough scientific knowledge of the habitats in question and who would know how to deal with the impact which, for example, the development of shellfish or fin fish would have on a natural habitat. We need more expertise in shellfish development. This is important given that a number of these proposals are in special areas of conservation. It is grossly irresponsible and negligent not to have that type of expertise. I hope that can be dealt with on Committee Stage and that the Minister of State refers to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>When a visit is being paid to an area by a consultant or adviser, it is important that they meet not only the developer or the proposer of the development but also the bodies in favour of it and those which are concerned about it because of its negative impact. It is not an objective operation to meet only the proposer of the develop<Col N="1156" /> ment who will talk up all the advantages and avoid mentioning any negative points. It is responsible to be objective about it and to either meet both sides or none. In the interests of acquiring as rounded a view as possible of the application for an aquaculture development, the inspector should meet both sides of the debate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that many aquaculture developments are in SACs. It should be a basic requirement for an inspector to notify Dúchas before an inspection takes place so that there is a seamless approach by the State. It should not be the case that one Department is at loggerheads with another as this gives a bad impression to the public and leads it to believe that different policies are operating within the one Government. Advance notification to Dúchas of an inspection by an inspector would help in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned growing aquaculture in a sustainable way. If it is to be sustainable, there is a need for operators who want to become involved in aquaculture to be trained. It is not adequate for an operator to submit a proposal without satisfying people that he or she is properly trained in what he or she is doing. It is a long standing complaint by the fishing community that there are not more training facilities run by FÁS or vocational education committees. It seems one must go to Greencastle to get any training in fishing. We are a long way behind in providing training in aquaculture. Perhaps the Minister of State might refer to that in his reply.</P>
    <P>An impression is given in section 4 that oral hearings are discouraged. It seems that people have been asked to pay a fee of £60 for an oral hearing which subsequently is not granted. People have complained to me that they did not get their money back. If there is not an oral hearing, why is the money not returned to the person? That should be addressed because it is unfair. It sounds like the State is being mean-minded in taking £60 and then keeping it even if the oral hearing is refused. If an application for an oral hearing is turned down, the reasons for that decision should be indicated. This is a basic tenet of providing information. If the information is available, people should be told why the oral hearing was refused.</P>
    <P>The appeals board must deal with many issues. Does the Minister of State regard unregulated coastal fishing as part of its remit? In my area of north County Dublin and in north Leinster generally the unregulated fishing of razor shellfish is an absolute scandal and a national disgrace. It is probably too late to regulate it at this stage. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Government have been aware for years of the unregulated fishing of razor shellfish by people who are not licensed and who are getting into fishing because it is unregulated and they do not have to follow the normal quota procedures. If the Minister of State walked along King Strand in Balbriggan and up to the Mosney area, he would see the decimation of young razor shellfish which are too small to be sold. Their <Col N="1157" /> remains litter the coast. The same is true in the Boyne valley, which I am sure Deputy Bell mentioned. The mussel fisheries there have been wiped out as a result of the Department granting licences for dredging.</P>
    <P>There is a conflict between the different interests in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. The Minister of State has a responsibility to ensure those interests do not clash. The activities in the marine sector should complement each other rather than conflict with one other. One activity, for example, is the disposal of waste, particularly oil, from trawlers which washes up on the coastline. The Minister of State may be serious about developing aquaculture, but it sounds hollow if ports do not have facilities for trawlers and if measures are not enforced which make the fishing community realise it is unacceptable to pollute the seas and to destroy the marine and coastal environments.</P>
    <P>That is happening and people are looking for assistance to set up facilities at harbours for oil collection and to clean up the fishing industry from the polluting effects of an unscrupulous minority. They are allowed to get away with destroying the livelihoods and the environment of people who depend on the fishing industry, through aquaculture and trawling. The Minister needs to show leadership in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a serious and worsening problem as fishing becomes more and more difficult as an employment. People are becoming more hard-pressed. Putting in facilities and ensuring safeguards are in place to combat pollution tends to suffer when people are under pressure and feel they are not being heard and are not being given due respect for their activities. The members of the fishing community constantly remind me that the fisheries have suffered because of our membership of the EU. It has been said many times that £2 billion worth of fish was taken out of Irish waters by EU boats every year and Ireland's share is about £100 million. One way of looking at it is that Ireland gives £2 billion in structural aid to the rest of the EU in the form of fish every year. A large amount of ground needs to be made up by the Government on behalf of the fishing community and the marine environment, given that in our negotiations with our EU partners, the fishing interests of this country were the ones to suffer, more than any other sector. Farmers may disagree given the current crisis, but over the years fishermen have felt as if they were the Cinderella of Ireland's interests. This must now be recognised.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to develop aquaculture unless we come to terms with the pollution of our seas. The quality of the product relates directly to a clean marine environment. Many other factors contribute to pollution at sea but the factors which are under the control of the Department of the Environment and the Department of the Marine, in particular, should be the ones to be dealt with first. It is ironic that our EU partners claim Irish fishing waters to be open for all EU <Col N="1158" /> boats and yet when it comes to defending the fishing interests of Ireland and the EU, it is the Irish Government which is expected to provide the defence and naval facilities to patrol those waters. The map of Ireland is regarded by many as being in the shape of a teddy bear. However, the extent of Irish waters beyond the land mass of Ireland makes the map of Irish territories and seas look like a huge oyster shell. The Minister for the Marine has a responsibility to redefine in the Irish mind what constitutes Ireland: a great deal of water and very little land. This fact must be recognised if our fisheries are to be protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Perry and Finucane. I have to admit that I am not the most well read on this Bill. I listened to Deputy Sargent with some interest as he is an expert in that area, much more so than I am&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's modesty is killing me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I did not call the Minister an expert yet. I agree with Deputy Sargent's remarks about our accession to the EU. If any industry lost out, it was the fishing industry and I have no doubt successive governments were to blame. The fishing industry lacked an organised lobby which the agricultural sector had and it was short-sightedness on all governments' parts. It is one of our great natural resources and it is now struggling. All the facilities and financial resources at the Government's disposal should be put in place for the industry. The export potential of our fish products is excellent.</P>
      <P>I question the Minister on some points in his speech. Aquaculture has a role to play in regional economic development, especially on the west coast. Freshwater aquaculture is carried on in Lough Allen in County Leitrim and the operators have been doing well for several years. There was a complaint from one of the Lough Allen operators about the licensing system and the length of time taken to process the licences. A year's trading was lost because of the delay in the issue of a licence.</P>
      <P>The Minister notes in his speech: &ldquo;it is only proper in the interests of transparency and fairness of procedure, that all future determinations of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board shall be examined, explained when made, and the board shall, on request, give a summary of the main reasons and considerations for past determinations.&rdquo; If a decision is appealed, an applicant should not be given a summary but should be informed of all the reasons for the refusal of his appeal. Most individuals going into this business are committed and see a future role for themselves there, but it is all dependent on the issue of a licence. A summary is not good enough. They are all entitled to a full explanation of the decision and it would also be an exercise in transparency. Perhaps the Minister could consider this point on Committee or Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> I remember when I was elected to the House that in 1987 one of the main issues was fish farming in Connemara and the detrimental effects of sea lice on the area's tourism industry. Connemara was famous for its sea trout fishing but the establishment of salmon farms brought sea lice into the waters and killed the sea trout. The creation of one industry resulted in the decimation of another. I have not received correspondence on this matter for some time and I presume the problem was resolved. If it has been proven that sea lice were introduced as a result of salmon farming, we must bear that in mind when issuing licences.</P>
    <P>How does the industry affect water quality? We are all aware of the EU reports which state that the water quality around our coastline is poor as a result of sewage and industrial waste pollution. This detracts from Ireland's clean image as the Emerald Isle. If aquaculture is to survive, we must ensure high standards of water quality. The Minister and his colleagues in the Department of the Environment and Local Government should take these matters into consideration. If we develop a reputation for poor water quality, we will experience huge difficulties in marketing our fresh and farmed seafood products.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently well read to make in-depth suggestions on possible improvements to this Bill but my colleagues will doubtless table amendments on Committee Stage to ensure the Bill lays the foundations for a progressive aquaculture industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate although I am not an expert on these matters. It is very important that the independent licensing appeals is allowed to carry out its functions in as effective, efficient and transparent a manner as possible. People in the industry must be assured the appeals process is fair. A solid licensing framework is necessary to facilitate the development of aquaculture to its full potential. The industry, which has not yet reached its full potential, employs more than 3,000 people and generates an annual income of £67 million. As an island nation, the development of the aquaculture industry is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I occasionally listen to &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; when travelling home to Sligo on a Thursday evening. There was a considerable degree of controversy on last week's programme about the licensing of boats. It appears some vessels were being registered and licensed in other jurisdictions due to the harsh taxation system here. The view was expressed that the Minister for Finance had failed to provide sufficient tax concessions on tonnage. As I understand it, a certain tariff is levied per tonne on Irish-registered vessels whereas there is a ceiling on charges in the British Isles and other areas. Perhaps that does not come within the remit of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources but I would welcome the Minister's <Col N="1160" /> views. It would be very disappointing if people who had invested heavily in shipping vessels were to continue to register them elsewhere. That would be a big loss to the industry here.</P>
    <P>A socio-economic study on the impact of aquaculture on four counties on the Atlantic seaboard has found indisputable evidence that it significantly boosts peripheral areas. People in one Connemara community believed the locality would have died out were it not for the aquaculture industry. The same applies to communities in Donegal, Sligo and other areas in which people have an affinity with the sea and depend upon it for a livelihood. A further study published by the Marine Institute recommends that the industry should be given development priority and investment support from both the public and private sectors. Does the Minister envisage the introduction of public-private partnerships or tax incentives to encourage people to invest in this high cost industry? It would be important to provide such incentives to encourage investment in new processing plants etc.</P>
    <P>The study bases it findings on the industry's performance to date in dependent communities in Galway, Donegal, Cork and Kerry. A case study of Kilkeerin Bay in south-west Galway revealed that unemployment and emigration levels would be higher and that fewer young people would build houses and raise young families in the area in the absence of the opportunities presented by the aquaculture industry which is still in its infancy. If we are to develop a good reputation in fish farming in regard to issues such as traceability, quality processing mechanisms etc., we must be disciplined from the outset.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry complements the traditional skill of boat building which must also be encouraged to avoid the fragmentation of the cultural identities of coastal communities. This is a high risk business from the perspective of individuals and investors alike but investment is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>One case study found that unemployment levels were around the national average in a population of just over 6,000. Case studies indicate the viability and risk factors involved in various projects. Positive case studies on this matter will encourage other communities to become involved in the industry. At least seven ancillary industries in the area, which generate £1 million in wages for 120 full-time and 30 part-time jobs, depend totally or heavily on fin fish farming.</P>
    <P>The industry is also a tourism attraction and it is important it is encouraged. Salmon farming companies in Kilkerrin Bay recorded sales of £6.26 million in 1997 with 70 jobs tied up in finfish and aquaculture alone. That says a great deal. The development of salmon farming is very important because, despite it having a bad image, for whatever reason, with people involved with wild salmon, it is a huge growth area in terms of the economy and exports such as smoked salmon.</P>
    <P>Irish fish farmers welcomed the merger of two of the world's leading players in the aquaculture <Col N="1161" /> market &ndash; Hydro Seafood of Norway and the Dutch owned Nutreco Holding NZ. Both multinationals have Irish interests as part of their existing global network. Hydro Seafood employs 165 people in Fanad, County Donegal, while Nutreco's aquaculture subsidiary employs more than 40 in a salmon feed production base in Westport. This merger will create the world's largest salmon farming company with a projected output of 150,000 tonnes annually, ten times the size of Irish production alone and representing about 20% of the global share of the salmon market. It is very good the Irish are part of that and it is important we have access to a huge market. Hydro Seafood has 1,500 employees internationally and had a turnover of £220 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Irish Salmon Growers' Association said that both Hydro Seafood and Nutreco were strong supporters of the Irish salmon rearing industry through their respective companies in Donegal and Mayo. I do not know the exact nature of the relationship between those companies and the Minister of State's Department, but I do not doubt it played a major role in encouraging them to the State. I am sure they sought grants and that the Minister of State provided the money to encourage them. That makes sense when one is conducting business with world players who can guarantee exports and it is very encouraging.</P>
    <P>I know from being a retailer that people are seeking alternatives to meat, and I have seen the growth in sales of fresh trout and salmon. Fish is a huge industry whereas, years ago, it was a diet for Lent. It is stocked every day of the week in most supermarkets because sales of it are huge. It is an industry which must be encouraged, and so should sales of fish on the domestic market. The business is huge and we should pride ourselves on the quality of the product.</P>
    <P>We can command excellence in this area because of our reputation for doing things correctly. Therefore, regulations are important. It is also important that people licensed for the trade conduct their business correctly. The Minister of State does not want cowboy operators who are in it for the grant and the fast buck and who give the industry a bad name. They will do more harm than good. The Minister of State will be much better off being selective about who he allows into the business and approving a handful of good people committed to the idea of producing a quality product and conducting business in an ethical manner. This will ensure that Irish produce will withstand any checks worldwide. The Bill will introduce regulations to the trade in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has allocated £25 million for the aquaculture industry under the national development plan. That is important and it is also important that the spending of that money and by whom is properly monitored. Accountability is very important, not so much in terms of value for money but in light of the fact that public private <Col N="1162" /> partnerships will be involved which will match that funding pound for pound. It will encourage people in the industry with a vision. The funding is also important in that it will create jobs and give an alternative enterprise to people who love the business.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his work in this very important industry. The Government has announced funding for a pier in Rosses Point in County Sligo, something I appreciate. Mullaghmore is also a coastal town in County Sligo and State funding for aquaculture there is very much appreciated. It is a good start and I compliment the Government on taking a lead in what will be a major industry for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. I am concerned that statements made in the House indicating that everything is well and happy in the aquaculture business will go unchallenged. The industry is anything but so. The practices of aquaculture in Ireland have led to a massive breakdown in the eco-system, especially on the west coast where aquaculture is practised very intensely. Sea trout have vanished from many of the traditional and lucrative fisheries on the west coast and arising from that disappearance, there has been large scale unemployment there. Tourism has suffered dreadfully. It is proven beyond doubt that the aquacultural practices of fish farms have led to lice infestation of the smolts of sea trout which has led to their deaths in large numbers and to a decline in their numbers. Likewise, the smolts of wild salmon are now being infested by sea lice and their numbers are declining seriously.</P>
      <P>The value of wild sea trout and wild salmon is much greater than any aquacultural business. There is a place for properly managed aquaculture but we do not have properly placed or managed aquaculture. That is not the fault of the Minister of State who is moving in the right direction to ensure it is properly placed and well managed. It is possible to have a thriving aquaculture business and to have it in such a way that the return of wild sea trout and wild salmon can be encouraged to many rivers denuded of these species.</P>
      <P>Another speaker mentioned the salmon farming methods used. These are being used and championed by the State in the salmon research station beside Newport. They have been very successful. Large numbers of salmon are returning to lakes and rivers arising from those practices and fishermen at sea are also getting their share of these fish. That is the way to go. If fish must be reared in cages, let it be done in places where it will not do terminal damage to what has been a traditional industry, namely, tourism based on angling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to this debate &ndash; Deputy Connaughton, Deputy Bell, the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, Deputy Kenny and <Col N="1163" /> Deputy Sheehan, without whose contribution the consideration of no Bill in this area would be complete, Deputy Ellis, Deputy Sargent, Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Perry, who modestly said they did not know that much about the area but proceeded to amaze me, and Deputy Stagg who was the only one who took the opposite point of view. It is important in any debate that such a view is taken. I compliment him on doing so and, if I have the opportunity, I will deal with his concerns. Otherwise, so as not to bring Members back another day, I will deal with them on Committee.</P>
      <P>I thank my staff, especially Mr. Thomas Tobin, for their wonderful work. As Members indicated, licensing in this area has never been easy. It is much more transparent now that all the agencies are made aware that a licence is being sought. There is also an appeals board. It is unlikely that any licence application that goes through my Department and Mr. Thomas Tobin will be appealed because it is usually so watertight. I thank Mr. Tobin and the staff in that regard.</P>
      <P>I assure the House, in these difficult days for farming and the country, that the marine and forestry sectors are playing their part in trying to keep this terrible plague out of Ireland. We are fortunate to have someone of the calibre and statesmanship of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, dealing with the matter. Most people in Ireland and perhaps elsewhere believe the right man is in the right place at the right time. I assure the House that we will play our part in discouraging people from crossing land for marine activities.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Stagg's concerns, I am proud to work with an industry that has a vested interest in the health of the product it produces. Ireland has accessed probably the best market in the world in France. Given the French palate, Ireland's penetration of that market is a strong vote of confidence. However, the Deputy's point is that no activity is perfect. I intend to continue the efforts to improve the industry and the quality standards in as transparent a manner as possible.</P>
      <P>I was pleased Deputy Connaughton was present for the debate almost to the end. Retrospection will apply under the Bill. If it is passed, as I expect it will be because every speaker was so progressive and supportive of it, retrospection will apply from the date the first licence is granted. I am sure the Deputy will be glad to know this. The details of past decisions by the appeals board will help the Department in its consideration of the method used to grant licences. When I grant a licence, I want to be sure that everyone has had their say. Deputy Connaughton asked about the number of licences. There are approximately 250 licence applications in hand at present and I will deal with those as quickly as possible, although I will be careful not to overlook any aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be great if legislation was unnecessary and a voluntary code sufficed. However, a voluntary code called CLAMS &ndash; the co-ordinated <Col N="1164" /> local aquaculture management system &ndash; has been introduced where everybody in a bay is invited to meet and express their views. This may address some of Deputy Stagg's concerns. Environmentalists, anglers, inshore fishermen and tourism, shipping and aquaculture representatives are invited to discuss the zoning of a bay area. This ensures that everybody has their say and is happy with the activities of others. It is working well in the areas in which it is operational.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond to it. A dramatic headline in a Sunday newspaper and reports in other newspapers this week could threaten the reputation of Irish beef. It is important that the Minister takes this opportunity to put on the record the facts as he and the Government view them.</P>
      <P>The reports stated that hundreds of cattle with BSE entered the food chain in Ireland last year. The report by the British Food Standards Agency &ndash; FSA &ndash; claimed that 22,000 cattle were infected between 1985 and 1996. As we are aware, the total recorded number now stands at approximately 638 for that period. Given the current crisis in the agriculture industry and the distress and uncertainty experienced by farm families, it is vital that the Minister deals with this serious and frightening allegation swiftly and firmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said on the Order of Business earlier this week that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development disagreed strongly with the implications of this predictive statistical study. The Department has been <Col N="1165" /> quoted as disagreeing fundamentally with the findings, but I ask the Minister to give the House and consumers a full explanation of how such figures could be found by this apparently reputable body and why they are wrong. Any hint or suggestion that the correct figures for BSE were being covered up or deliberately played down in Ireland would do untold damage to our exports and consumer confidence at home. I ask the Minister to declare the facts with full back-up details and empirical evidence. I hope the philosophy that has been proved in the past in relation to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development releasing as little information as possible will not continue in this instance. Full transparency and openness is extremely important in all matters relating to food.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the revelation in the reports that bovine spinal cord was found in a consignment of meat exported to the North from the South recently. It was reported that investigations are taking place into this matter. Will the Minister outline the investigations taking place into this matter and how such a situation could have arisen? We heard disturbing reports from the UK recently about CJD and bad butchering practices which led to serious incidences in a village there. A full and thorough investigation of this matter should be carried out and people found to be negligent should suffer the consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The claims in <i>The Sunday Times</i> must be fully answered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. While it was a statistical probability study, it is important that these issues are addressed and clarified.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Fitzgerald relating to specified risk material, that spinal cord was attached to carcases which were exported must be fully investigated and those responsible should bear the brunt of the law. This highlights the shabby butchering which is taking place in some plants. This matter must be fully investigated. These are export plants which are supposed to have a higher standard of regulation than ordinary abattoirs. How specified risk material in the form of spinal cord ended up on a carcase which was exported is disgraceful, one which must be thoroughly investigated to ensure this does not happen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>A study carried out for the UK Food Standards Agency has claimed that the risk of eating beef contaminated with BSE is considerably higher in Ireland than in the United Kingdom and that the level of BSE infection in the Irish herd was far greater than the incidence reported. I cannot accept either of these conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has recently received the report and has serious doubts about the findings. They are based on assumptions of the incidence <Col N="1166" /> for which there is no basis. In the area of both the levels of infectivity and the low levels of usage of compound feed, no recognition is given to Ireland's favourable position. This is also the view of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which has expressed misgivings about the assumptions set down in and the conclusions of this report.</P>
    <P>The study singularly fails to take into account the incidence of BSE in this country and the range of strict controls in place at farm level, processing level and in feed manufacture. The compilation of the data for the UK report took place without reference to my Department.</P>
    <P>The range of measures put in place in Ireland ensures that consumers of Irish beef are not subject to unacceptable levels of risk. This has been confirmed by both the EU and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, based on detailed examinations of the systems in place. The EU Scientific Steering Committee classified Ireland as a low incidence country and has deemed the Irish control regime to be optimally stable.</P>
    <P>The numbers of BSE cases in Ireland and the UK are in stark contrast and indicate that the nature of the BSE problems in both countries cannot be compared. The total number of cases in Ireland reported to date is 622 while the number in the UK stands at approximately 180,000. The UK has been categorised as having BSE on an epidemic scale, while Ireland's incidence is accepted as low to sporadic. Ireland is currently operating the EU test or destruct scheme in respect of animals over 30 months. So far, a total of 60,000 over 30 month animals have been rapid-tested for BSE and all have proved negative. The age profile of animals diagnosed with BSE in Ireland in recent years demonstrates that the measures put in place are effective.</P>
    <P>A complaint was received from Northern Ireland concerning the discovery of bovine spinal cord in beef exported to Northern Ireland. The position is that two consignments of bovine quarters were shipped from an export approved premises here to a premises in Larne, Northern Ireland, on 16 and 17 March last. Unloading of the two containers took place on 20 March. The following day it was reported that the meat inspector who supervised the unloading thought he saw some spinal cord in one forequarter, out of a total delivery of 450 quarters. Investigation of this incident was hampered by lack of information from the Northern Ireland side. In particular, they were unable to say which load contained the suspect quarter, nor were they able to provide the carcase number or the piece of spinal cord or evidence that the quarter originated from the premises in the Republic. This latter point is relevant since there appears to have been beef deliveries from other premises in the Ireland company's marshalling area at that time.</P>
    <P>For its part, the plant management in the premises here is adamant that there was no spinal cord in any bone-in quarter consigned to Northern Ireland and that all bone-in beef was personally <Col N="1167" /> checked by a production manager prior to loading.</P>
    <P>I view any non-compliance with prescribed SRM protocol in the gravest light. This incident gave cause for concern because the export approved premises was involved in a previous similar incident. Following that incident, the chief veterinary officer of my Department wrote to plant management warning that, in the event of any further problems, supplementary SRM certification would be withdrawn with immediate effect. Consequently, in view of the later incident, veterinary certification was withdrawn pending full investigation of the complaint. This action has the effect of suspending exports of all beef from the plant destined for the UK market. In light of the current situation, where there is strong UK demand for imported beef, this is the most severe penalty which can be imposed on the plant.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputies accept that is a full and comprehensive reply to the question. I thank them for giving me the opportunity to reply.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister and the Minister for Health and Children that in 1998, amid great fanfare during a by-election in Dublin North, £13 million was announced for the provision of proper facilities for the mentally handicapped in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane. This money was to be used to provide specially designed bungalow accommodation both on the campus of St. Ita's and off campus at a site in Oldtown. The Oldtown facility to accommodate 30 clients has been completed since September 2000 but, to date, no one has been moved from the inadequate facilities in St. Ita's into this new facility.</P>
      <P>There appears to be ongoing negotiations with the staff. I cannot understand why such negotiations could not have been carried out in parallel with the building programme so that now some of the mentally handicapped clients in the hospital could be in the new premises. Progress on the bungalow complex in St. Ita's, alas, is non-existent. Even after three years of the announcement of that money, planning permission has not yet been sought. This accommodation will allow for 60 more people to be moved out of totally unsatisfactory accommodation, unsatisfactory both for the mentally handicapped and the staff who care for them. Even when the 90 places come on stream, there will still be 180 people for whom new accommodation is not planned. Will the Minister give a firm commitment that money will be made available to commence planning and provision for new facilities for the remaining 180 mentally handicapped people in St. Ita's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the February storms, the hospital was without electricity for two full days because of power cuts. The old generator which could have provided a back-up service broke down, leaving the hospital without light, heating or cooking facilities for almost ten hours. It is a scandal in <Col N="1168" /> 2001 that the Minister and his Department cannot ensure the most vulnerable patients in our health system are not left without the most basic of human needs. Staff living locally went home to boil kettles so patients could have a hot cup of tea.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for a commitment to provide a new modern generator to the hospital so that this kind of lack of service will not happen again. The campus of St. Ita's accommodates 280 mentally handicapped people and 230 psychiatric or mentally ill patients, plus 800 staff with a further 150 staff working off campus but attached to the hospital. At Easter 2000, the main kitchen was closed down by the environmental health officer as being unsatisfactory and temporary kitchens were set up. Progress has been extremely slow in providing a new kitchen complex. I was informed today that it will be a further six months before a planning application is lodged. What is happening in the Minister's Department, that everything to do with the provision of updated and modern facilities for the hospital seems to take forever? </P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff in all areas of St. Ita's for their fortitude and delivery of services to the patients despite all the difficulties. I call on the management of the hospital, the health board and the Minister to take every step possible to expedite the planning stages of the work and provide the necessary resources to bring St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin, up to the standard expected in the 21st century. It is a scandal that some of its facilities can be described as Dickensian.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to update the House on the progress being made.</P>
      <P>The provision of alternative and refurbished accommodation for persons with an intellectual disability accommodated in St. Joseph's Services, St. Ita's Hospital, was one of the key elements of the capital programme for services for persons with an intellectual disability announced in 1998 by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. The capital programme which he put in place for these services was subsequently incorporated into, and expanded under, the national development plan for the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>The development plan for St. Joseph's Services includes the provision of new accommodation on St. Ita's campus and the refurbishment of existing residential and day care facilities. It also includes the provision of additional facilities at locations outside the hospital campus. The first of the new facilities to be provided off campus is in Oldtown, County Dublin. It consists of purpose-built residential and day facilities for 30 residents from St. Joseph's Services and is ready of occupation.</P>

      <P>Discussions are being finalised with staff representatives within the services and the Northern Area Health Board expects to be in a position shortly to begin to move clients into the first two bungalows. New residential accommodation consisting of ten bungalows, with new day service facilities for persons with autism, is being provided on the hospital campus. This will enable a further 60 persons accommodated in the main buildings to be relocated.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there are certain procedures which must be followed in bringing a project of this nature on stream. The initial work involves the completion of an assessment of client need and the preparation of a detailed design brief for the project. In this case it also involved the preparation of a development control plan for St. Ita's complex as a whole. This was necessary to ensure the site chosen for the project would not impede any future developments on the campus.</P>
      <P>These procedures have been completed and approval has issued to the authority to proceed to the next stage of development. This involves seeking planning permission for the project and the issuing of tender documents. The Minister has been informed by the Northern Area Health Board that it will shortly submit an application for planning approval to Fingal County Council and that the necessary preparatory work is under way in relation to the advertisement for tenders for the project.</P>
      <P>While the anxiety of families and staff to have the new facilities come on stream as quickly as possible is understandable, there are statutory and other requirements which must be complied with and there are inevitable time factors associated with these processes. The board has initiated a significant programme of refurbishment in relation to the existing accommodation on the campus. It is also actively following up on the other elements of its development plan for the services, including the identification of suitable locations for other projects similar to the Clonmethan complex.</P>
      <P>The provision of both new and refurbished accommodation for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate settings is an integral part of the overall development programme for the services. The Minister has visited the St. Ita's Hospital campus and indicated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health Board the priority he attaches to the developments. It is anticipated that progress can be made quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the matter of basic road safety as a Deputy for Dublin North who, with many others, has grieved with families affected by road tragedies, particularly those which occurred on the M50 and M1, the Santry bypass. The tragedy of a collision between a jeep which veered off a road and hit a train at Selby in England reminded us again of the need for a thorough assessment of safety standards on newly built primary routes, particularly dual carriageways and motorways.</P>
      <P>Having investigated the standards being followed by the National Roads Authority, I have discovered that rather than implementing the EU-sponsored EN 1317 standard adopted by the National Safety Authority the NRA has continued to follow the old British standard specifications which have operated in the United Kingdom for many years. This raises a number of basic issues, safety being the main one. EN 1317 is a five part standard, of which Parts 1 and 2 cover all the design and testing requirements and criteria. Part 3 has been published. The NRA has informed me that Parts 4 and 5 are awaited and that it will not move on implementing EN 1317 until they are published. Meanwhile our EU partners are moving ahead with EN 1317, the most up-to-date and best tested standard to meet the needs of modern society.</P>
      <P>I have not met anyone who can tell me about the certification of testing of the old British standard. I have yet to receive a copy of certification of testing. EN 1317 requires a much more sophisticated barrier system appropriate to collision with either a small vehicle, a one tonne family car or a 40 tonne heavy goods vehicle. We should implement this standard. Given that we will debate the Nice Treaty next week, it is ironic that our EU partners on the Continent are operating an EU standard while we continue to operate a British standard which is both outdated and less satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Accusations have been made that a cartel will operate for tendering of the old British standard. I have only come across two companies which are able to cope with tenders for this standard. Those companies which operate the EN 1317 standard are ruled out of tendering for road contracts. This is a separate matter beyond the issue of safety.</P>
      <P>Given that we receive Cohesion and Structural Funding for the building of highways, it is difficult to understand the reason we do not comply with the standard our EU partners in the main apply to their road building operations. I am worried that we are giving an excuse to those who argue with the Minister for Finance about our use of EU moneys and accuse us of not complying with the general EU standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many have raised with me the scarcity of crash barriers, particularly along central reservations on the M1 and dual carriageways. Without a central reservation crash barrier there is the added danger that a car or other vehicle which loses <Col N="1171" /> control can cross the central reservation and crash with oncoming traffic. This has happened. The Minister should take note of these tragedies and ensure the standards are improved and these issues addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Under section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993, the National Roads Authority has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government appoints the members of the authority and is responsible for the payment of block grants to the authority and for certain broad policy matters. Non-national roads are the responsibility of road authorities.</P>
      <P>Under section 19(1)(<i>g</i>) of the Roads Act, 1993, the NRA may specify standards in relation to construction or maintenance works on national roads, with the approval of the Minister. This task is being addressed by the NRA on two fronts. The NRA document, Specifications for Road Works, outlines the specification which should apply to various materials, including crash barriers used in national road construction. The other main aspect of road standard specification relates to the design of roads and bridges. This includes consideration of location, geometrics and the provision of signage and delineation. A study of the design options for major road projects carried out for the NRA in the 1996-98 period recommended that the standards of the UK highways Agency Design Manual for Roads and Bridges be adopted for national roads and that the existing national road guidelines &ndash; RT 180 and RT 181 &ndash; should be replaced with a simple condensed design guideline. Consultants were subsequently appointed to prepare the NRA Design Manual for Roads and Bridges and the NRA Road Geometry Handbook, which, <i>inter alia</i>, address the use and positioning of crash barriers. These documents have now been submitted by the NRA for my approval, as required under the Roads Act, 1993, and are being considered in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of EU harmonised product standard for crash barriers is an involved procedure and a number of essential elements of the formal process have still to be completed. Formal adoption and implementation of the standard is a six part process. Parts 1, 2 and 3 have been published to date, while parts 4, 5 and 6 are at various stages of preparation. As all parts of EN 1317 are not yet available, I understand that the NRA is in the process of drafting a revised standard that will incorporate all the published elements of EN 1317. These relate particularly to design performance classes and impact test acceptance criteria. Pending completion of this exercise, the NRA considers it necessary to specify standards in terms of the Design Manual for Roads and <Col N="1172" /> Bridges and also to accept equivalent product standards from another member state.</P>
    <P>In relation to a related point raised by the Deputy, if he has evidence of a cartel operating in this particular area and brings the details to my attention I would be pleased to pursue it on his behalf. l hope this clarifies the position and I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the new US Administration that that country would unilaterally renounce its obligations under the Kyoto climate change treaty represent a fundamental challenge to us all. It seems clear that the new US President has little regard for what his father once termed the new world order. There is no place for isolationism in a global world. The United States like all other countries will be forced to deal with the implications around global warming. As the largest contributor to that problem their obligation to tackle the problem is greater than others. I have no doubt that these are some of the points Chancellor Shröeder will be putting to the President when he meets him today.</P>
      <P>The position adopted by the US delegation at last year's Hague conference on climate change which the President attended was in my view inadequate and led directly to the breakdown. That it has deteriorated further is deeply depressing. At the heart of the US decision is a fundamental contradiction. It is born of isolationism and the short-term commercial needs of those who backed the American Republican Party. At the same time it portrays an Administration that will be belligerent and aggressive in the conduct of its foreign policy. It displays too a worrying anti-intellectualism recently expressed here by former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, giving credence to the dangerous view that climate change is not happening and that it does not pose a significant threat to us. This is a message that Ireland must bring to the new US Administration through our membership of the United Nations Security Council. That honour, as well as the access enjoyed to the White House by the Taoiseach and others recently, also conveys special obligations on us to make our voice heard.</P>
      <P>Ireland should unreservedly condemn the US decision. Regrets are not enough. No doubt the Minister for Foreign Affairs would feel more comfortable expressing our views if our own record on this issue was more distinguished. The reality is that we have failed to put in place sufficient measures to fulfil our obligations under the Kyoto Agreement. Just as this Government's policy of the economy first and society second has had implications for family life through the policy of individualisation, so too has it confined and constrained action on the environment. Deputy Gormley is right on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the first generation to have the responsibility of looking after the future of our <Col N="1173" /> planet as well as our children. We are the first generation to know that what we do now will seriously impact on how people live their lives in the future. It is a special responsibility and one I am particularly aware of as a parent. The decision by the United States is a threat to the quality of life of all our children. It is a mistake of massive proportions. It is short-termist beyond belief and it represents a threat to us all. It was not endorsed by the US people at the recent election and it must be challenged.</P>
    <P>I made one point in a contribution to the House earlier today. Commentator after commentator portrayed the battle between Al Gore and George W. Bush as one without issues and without ideology. It was not true on tax and it certainly is not true on the environment. But it is an easy line for some in the media to portray. The fact is that there remain significant ideological and policy differences not just in US politics but also in this House. It is my belief that those differences on issues like tax and spending are good for politics and good for democracy but it is certainly neither good for democracy nor for the future of our fragile environment when a country as powerful and influential as the United States unilaterally decides to renege on such an important treaty and the Kyoto Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for giving me the opportunity to make a statement to the House on this important issue. I agree with a lot of what he said but there are parts of it I would disagree with in relation to our own performance.</P>
      <P>The United States, along with the EU, was a full party to the international climate negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol and is a signatory to the Protocol. Both the EU and US tried hard to reach agreement last November in The Hague on the most economically efficient and environmentally secure means of implementing the Protocol. We have been aware for some time that the new US Administration has concerns in relation to its implementation, both in domestic terms and in relation to the lack of targets for developing countries. We understand that a thorough review of climate change policy is now under way in the US Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On entering office, the new US Administration quickly sought to postpone the resumption of climate change negotiations scheduled for next May. The EU reluctantly agreed to a deferral to July in recognition of the need for positive US involvement after that policy review. All member states wanted to create the right conditions for ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol by 2002. Unfortunately, since November the EU continued to signal its own position in clear terms to the US and the US seemed to be consistently retreating from its commitment to Kyoto. We have emphasised again and again our commitment to reach an agreement at the resumed COP 6 on the basis of the Kyoto Protocol. We have made it clear that the protocol is the outcome of many years of negotiation and that it <Col N="1174" /> offers an effective framework for global action to reduce emissions and an opportunity to modernise economies.</P>
    <P>Recent international scientific advice makes it clear that human activity is accelerating climate change and that the consequences will be more severe and extensive than previously expected. The clear scientific evidence is that climate change is real, is happening now, and will get worse. Despite what the spokesperson for the US Administration might try to claim, there is little doubt in the scientific community that it is with us, is accelerating and will have serious consequences.</P>
    <P>It is with deep regret that I learnt of the apparent decision that the US will no longer pursue the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. I have issued a press statement highlighting that concern. I will be meeting my Environment ministerial colleagues this weekend at the EU Environment Council meeting and I have no doubt we will spend some time assessing what the decision means for the world community and what actions are necessary to ensure the protocol remains the firm basis for future negotiations and actions to reduce emissions.</P>
    <P>Emissions from the developed world are the primary contribution to global climate change and, as Deputy Quinn said, the US leads the way on that, unfortunately. Developed countries must take the first meaningful steps to reduce them. The EU is determined to achieve our targeted 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels over this decade. This target is more onerous than the 7% target agreed by the US.</P>
    <P>I understand the US says it intends to continue working with friends and allies on means to address global climate change. This has to inform the final outcome of the US review currently under way and its contribution to the resumed Kyoto negotiations. I am not clear as to how one can withdraw from the protocol and then talk in terms of working with one's allies and friends to address global climate change. I am sure it will be clarified for us at some stage.</P>
    <P>I am writing to the US Ambassador outlining my concerns and will work to ensure that the concerns of the Irish Government and of the EU are fully understood at the highest levels of the US Administration. When the European Council met recently in Stockholm, the EU's strong commitment to the protocol was reaffirmed and all negotiating partners were urged to engage constructively in seeking its full implementation.</P>
    <P>For my part, I remain firmly wedded to the need for this country to meet our obligations and to the implementation of the Government's National Climate Change Strategy which I published last November. I look forward to the full support of the Labour Party when the difficult decisions entailed in it are put before the people. I sincerely hope Deputy Quinn's sincerity in trying to reach targets, as expressed in the House, <Col N="1175" /> will be backed fully by his party when difficult decisions have to be made in relation to energy taxes, waste management charges and so on.</P>
    <P>I will do everything possible with my EU colleagues to ensure that the US realises the seriousness with which we view its statements. I am not sure if the House is aware that the Taoiseach was the first EU leader to meet with President Bush <Col N="1176" /> and this matter was raised by the Taoiseach on behalf of the EU. I take Deputy Quinn's suggestion in relation to using our position in the UN to further strengthen the Irish position and to make it clear to the US Administration.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the need to establish a single veterinary inspection regime here in the context of the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a single veterinary regime for the island of Ireland would require agreement between the Government and that of the United Kingdom and the Northern Ireland Assembly. A considerable amount of work has already taken place, under the aegis of the North-South Ministerial Council, to seek possibilities for collaboration and co-operation in a range of animal health areas and this will continue.</P>
      <P>In the context of the present foot and mouth situation there are potential advantages to a common veterinary regime, assuming that it would be possible to ensure that controls equivalent to those operating between this jurisdiction and Great Britain, the Netherlands and France, were also operating between Northern Ireland and those countries.</P>
      <P>This question is extremely complex. Any decision to establish a single veterinary regime on this island would require both parts of it to have equivalent animal health status. There is a very considerable amount of equivalence. The situation is complicated by the fact that the high incidence of BSE in the UK herd has meant that the exportation of livestock from Northern Ireland has been banned since 1996. There is also an over 30 month regime operating in the UK where such bovine animals are excluded from the food chain. Therefore, there are some obstacles to the establishment of a single veterinary regime on this island.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that there has been an excellent degree of co-operation between ourselves and Northern Ireland on animal health issues. I will continue to focus on developing this relationship both at ministerial and official level. That co-operation is especially important in our efforts to eliminate foot and mouth disease from Ireland.</P>

      <P>The special purchase scheme will come into effect in mid-April and will remain in place until the end of the year. Member states which do not implement the purchase for destruction scheme will be obliged to implement the special purchase scheme from mid-April while member states who already implement the destruction scheme may implement both schemes until 30 June. The special purchase scheme will become compulsory in all member states from 1 July.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the scheme will be taken up by all member states. The special purchase scheme is different from the destruction scheme in that it removes the obligation on member states to destroy the beef, which may be used for food aid or as free food to the deprived people in the country. This option should help to remove one of the obstacles to the implementation of the scheme in some member states.</P>
      <P>The special purchase scheme will provide considerable support to the beef market, particularly in the second half of the year. The trigger prices fixed for Ireland are relatively high and allows the EU Commission to support prices at reasonable levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely con<Col N="1179" /> cerned about the foot and mouth situation in Great Britain. The number of cases now exceeds 700 and continues to rise. The disease has spread rapidly there and a comparison with its spread in 1967 shows that the disease has already covered a much larger area than in 1967, when outbreaks were confined to the north Wales border area and to adjoining counties.</P>
      <P>The problem there has deteriorated to the extent that the UK yesterday received permission from the European Commission to engage in a limited vaccination programme for cattle. Its intention is to vaccinate cattle in parts of Devon and Cumbria while continuing with the culling of sheep. Many of these cattle would have been housed over the winter period. While the vaccination of cattle in the United Kingdom is not of significance in so far as exports are concerned, given its pre-existing BSE related export ban, this would not be the case were such a policy to be adopted in Ireland given our reliance on export outlets. Nevertheless, this move by the UK is a clear indicator of the gravity of the situation there.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the situation in Great Britain will continue to be a dangerous overhang for some considerable time after this island is once again free of foot and mouth disease. For so long as this is the case, we will need to maintain a state of alert and to ensure that measures to prevent the spread of the disease are implemented with the same degree of vigour with which they have been up to now. In this regard the expert committee which I have established under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan, the dean of the faculty of veterinary medicine in UCD, will continue to evaluate the controls in place on the basis of an analysis of the risks, and to make recommendations in relation to any adjustments which might be required in the light of prevailing circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Rice farm at Jenkinstown, County Louth had been inspected on Friday, 16 March 2001, and was found to be clear of the symptoms of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday afternoon, 20 March 2001, a veterinary inspector visited the farm again and became <Col N="1180" /> suspicious of some signs of foot and mouth being present in sheep. Later that evening samples were taken and they were sent for examination the following morning. Later that night the suspected animals were slaughtered.</P>
    <P>Test results from Pirbright Reference Laboratory in the UK were received on the morning of Thursday, 22 March and they confirmed two results as positive thereby confirming foot and mouth in the flock. The sheep were buried <i>in situ</i> on that day.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the animals on the farm, which comprises seven holdings, was slaughtered and all of the animals were disposed of by Friday afternoon, 23 March.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that swift action was taken following the identification of suspect symptoms, that the necessary precautions were put in place and sound procedures were followed.</P>

Once the animals are dead they no longer breathe virus.</P>
      <P>They are then disinfected, loaded on a leak proof vehicle which is covered tightly with a tarpaulin, sent for rendering in the nearest available rendering plant and ultimately for incineration. The rendering plant in question is, for the present, dedicated to this function; stringent disinfection procedures, involving the carcasses, vehicles and the slaughter and rendering plants are followed at all stages of the process. I am satisfied that every precaution is being taken and that the procedure in place is the best available, both in terms of preventing the spread of the disease and in terms of ensuring that farmers whose holdings are affected are not subjected to the trauma of seeing their animals destroyed on farm.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the procedures in relation to the diagnosis in bovine animals of TB, brucellosis and BSE, as outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 151 on 5 December 2000.</P>
      <P>Such procedures in the case of TB and brucellosis involve slaughter at an approved export plant and detailed veterinary investigation. Entry of each and every reactor into the human food chain is determined by the results of full ante and post-mortem inspections.</P>
      <P>The procedure in the case of BSE involves the visit to a suspect case of both a veterinary inspector and a veterinary research officer from my Department and the euthanising of the suspect animal. This is followed by laboratory analysis of a sample of the brain tissue taken from the animal in question, freezing and retention for disposal of the remainder of the carcass and restriction of the remainder of the herd. If BSE is confirmed the entire herd is then valued and slaughtered in a designated plant with compensation being paid to the herdowner. The carcasses are then rendered at a specified rendering plant. In all cases the progeny and the birth cohorts of the affected animal are traced, purchased at market value, slaughtered, destroyed and rendered in the same manner as depopulated herds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following detailed screening procedures 46 of the applicants have been placed on a panel set up <Col N="1182" /> for this scheme. None of those placed on the current panel are cattle traders or factory agents but it does include a number of farmers.</P>

      <P>Classification of beef carcasses is carried out by officials of my Department in accordance with a standard EU system, using criteria laid down in Council and Commission regulations. Classification is based on a visual examination of the dressed carcass and its characteristics.</P>
      <P>The relevant EU Regulations, as well as Statutory Instrument No. 8 of 1994 which transposes these Regulations into national law, provide for the conformation, fat cover and category of a carcass to be determined by a classification officer by examining the carcass within one hour of slaughter of the bovine animal concerned.</P>
      <P>Any producer who is not satisfied with the decision of the classification officer may lodge an appeal while the carcass is still intact on the premises.</P>
      <P>Since the cattle movement monitoring system does not include a record of all calvings it cannot be used to establish the category of a female bovine. The CMMS provides a record of calving where the calf is born alive and survives to registration time. As the incidence of peri-natal mortality for calves born from first calving bovines can be up to 8%, a significant number of once calved cows would continue to be identified as heifers within the CMMS system.</P>

      <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a review of the poverty targets in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy is being undertaken by the various Departments involved. My Department is responsible for reviewing the rural poverty theme and is establishing a working group to address the key issues within this theme in as comprehensive a way as possible.</P>
      <P>Last month relevant Departments, local development agencies, the social partners and the community and voluntary sector were invited by my Department to nominate representatives to the working group. Most of these have responded but due to restrictions imposed by the foot and mouth disease some organisations have had difficulty in meeting to finalise their nominations.</P>
      <P>A position paper is being prepared by my Department to facilitate the business of the group. This will be circulated to members in advance of the group's first meeting which is planned to be held before Easter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the present foot and mouth disease controls involving restrictions on the movement of animals, the European Commission has agreed a derogation to the EU regulation which sets down the requirements for set-aside land under the arable aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The derogation provides that up to 30 April 2001 producers who have set land aside for the purposes of the 2001 arable aid scheme may, in justified cases and subject to certain conditions, use that set-aside land for the grazing of their own animals. Of course the safeguards and restrictions on movement of animals put in place <Col N="1184" /> by my Department in relation to the foot and mouth disease will apply. I have advised farmers to contact their local district veterinary office in any case of doubt.</P>
    <P>Approval to avail of this temporary measure can be obtained from my Department by making a written application to the area aid unit setting out the specific reasons that would justify the grazing of set-aside land in the period concerned. The producer must give an undertaking that only his-her animals will be allowed to graze the set-aside land and that those animals will be removed from the set-aside land no later than the 30 April deadline.</P>
    <P>I have also announced arrangements to permit tillage farmers within the ten kilometre surveillance-exclusion zones in County Louth who are participants in the arable area aid system to put up to 100% of their land into set-aside this year.</P>
    <P>This derogation from the voluntary set-aside limit of 30%, which applies to the rest of the country, is being permitted to facilitate farmers who are unable to sow their crops because of movement restrictions on machinery and inputs within the zones arising from the foot and mouth situation. It will ensure that farmers who cannot claim area aid on sown areas will instead be able to receive payments for land which is left fallow and thus will not lose out.</P>

I have already raised this matter at the EU Council of Ministers and will <Col N="1185" /> continue to address this issue at European level in the coming weeks to establish the Commission's intentions in this regard.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan, the food industry has been given an indicative public funding allocation of £282 million for the period 2000-06. This funding will be used to finance the following four measures: capital investment, £120 million; research and development, £83 million; promotion and market development, £48 million; and human resources, £31 million.</P>
      <P>These measures, which will be administered, as appropriate, by my Department, An Bord Bia and the Industrial Development Agencies, represent a comprehensive response to the development needs of the industry as identified by the food industry development group and the AgriFood 2010 Committee. In particular, they are aimed at enhancing the industry's competitiveness and innovative capability while at the same time helping to ensure that development is underpinned by attention to food safety and quality issues. The measures will also assist the industry in addressing problems resulting from the foot and mouth outbreak.</P>
      <P>I had planned that the measures would be formally launched within a few weeks. However, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, because of the foot and mouth outbreak and the fact that the proposed launch would involve bringing together a significant number of persons from the high risk agribusiness sector, I have decided to postpone it for the time being. Meanwhile, all the main elements of the measures have been brought into operation.</P>

      <P>The question of carrying out farm visits has been considered along with the other foot and mouth restrictions by an expert group under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD. The advice of this <Col N="1186" /> group to date remains that visits to farms continue to be a high risk activity and that, for the present, only visits deemed to be absolutely necessary should take place. On the basis of this advice, it is not proposed to carry out any farm visits either to inspect completed works or to process new applications for grant aid for on-farm investments. In this context, it is also considered inappropriate to approve works to proceed on farms which would involve the entry of contractors, builders etc. on to the farms. However, the position is being kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>There is not at this stage any EU Commission proposal to introduce a fixed ewe premium. This suggestion was, however, included in a consultant's report to the Commission as one of a number of possible amendments to the EU sheepmeat regime. The Commission's response to this report in the form of formal proposals is still awaited, although it is expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a fixed premium has some advantages over a variable premium, particularly in that it provides a greater degree of certainty to producers about the level of the premium, it does have the significant disadvantage that, unlike a <Col N="1187" /> variable premium, it is not increased when prices fall. In view of this, in the event that the Commission comes forward with a proposal for a fixed premium, I will be seeking to have the premium fixed at a significantly higher level than that which has obtained in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The task of recovering export markets for Irish beef is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product. Since the onset of the current BSE crisis late last year, my Department has been in contact with all of our traditionally important markets to emphasise to them the level of BSE controls in place in Ireland and to point out the assurances we can offer in relation to the safety of Irish beef. An Bord Bia and our embassies abroad contribute on an ongoing basis to this effort.</P>
      <P>With regard to Egypt, which is one of our most important third country markets, I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Cairo last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Senior officials of my Department returned to Egypt earlier this year to continue discussions on a technical level. With regard to Saudi Arabia, a senior official of my Department travelled to Riyadh earlier this year to brief the Saudi authorities on the BSE situation and the level of controls in place in Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, in many of our non-EU markets the situation is exacerbated by sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on the BSE developments in those countries which have recently encountered their first cases. Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that every effort, both directly and through diplomatic channels, is being made to re-open markets to Irish beef. It is, however, clear that a restoration of exports is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1999, the EU Commission validated three rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of BSE. Each member state was free to choose one or more of these three tests to conduct active surveillance in its territory. In Ireland, as in Denmark, a test developed by the company referred to has been used for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Each of the tests validated by the Commission proved extremely accurate in identifying the infective agent in samples from diseased animals in the course of the Commission's validation exercise. All three validated tests have also detected BSE in some pre-clinical animals.</P>
      <P>However, none can be taken as providing an absolute guarantee that BSE is not in the very early stages of incubation in tested animals, although to date none of the BSE cases detected in Ireland have been in animals born since the enhanced controls adopted in 1996 and 1997 began to take effect. The rapid tests, therefore, should be seen as a very valuable addition to the existing range of BSE measures that remain in place. In this context, it is undoubtedly reassuring that more than 60,000 animals over 30 months of age intended for human consumption have been tested since 2 January 2001, all with negative results.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to introduce a comprehensive national identification system for sheep, involving the individual identification of all sheep by tagging, from next May, and my Department is working towards this objective. In the course of advancing this work, discussions on the details of the system have been held with the various relevant representative organisations.</P>
      <P>Under the system, sheep will be tagged and details of all sheep on farms and of all sheep movements will be fully recorded. Processors will be required to link the individual sheep tag number to the number of the finished carcass. Ireland will thus, for the first time, have full traceability for all sheep, on an individual animal basis. This will be of significant benefit, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum which reported in October 1999.</P>
      <P>I have consistently stated that I attach great importance to ensuring that this particular project is completed by May. Deficiencies in this area are no longer acceptable and I expect the co-operation of all concerned in ensuring that the full traceability system, based on tagging and encompassing producers, marts, processors and others can be put in place within this time scale.</P>

      <P>One of the results of the negotiation of the Agenda 2000 package was an increase of 2.86% in our national milk quota amounting to 32 million gallons. Already 20.5 million gallons has been allocated, 15 million gallons being allocated to 21,600 producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons and a further five million gallons to 3,100 younger dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons. I set aside 500,000 gallons for distribution by the milk quota appeals tribunal to special exceptional cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of 11.5 million gallons will be available from 1 April this year. Because of the major disruption to normal farming practices which has followed from the foot and mouth crisis, I have decided that special arrangements <Col N="1190" /> need to be put in place to deal with quota problems which will arise for individual producers.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I have announced a number of measures designed to alleviate those difficulties. As part of those measures, I have decided that the 11.5 million gallons should not be allocated definitively from 1 April but should be allocated on a temporary basis in the quota year 2001-02 in order to deal with those cases where serious quota difficulties will arise. Such difficulties will be encountered by many producers who will not be able to dispose of cows or heifers because of the ban on sales and will, therefore, have additional milk production well in excess of their normal output and could be faced with serious superlevy penalties. The allocation on a temporary basis of some or all of the 11.5 million gallons, in conjunction with other measures I have announced, will go some of the way to relieve this potentially serious problem. When matters are restored to normal later in the year I will decide on the permanent allocation of the additional quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I received the submission to which the Deputy refers and it is being examined within my Department. The situation generally with regard to abattoirs is that, under EU regulations, those slaughtering more than 1,000 livestock units per annum must comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small abattoirs with a throughput of less than 1,000 livestock units per annum are derogated from certain requirements of these regulations provided they are licensed and operated in accordance with the requirements of the Abattoirs Act, 1988. These small abattoirs are, however, required to achieve minimum standards regarding hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. Once licensed by my Department, the operation of day-to-day controls is a matter for <Col N="1191" /> the relevant local authority under the overall control of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. I fully acknowledge the important role played by domestic abattoirs within the wider food sector and this has been reflected in the approach taken by my Department to establishments that have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the regulations. However, given the absolute primacy of consumer protection, my Department cannot provide licenses to those premises which are not prepared to achieve the minimum standard required.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of financial aid, abattoirs fall within the ambit of the processing and marketing provisions of the EU guidelines for state aid in the agricultural sector. One such provision stipulates that aid may only be granted to enterprises that comply with existing minimum standards. Therefore, while it is not possible, nor would it be appropriate, to provide funding to achieve minimum hygiene standards, possibilities do exist for financial aid in circumstances which involve rationalisation, research and development, human resources, training and so on. The Department participated in a number of meetings last year with the associated craft butchers of Ireland during which these possibilities were discussed. The association was invited to submit proposals for financial assistance in line with these criteria, but no proposals were received.</P>

      <P>The Organic Development Committee met on 27 November 2000 and again on 23 January 2001. At its first meeting, the committee established three sub-groups. These sub-groups were asked to examine specific issues and report to the main committee. The committee also placed advertisements in the national newspapers inviting submissions on the matters that had been referred to the sub-groups. A considerable number of submissions were received as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its second meeting in January, the main committee heard progress reports from the three sub-groups, and had an extensive discussion about the constraints affecting the development of the organic sector in Ireland. One of the sub-groups has been asked to consider points of difference between the standards for organic livestock provided for in EU regulation and those recommended by the three Irish organic farming bodies. The second group has the widest remit. It will report on where market intelligence can be obtained and how it should be used, on the establishment of an effective quality assurance system, and on opportunities for improved marketing and promotion. It will also recommend a national label that will be available to all Irish organic producers and processors. The third sub-group has been asked to identify priorities in the areas of research, advice, training and education that would enhance the scope for development of the Irish organic sector, and to recommend what <Col N="1193" /> actions the State and the private sector respectively should take.</P>
    <P>The three sub-groups have each had a number of meetings and have made substantial progress. I am encouraged by the energy and commitment that have been shown by all the participants both in the sub-groups and in the work of the main organic development committee.</P>
    <P>I had asked the committee to report to me by the end of April. This target date has had to be reconsidered because the foot and mouth emergency has made it necessary to postpone a number of meetings, and as a result I have asked my Department to consider what other arrangements can be made to bring the committee's work to completion as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Following confirmation of FMD on a farm at Proleek on the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth, a range of measures was immediately put in place to contain the disease, so as to prevent its spread elsewhere in the State, and to meet EU trading requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the following specific actions were taken: a three kilometre control zone and a ten kilometre surveillance zone were established around the affected farm; Garda resources, which had been deployed in anticipation of confirmation of the case, were strengthened and additional departmental and other resources were assigned to the perimeters of both zones; the Louth borders with other counties were sealed off by the security forces to protect the regionalisation approach secured by Ireland in the Commission decision following the outbreak in County Louth; and intensive investigations were initiated by both the Garda and departmental officials into the source of the outbreak at Proleek; a cull of susceptible animals was undertaken on the following basis: all animals within the one kilometre zone around the index foot and mouth case at Proleek, all sheep flocks within the three kilometre zone, all sheep in a number of associated and contiguous farms linked to the zone, animals in a double contiguous ring to the balance of outfarms further down the peninsula, individual <Col N="1194" /> holdings where there was some link or risk of association with the index case and flocks associated with the use of the mountain commonages adjacent to the three kilometre zone. Associated goat and escaped deer in the latter area will also be removed.</P>
    <P>Work has begun on the cull of sheep on farms between Meigh, County Armagh, and Proleek, County Louth, where the two outbreaks of foot and mouth disease have been confirmed. The joint operation, involving staff from both my Department and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, will create a sterile corridor between the two farms which lie on different sides of the Border. The joint initiative taken with the Northern authorities was for the purpose of eradicating any virus which may be present in the sheep populations in the areas where the two outbreaks occurred. A decision in relation to the wider Cooley Peninsula will be taken on the basis of the outcome of the epidemiological and other investigations now under way. Structured arrangements have been put in place to keep farmers fully informed of developments. In addition, I have arranged that departmental and Teagasc personnel will visit farmers directly involved in depopulations over the coming days.</P>
    <P>Trace-back of sheep, which were suspected of having been brought into the State prior to 21 February when the import ban was imposed, has been vigorously pursued and flocks and herds were slaughtered out in Counties Meath, Laois, Carlow and Wexford over recent days. No clinical symptoms were evident but final results of tests on samples are awaited. There is no evidence of any susceptible animals having been imported into the State from the UK since the import ban. Intensive follow-up of other flocks and herds is continuing. This has been a feature of my Department's approach ever since the ban on imports of susceptible animals and certain animal products from the UK, including Northern Ireland, was first imposed on 21 February.</P>
    <P>The expert committee reconvened and broadly endorsed its earlier recommendations for some relaxation of restrictions in respect of various events. Its latest report has modified its earlier position in respect of advice to travellers from the UK and other infected areas. The committee will continue its review of controls and advice on an ongoing basis. Various meetings have taken place between departmental personnel and other bodies to define protocols, offer advice etc. on a variety of activities. The inter-departmental task force continues to meet, usually on a daily basis, to evaluate the unfolding situation and co-ordinate actions across a spectrum of social and economic interest areas. The Department continues to operate telephone helplines and to ensure, through its website and the media, that information and advice to the public and particular sectors is continued at a high level.</P>
    <P>I believe that the measures in place in County Louth and throughout Ireland generally are appropriate to the circumstances, both in terms <Col N="1195" /> of effectiveness and adherence to EU regulations which in many respects are exceeded. I have, from the very outset, made it clear however that as matters unfold any additional actions which might be deemed necessary to prevent the spread of FMD will be taken.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we recognise that we are still a considerable way from the point at which we can in any sense feel relaxed about FMD. Vigilance and strict adherence with all controls and precautionary advice will be essential for some considerable time to come.</P>

      <P>The question of carrying out farm visits has been considered along with the other foot and mouth restrictions by an expert group under the Chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD. The advice of this group to date remains that visits to farms continue to be a high risk activity and that, for the present, only visits deemed to be absolutely necessary should take place. On the basis of this advice it is not proposed to carry out any farm <Col N="1196" /> visits either to inspect completed works or to process new applications for grant aid for on-farm investments. In this context, it is also considered inappropriate to approve works to proceed on farms which would involve the entry of contractors, builders etc. on to the farms. However, the position is being kept under continuous review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>FMD is one of the most contagious animal diseases. Infected animals excrete virus in the fluid from ruptured blisters, exhaled air, saliva, milk, semen, faeces and urine. Virus transmission can occur from ten days before the appearance of blisters. The primary method of virus transmission is by direct contact or via respiratory particles and droplets. Pigs are potent excretors of virus which has the potential to become airborne. Spread of infection between premises and areas is frequently due to movement between premises and areas of infected animals or contaminated vehicles, equipment, people and animal products, including milk.</P>
      <P>While windborne spread of infected aerosols can occur under favourable conditions, it is unlikely that it was the source of the spread of foot and mouth from Great Britain to the island of Ireland. I am not aware of any confirmation that the disease has been spread in England and Wales by means of this mechanism.</P>

      <P>I set up the AgriFood 2010 Committee in 1999 to provide advice on the future of the agrifood sector. In response to its report, the Government published the AgriFood 2010 plan of action in August 2000. Farm numbers have been in decline in Ireland for a very long time and this is an international phenomenon. In this context, the committee's report projected a further decline in farm numbers over the next 15 years. However, these figures were tentative and conditional estimates and most definitely not targets to be aimed for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> The Government is fully committed to the development of a core of full-time farms earning viable returns on both capital and labour. This point has been set out quite clearly in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and in the AgriFood 2010 plan of action. The Government's objective of ensuring the highest possible number of full-time farms will be facilitated by the wide range of supports received by these farms, the benefits of Agenda 2000 and the measures in the AgriFood 2010 plan of action itself. At the same time, our growing economy offers attractive off-farm job opportunities and this provides an additional route to household viability for many families on smaller farms.</P>
    <P>Therefore the number of full-time and part-time farms in the future will be dependent on the decisions made by farm families themselves. The Government's aim is to actively support farm families in whatever decisions they make about their future.</P>

These range from payments to farmers on, for example, headage and REPS, to rural infrastructure, capital investment in the food sector and rural enterprises.

      <Quest>the number of farmers expected to join the new REP scheme; the studies which have been carried out to assess and quantify the benefits to the environment arising from farmer participation in the REP scheme, specifically through following a prescribed farm nutrient plan and the control of on-farm pollution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The projected level of <Col N="1199" /> participation in REPS by the end of 2006 is 70,000. Participation in the existing scheme stands at 45,500. I am hopeful that the great majority of these farmers will continue their participation in REPS under the new scheme, and I expect that first-time entrants will bring the total to the level that I have indicated by 2006. A financial provision in excess of £1.6 billion has been made for REPS over that period.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive evaluation of REPS was submitted to the European Commission in July 1999. This evaluation assessed how the objectives of the scheme had been met. It examined the agricultural, socio-economic and environmental impact of REPS, and it made practical recommendations for future modifications and improvements. Independent consultants were engaged for this exercise to consider the various inputs to the evaluation process and to put together a comprehensive and objective assessment. Submissions were received from concerned organisations, including the Heritage Council, BirdWatch Ireland, Teagasc and the farming organisations. Independent studies were also commissioned on particular measures of the REP scheme under the auspices of Teagasc and the universities.</P>
      <P>Participants in REPS are required to follow a nutrient management plan which is drawn up for each farm. The plan identifies pollution control facilities on the farm, it ensures the efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner, and it sets limits on application rates of fertilisers. The 1999 evaluation report found that nutrient management plans are contributing significantly to the REP scheme objective of reducing agriculture's contribution to environmental problems.</P>
      <P>The control of farm pollution scheme was specifically examined by the independent analysis and evaluation unit which was set up under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99 &ndash; OPARDF. The examination took place as part of an evaluation of the environmental effects of the OPARDF, which was completed in August 1999. The evaluation found that the management of waste and pollution control facilities was of the utmost importance in preventing pollution and, as a consequence, in protecting the environment.</P>
      <P>On 1 February, I launched the new scheme of investment aid for farm waste management, which is provided for in the national development plan. Under this new scheme, farmers will be eligible for grant aid of up to 40% on a maximum investment of £40,000, and it provides for additional assistance for younger farmers. Mobile slurry equipment is eligible for grant aid and this will allow farmers optimum flexibility in relation to the landspreading of farm wastes.</P>

      <P>Given the unprecedented scale of the crisis in the beef sector arising from a sharp fall in consumption and the closure of many third country markets because of the BSE situation in the EU, measures are needed to restore balance to the market both in the short and medium term. For the measures to be acceptable to me, they must be effective in terms of reducing beef production, they must be properly targeted and they must be equitable as between member states.</P>
      <P>The Commission proposals have serious shortcomings in this regard and of particular concern is the proposal on suckler cows which unfairly targets that sector to reduce beef production. This could have a disproportionate impact on Ireland and I will be seeking to have the balance redressed in the negotiations in the Agriculture Council. I believe that it is possible to devise more effective supply control measures and I have suggested that a calf processing scheme or an early marketing premium as an option. The proposals on the special beef premium are also a cause of concern.</P>
      <P>There have been preliminary discussions in the Council on these proposals but I do not expect substantive negotiations to take place until the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on the proposals in May. Apart from the proposals on intervention which, if adopted, will come into effect this year, the measures will not come into effect until 1 January 2002.</P>

      <P>The special purchase scheme will come into effect in mid-April and will remain in place until the end of the year. Member states which do not implement the purchase for destruction scheme will be obliged to implement the special purchase scheme from mid-April while member states who already implement the destruction scheme may implement both schemes until 30 June. The special purchase scheme will become compulsory in all member states from 1 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident the scheme will be taken up by all member states. The special purchase scheme is different from the destruction scheme in that it removes the obligation on member states to destroy the beef, which may be used for food aid <Col N="1201" /> or as free food to the deprived people in the country. This option should help to remove one of the obstacles to the implementation of the scheme in some member states.</P>
    <P>The special purchase scheme will provide considerable support to the beef market, particularly in the second half of the year. The trigger prices fixed for Ireland are relatively high and allow the EU Commission to support prices at reasonable levels.</P>

      <P>Arising from discussions at Government level some weeks ago, in the context of precautionary measures deemed necessary against foot and mouth disease, FMD, Ministers, Departments and agencies were advised to cancel non-essential events involving the bringing of people together from farming communities or from infected areas and-or to urge people from rural communities not to attend. If such events were to proceed, disinfectant procedures are to be used. Ministers were also asked to have regard to this advice in relation to their own engagements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the House will be <Col N="1202" /> aware that I have kept the measures against FMD under continual review. In this task I have been assisted by the Expert Group on Foot and Mouth Disease Controls which I established on 9 March. The group considers the range of FMD controls in place, advises on their adaptation and supplementation in the light of developments.</P>
    <P>The group has categorised events etc. from a risk assessment viewpoint on the basis of its agreed risk methodology. Essentially, activities are classified into three categories ranging from low-medium risk to high risk. Details have been well publicised. In this context, I have this week accepted suggested revisions to the recommendations in relation to travel to and from the UK and other infected areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I assure the House that the expert group will continue to review and revise where appropriate its recommendations. In that task, it will continue to take as its priority the containment of the disease.</P>

      <P>To date the only published information on total farm household income has been drawn from the CSO Household Budget Survey. The most recent HBS for which results have been published is 1994-95. I understand that results for 1999-2000 should be published later this year.</P>

      <P>The 2001 TB and brucellosis round of herd testing was originally scheduled to commence on 5 March. However, because of the foot and mouth disease crisis it was deemed prudent to defer commencement of the programme. This situation is being kept under ongoing review and a revised commencement date for the new round will be announced in due course in the light of advice given to me by the foot and mouth advisory expert group.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, essential testing of herds, for example, reactor retesting, contiguous testing particularly for brucellosis, backward and forward tracing, factory lesion testing etc. is continuing.</P>
      <P>Private testing of animals, for sale purposes, requires the permission of the district veterinary office, DVO, and the rules in this regard have not changed. Where a herd test has been scheduled by the DVO permission for a private test of only some animals in the herd is refused and a full herd test must be completed in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the present situation where, because of the postponement of the annual round test, a herd becomes &ldquo;out of test&rdquo; viz. not tested in the previous 12 months, permission for a private test of individual animals will again be refused as the total herd must be tested. Where an individual requests a herd test, where his or her annual test is due, this will be facilitated by the DVO.</P>

      <P>In view of recent developments at EU level it is likely that in future there will be greater commercial demand for cattle slaughtered below 30 months. While the finishing of cattle is primarily a matter for the industry itself, my Department has asked Teagasc to prepare guidelines for farmers on the feeding and management strategies needed to facilitate the finishing of cattle before they reach 30 months of age. I understand that Teagasc has circulated a briefing document to its livestock advisers around the country. Teagasc has also prepared leaflets for farmers on this issue and will be holding a series of public demonstrations in the near future on appropriate feedings and breeding practices for cattle from the suckler cow herd.</P>
      <P>While it is the case that steers from the suckler herd will have the greatest difficulty in reaching the finishing stage by 30 months of age, Teagasc research shows that it is quite possible. Producers who wish to finish these cattle early will have to pay greater attention to good husbandry practices generally, including animal health, good performance at grass, silage quality and the feeding of concentrates where good quality silage is not available.</P>

      <P>The task of recovering the Egyptian market for Irish beef is based on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product. I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. I am satisfied that the Egyptian authorities have a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. However, in many of our non-EU markets, and Egypt is no exception, the situation has been exacerbated by sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on the BSE developments in those countries which have recently encountered their first cases.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that every effort, both directly and through diplomatic channels, is being made to re-open the Egyptian market to Irish beef. It is, however, clear that a restoration of exports to markets such as Egypt is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to reduce the level of transportation of animals in the interests of animal health and welfare; and in particular, if he will ensure the trend in closure of small abattoirs is reversed.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my Department's intention that the health and welfare standards that are established by EU Council Directive No. 91/628/EEC as amended are maintained to the highest level. In addition, I have introduced permit arrangements in respect of transport of susceptible animals to meat plants and for welfare reasons in the context of the foot and mouth disease, FMD, situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to abattoirs, small abattoirs with a throughput of less than 1,000 livestock units per annum are licensed and operated in accordance with the requirements of the Abattoirs Act, 1988. These small abattoirs are, however, required to achieve minimum standards regarding hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. I acknowledge the important role played by domestic abattoirs within the wider food sector and this has been reflected in the approach taken by my Department to establishments that comply with the regulations. However, given the absolute primacy of consumer protection, my Department cannot provide licences to those premises which do not achieve the minimum standard required.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> the number of appointments made to boards, both semi-State and private, under the aegis of her Department in each of the past years 1997-2001; if she will give, in regard to each year and each board to which appointments were made, the number and percentage of males and females appointed to each board; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought is outlined in the following appendix. I have always considered the need for gender balance on State boards when making appointments and since coming to office, I have established a track record for appointing first-rate people of both genders.</P>
      <P>The constitution of several boards mentioned in the appendix is governed by statute and I am obliged to make many appointments based on the nominations I receive. This effectively limits the scope to address some of the gender imbalances shown. The bodies nominating persons to boards have been advised of the Government's gender balance policy.</P>
      <P>I hope to see continued improvements in the gender balances of State boards under my aegis, and all boards in the public and private sector in the coming months and years.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> if she is satisfied that there is a suitable system of accreditation for flow measurement; and if she believes a national standard for flow measurement should be put in place. </Quest>

      <P>The National Accreditation Board, NAB, is the Irish organisation for the accreditation of laboratories and certification bodies. The NAB is the sole national body responsible for accreditation in accordance with relevant International Organisation for Standardisation, ISO, standards, the EN 45000 series of European standards and the applicable national and international regulations.</P>
      <P>Laboratory accreditation granted by the NAB is commonly referred to as &ldquo;ILAB&rdquo; accreditation. The ILAB scheme is voluntary and it is open to any laboratory that performs objective testing or calibration to apply for accreditation under this scheme. Quality of work and objectivity are the major elements considered when establishing the suitability of a laboratory for accreditation. The NAB has to date accredited one laboratory with a scope of accreditation for the calibration of flow meter devices over a specific range of flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several ISO standards dealing with the area of flow measurement of certain liquids and gases. In general it is considered that inter<Col N="1210" /> national methods of measurement are preferable to national methods, and there would be little if no added value in publishing such international standards as Irish standards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the setting up of a national reference standard for flow measurement similar to the other standard measurements held by the National Metrology Laboratory in Enterprise Ireland, the position is that flow measurement is related to mass, time and temperature, which are primary reference quantities. Thus the setting up of a national reference standard for flow measurement, depending as it does on other primary reference quantities, would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The current position is that, arising from the public consultation process, a total of 22 submissions were received in my Department relating to the project. One of these opposed the proposal on the grounds of inadequacy of information lodged, necessity for the proposed development and impact of the proposed development on the environment of it vicinity.</P>
      <P>One other submission sought the addition of a number of features, including safety features, which were not included in the proposal by the applicant, Mayo County Council.</P>
      <P>In accordance with standard practice the revised proposal was forwarded to the applicant which is being afforded an opportunity to comment before the application and submissions are considered in my Department. My Department is awaiting the council's response and the return of certain documentation from the council. On receipt of these the application will be processed.</P>

      <P>Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on 21 September 1992. In accordance with article 44 of the convention, <Col N="1215" /> Ireland is required to present reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child every five years. These reports must set out details of the protection afforded under Irish law to the rights guaranteed in the convention and detail how fully its provisions are being implemented. Ireland submitted its first national report to the committee in April 1996. That report was considered by the committee in Geneva on 12-13 January 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the publication in November 2000 of Ireland's first ever national children's strategy. The strategy provides a co-ordinating framework for the future development of children's policy and services delivery, and identifies clear goals and objectives to be achieved for children over the next ten years. While Ireland's second report to the committee was due on 27 October 1999, it was felt that as work was under way in relation to the preparation of the national children's strategy, submission should await its publication, so that the latest developments could be reflected in the report.</P>
      <P>The recently established National Children's Office, which was proposed in the strategy, will co-ordinate the drafting of Ireland's second report.</P>

      <P>A letter was received from the person referred to on 21 March 2001 and a response issued on 28 March 2001.</P>
      <P>Ireland signed the UN Convention Against Torture in 1992. Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act, 2000, the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are now finalising arrangements to enable Ireland to ratify the convention. It is hoped it will be possible to ratify the convention shortly and it is anticipated that a declaration will be made under article 22 of the convention recognising the competence of the committee against torture to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of individuals within Ireland who claim to be victims of a violation of the provisions of the convention.</P>

      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the recent outbreak of violence in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, FYROM. The Government's position was set out most recently in my reply of 27 March to a question from Deputy Durkan on this issue. Ireland has participated actively at EU level, at the OSCE and in discussions at the United Nations Security Council about the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and we have made our views known in these fora.</P>
      <P>We participated in the drafting of the United Nations Security Council resolution on the situation in FYROM adopted on 21 March. Ireland fully supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of FYROM and the inviolability of its borders. While regretting that military action was necessary to restore security in the northern FYROM area around Tetovo, we are relieved that the action that has been taken has resulted in minimum casualties to the civilian population in the area.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the commitment given by the President and Foreign Minister of FYROM at the European Council in Stockholm to enter into dialogue with the political leaders of the Albanian community in FYROM in order to address the legitimate grievances of that community. In common with our partners in the EU, Ireland will continue to monitor developments in the region closely with a view to disbursing humanitarian assistance for the vulnerable population should this be necessary.</P>
      <P>FYROM is already a major beneficiary of EU assistance and of the stability pact for south east Europe. To help bring about a rapid increase in stability, the EU plans to contribute 40 million euro to improve the situation for the Albanian minority. Support will be given<i>, inter alia,</i> to the Albanian-speaking university in Tetovo and to the Albanian speaking television and radio stations.</P>

      <P>The procurement of the LE<i> Róisin</i> was by way of tender competition in accordance with Government contact procedures and EU directives. The tender competition was run in two stages; a request for proposals, RFP, stage and a request for tenders, RFT, stage.</P>
      <P>The tender competition was advertised in the official journal of the EU on 9 November 1996. In the first stage of the competition, which closed on 10 January 1997, proposals in response to a broad specification were requested.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the proposals, a group representing the Department of Defence, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Naval Service was convened to evaluate and to develop a more clearly defined specification to be issued to a short list of suppliers in the second, restricted tender stage of the competition.</P>
      <P>Six companies were issued with the detailed specification and six tenders were received on 1 September 1997. The six tenders were evaluated with the help of a marine consultant. The contract was awarded to Appledore Shipbuilders Limited, Devon.</P>
      <P>The design rights to LE<i> Róisin</i> are held jointly between Kvaerner Masa Marine, Canada and Appledore Shipbuilders Limited. Kvaerner Masa Marine carried out the general design work and Appledore Shipbuilders Limited carried out the detailed design work. The design was modified to meet the requirements of the Naval Service. This is not an unusual occurrence in contracts of this nature but such modifications do not affect the original design rights to the vessel.</P>
      <P>The contract with Appledore Shipbuilders Limited allowed for the option of a second ship which was exercised and the second new ship, to be named LE<i> Niamh</i>, will be completed by the end of April 2001.</P>

      <P>The Army Pensions Acts provide that a disability pension may, following retirement, be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of permanent disablement due to a <Col N="1221" /> wound or injury attributable to military service, whether at home or abroad, or to a disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with a United Nations force. Applications for a disability pension in respect of a wound or injury must be submitted to the pensions section, Department of Defence, Aras an tSaile, Renmore, Galway, within one year of discharge from the Permanent Defence Force and applications in respect of a disease must be made within eight years of discharge. An application for a disability pension in respect of depression could be considered if the condition was due to a wound or to overseas service.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence Forces pension scheme, a soldier qualifies for a service pension payable immediately on discharge if he has at least 21 years' service. The minimum service requirement is 12 years if the soldier is discharged on medical grounds. Retired soldiers are also eligible for benefits such as disability benefit and invalidity pension under the Social Welfare Acts subject to the usual conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has since 1988 operated a salmonella monitoring programme in poultry breeding flocks, table egg layers and poultry meat carcases. The programme was set up as a voluntary code of practice with the co-operation of the poultry and egg industry and the Irish Grain and Feed Association. The programme sets out approved guidelines for the control of salmonella typhimurimum,S.t., and salmonella enteritidis,S.e.</P>
      <P>As regards the pig sector, a salmonella programme has been in operation since 1997 which involves the testing and categorisation of herds and differentiated treatment of the pigs from those herds based on the results. This programme operated on a voluntary basis with producers and the processing industry working in conjunction with my Department.</P>
      <P>Arrangments are almost finalised for the establishment of an enhanced programme on a statutory basis. A difficulty has arisen with the test methods used under the voluntary scheme which has caused it to be suspended and the introduction of the enhanced scheme to be delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been working on a revised testing system which will form the basis of the new scheme. This work should be completed shortly. Testing personnel are being recruited and <Col N="1222" /> while it is envisaged that the testing will initially be carried out in the Department's central veterinary laboratory in Abbotstown, it will be taken over by the industry at the earliest opportunity thereafter. Most of the costs of running this scheme will be for the industry, as has been the case under the voluntary scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have from the very outset acknowledged that the prevention and control measures put in place in relation to foot and mouth disease, FMD, impose constraints on farmers throughout the country, and particularly within the zones associated with the FMD outbreak at Meigh, County Armagh and latterly with the outbreak at Proleek on the Cooley Peninsula. The constraints imposed on farmers, and indeed many other sections of the community, are unavoidable if this country is to have a realistic prospect of avoiding a situation even more grave than that which we have faced to date. The farming community has perhaps most to lose should FMD spread within the State and I am confident that farmers and their representatives clearly understand the need for the measures now in place. In so far as any adjustments to such measures are concerned, I will take account of the views of the expert committee which I recently established to keep under ongoing review our array of controls and advice to various sectors. It may be some time, however, before normal farming activity in this country can resume without risk.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 82, 88 and 89 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restrictions on movement apply in three broad areas. These are restrictions relating to the import from the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, France and the Netherlands of certain animals and certain categories of animal prod<Col N="1226" /> ucts; restrictions on the movements of certain animals and certain categories of products within the zones associated with the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, at Meigh, County Armagh and latterly at Proleek, County Louth; and, restrictions on the movement of animals within the State generally. There are restrictions in place relating to other specific areas such as the importation of hay, straw, farm machinery, etc.</P>
    <P>Certain of these restrictions derive from EU legal obligations and all are necessary if this country is to have a reasonable prospect of preventing the spread of FMD and avoiding a situation even more serious than that which we have faced to date. The restrictions now in place are appropriate to the current situation but I have from the very outset made it clear that any measures which may be deemed necessary to deal with the situation as it evolves will be taken. Our approach to date is consistent with this philosophy.</P>
    <P>Every citizen has a responsibility to comply fully with the restrictions in place. To do otherwise is to undermine the massive effort and considerable sacrifice which has been made by all sections of the community in this country since the first outbreak of FMD in the UK. The gravity of the situation should be apparent to everyone and I do not believe there can be any excuse for non-compliance with the necessary restrictions, which are in place. Any flaunting of these restrictions in so far as the movement of animals is concerned would be particularly unacceptable. I am satisfied however that farmers generally and their representatives appreciate and support the need for these restrictions and would wish to see them being complied with in full.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary to police the movement restrictions and this has been done by the Garda Síochána, acting in support of my Department. All vehicles traversing the Border are stopped by the Garda. Of these, 1,217 vehicles have been turned back. In the course of the operation 874 seizures have been made. While not all of the seizures relate to foot and mouth, where irregularities have been detected in this regard, details have been taken with a view to prosecution in such cases. The Garda has also carried out extensive checks throughout the State on vehicles carrying livestock to ensure that the relevant permits are to hand. Where drivers have been found without permits the vehicle and its consignment has been directed to return to the point of departure. In some cases this has been done under Garda escort. Details of these cases are being compiled by the Garda. The penalties for offences under the Diseases of Animals Act range up to £100,000 and-or five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I ask anyone with knowledge of breaches of the restrictions on animal movements to make such information available to their local district veterinary office or to the Garda so that the matter can be investigated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 87, 93 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from the foot and mouth crisis there are additional import controls and conditions pertaining to the importation of products of animal origin from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France. Such products are prohibited except under health certification issued by the competent authority in the exporting country and which is in compliance with the relevant Commission decision addressed to that country. The policing of this regime is, in the first instance, a matter for the exporting country. However, I am satisfied that the comprehensive controls in place at ports and airports in Ireland are sufficient to prevent the importation of products not conforming to the Commission decision on foot and mouth disease in the unlikely event that they succeed in passing domestic export controls in the exporting country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has from the outset been an EU dimension to the handling of the foot and mouth disease, FMD, crisis, which now involves cases in the UK, France, the Netherlands and Ireland. Using established procedures, the Standing Veterinary Committee has played a central role in relation to the precautionary measures put in place by various member states, and will continue to so do. In addition, the matter has been the subject of discussion at <Col N="1228" /> Council of Agriculture Ministers level and I anticipate it will remain on the agenda of Council for some time to come. Not alone do we need involvement of all member states at EU level to handle the current crisis, we also need to review the lessons to be learned from it and to take appropriate action into the future. I have been in direct contact with ministerial counterparts in other member states in relation to particular aspects of the FMD situation which as matters have evolved have been of particular mutual concern.</P>
      <P>It has been necessary to police the movement restrictions and this has been done by the Garda Síochána, acting in support of my Department. All vehicles traversing the Border are stopped by the Garda. Of these, 1,217 vehicles have been turned back. In the course of the operation 874 seizures have been made. While not all of the seizures relate to foot and mouth, where irregularities have been detected in this regard, details have been taken with a view to prosecution in such cases. The Garda has also carried out extensive checks throughout the State on vehicles carrying livestock to ensure that the relevant permits are to hand. Where drivers have been found without permits the vehicle and its consignment has been directed to return to the point of departure. In some cases this has been done under Garda escort. Details of these cases are being compiled by the Garda. The penalties for offences under the Diseases of Animals Act range up to £100,000 and-or five years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I ask anyone with knowledge of breaches of the restrictions on animal movements to make such information available to their local district veterinary office or to the Garda so that the matter can be investigated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the animal health policies, intra-Community trade in live animals is governed by horizontal EU legislation requiring appropriate health precautions to be taken in member states. Similarly, third countries wishing to trade with European Union member states are required to meet certain animal health requirements and are <Col N="1229" /> subject to veterinary inspections by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission. Animal health issues in EU member states and in third countries wishing to trade with the EU are monitored by the European Commission's Standing Veterinary Committee, which meets regularly and in which officials from my Department participate.</P>
    <P>The animal health regimes have been the subject of intense discussion at the Council of Ministers in recent times, most recently because of the foot and mouth crisis. At these discussions, I have encouraged the European Commission and other member states to adopt the most stringent regimes for the protection of both livestock and consumers.</P>

      <Col N="1230" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): The total number of cattle and sheep culled up to Wednesday, 28 March, is 1,013 and 23,450, respectively. My Department is continuing its tracing activity and will continue to take precautionary action where it is considered that this is necessary to prevent any possible risk of spreading foot and mouth disease. Any decision to extend the slaughter of susceptible species in the Cooley Peninsula will depend on the evolving situation and, in particular, on the results of the tests being carried out at Pirbright in relation to the suspect animals in Piedmont.</P>

      <P>Arising from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, FMD, in the United Kingdom, a ban on the importation from the UK, including Northern Ireland, of susceptible animals and certain categories of animal products has applied since 21 February 2001. My Department, in conjunction with the Garda and with the co-operation of our counterparts in Northern Ireland, has undertaken extensive investigations aimed at tracing any susceptible animals which may have entered the State from the UK in the period from 1 February up to 21 February 2001. These investigations have made very good headway. Such investigations had led to the precautionary slaughter of susceptible animals in counties Wexford, Mayo, Roscommon, Meath, Laois, Carlow and Louth. There is no evidence of any susceptible animals having been imported from the UK since the imposition on 21 February 2001 of the import ban.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the importation of processed animal proteins. Under the provisions of the European Communities (Processed Animal Products) <Col N="1231" /> Regulations, 2000, S.I. No. 486 of 2000, certain protection measures with regard to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and the feeding of animal protein were given effect in Irish law on 29 December 2000 and entered into force on 1 January 2001. In effect the legislation prohibited the importation of processed animal proteins except under licence and subject to specific conditions and the feeding of processed animal proteins to farmed animals. Stocks on hand were withdrawn from the market, distribution channels and on-farm storage. My Department is continuously monitoring this situation and where necessary will take the appropriate action to ensure compliance with the measures required by this legislation.</P>

      <P>There is a significant incentive available to motorists to use automotive LPG. The Irish rate of duty on automotive LPG at £41.75 per 1,000 litres compares favourably to the higher rates of £196.14 per 1,000 litres for auto diesel and £274.44 per 1,000 litres for unleaded petrol. The EU sets minimum rates for mineral oils, including LPG, under Council Directive 92/82/EEC and the minimum rate for auto LPG is £39.70 per 1,000 litres. Any further reduction by me is not practicable given the EU minimum rates. I have no plans to introduce additional reliefs to assist motorists to convert to and use automotive LPG.</P>

      <P>The best approach towards enhancing low disposable incomes is to pursue policies which increase the numbers of jobs available and which improve the quality of jobs on offer. Success in these respects broadens opportunity to achieve higher levels of real earnings. The stability and growth oriented economic and budgetary strategy being pursued by the Government is a core requirement for expanding employment and enhancing its overall quality.</P>

      <P>I understand that in the context of this question, indigenous food products are food products that are native to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1 January 1999 under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. The Food <Col N="1234" /> Safety Authority is a major catalyst for changing the food safety culture in Ireland. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is an independent agency whose function is to ensure that food produced, marketed or distributed within the State meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. The authority was the first in Europe to be set up with this independent status &ndash; independent of industry and sectoral interests, an independence which is very important to consumers.</P>
    <P>There are currently 1,900 professionals engaged, either full time or part time, in the food control services, working to protect consumer health. A major function of the authority is to co-ordinate the efforts of these professionals to maintain the highest standards of safety and hygiene. The authority has welded together all the separate agencies and organisations into one unified, focused structure dedicated to ensuring the highest possible standards of food safety and food hygiene in partnership with all those involved in the food chain.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for and ownership of excellence and standards primarily and ultimately lies with those involved in the food chain. This involves farmers, processors, retailers, caterers and consumers. The authority is working in partnership with every sector in the food chain to develop awareness of the importance of good practice, the controls to be applied and the risks to be managed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> If Ireland is to succeed and prosper as a food producing nation, with consumers at home and abroad confident in the safety and wholesomeness of our food, then the production of safe, quality food has to be of the highest priority.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that customer confidence, both at home and abroad, in Irish food products needs to be paramount. We in Ireland must be in a position to give independent and verifiable assurances as to the quality and purity of our food products. For this reason, the Government established the authority as a statutory, independent and science-based body, overseeing all functions relating to the food safety regulation of the food industry. This model is being followed in the European context, where the European Food Authority is being set up by the European Commission on a similar basis.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland co-ordinates a national food surveillance programme in collaboration with the health boards where foods in the retail market are sampled and analysed for safety by the public analyst laboratories and the food microbiology laboratories. Pesticide and veterinary drug residues in foods in the retail market are monitored by the specialist laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Food producing premises are regularly inspected by the official agents of the authority for compliance with food regulations. The authority is also working with private food industry to develop codes of practice to ensure that the best standards of quality and hygiene are applied in the production of food products in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, that Bord Bia currently operates quality assurance schemes in three areas, namely, beef, pigmeat and eggs. In addition, parameters have been agreed for a quality assurance scheme for lamb and, more recently, Bord Bia has been in dialogue with poultry processors and producers regarding a scheme for that sector. The schemes are structured to the highest international standards and ensure full traceability along the production chain. In view of the importance attaching to quality assurance schemes and the need to enhance consumer and customer credibility through independent verification in accordance with internationally recognised standards, a new Bord Bia subsidiary board for quality assurance has been established with the dual function of overseeing the operation of the board's quality assurance schemes and of certifying schemes in accordance with EN45011.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, the national beef assurance scheme was launched in mid-1997 with a view to guaranteeing the safety of Irish beef and beef products in line with consumer demands and to restoring consumer <Col N="1236" /> confidence in the wake of recent food scares, notably the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, further states that the scheme has three main elements: the development of transparent and integrated production and processing protocols applicable to all parties in the food chain; the enforcement of these protocols through a registration and approval process covering the entire industry; and the provision of an effective bovine animal identification and tracing system, enhancing the identification and tracing systems already in place.</P>
    <P>The national beef assurance scheme was established on a statutory basis on 15 March 2000. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has stated that An Bord Glas operates a quality auditing scheme for horticultural food products. The scheme establishes high standards of quality and hygiene for the production, handling, storage and marketing of produce.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance schemes were highlighted in 1999 by the report of the Food Industry Development Group which said that the food industry will maximise its potential through attention to competitiveness and market orientation and that development must be underpinned by attention to food safety, quality standards and quality assurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has also advised me of the food quality assurance schemes review group which was established in February 2000 with the following terms of reference: to review schemes currently in operation in the light of future requirements of consumers and the food industry; to examine the accreditation procedures applying to each scheme; and to make appropriate recommendations as to how greater coherence and clarity might be brought to the whole area of quality assurance.</P>
    <P>The group presented its report in December 2000 and I understand that the recommendations made are currently under review.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a letter sent to a publication (details supplied) signed by 24 non-consultant hospital doctors from eight different hospitals who are non-EU doctors and who are claiming that an injustice has been done by not offering them the same equal opportunities and have accused the Government of discriminating against them and showing preferential treatment to the recently recruited doctors from India and Pakistan and that, by allowing them to bypass the assessment examination, the Government has given them preferential treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>During the first half of 2000, health employers endeavoured to fill NCHD anaesthetic vacancies through the usual channels. This was not successful and some vacancies were left unfilled. The recruitment initiative in India and Pakistan was primarily concerned with resolving difficulties which had arisen with anaesthetic non-consultant hospital doctor vacancies. These doctors are employed under a sponsorship programme and, by virtue of this scheme, are exempt from the Medical Council's assessment examination. This is not the first time the sponsorship system has been used. Three year contracts are being offered by health service employers provided these doctors fulfil the training requirements.</P>

      <P>The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, made a number of recommendations on the role of general practitioners in the prevention of coronary heart disease. A programme of managed care of patients with cardiovascular disease has been identified as the priority recommendation, in line with the priorities of the task force of the European Cardiac Society on prevention in clinical practice. The sum of £2 million has been allocated in 2001 for the implementation of the first phase of such a programme. This will be evaluated so that future phases of the programme can learn from the experience gained in implementing this first phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting to discuss the first phase of the programme of managed care in general practice was held in January of this year as part of the work of the advisory forum on cardiovascular health. A steering committee was established, with representatives of the health boards, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Department of Health and Children. A sub-group has been working to agree the content of the programme and the arrangements for implementation by the health boards in association with the Irish College of General Practitioners. It is expected that a sample of general practitioners will be involved in each of the health boards, providing treatment and follow-up according to an agreed protocol. This will include advice about lifestyle and, where appropriate, medication to reduce the risk of heart attack or related diseases in the future. It is hoped to agree the protocol and put procedures in place for the first phase of the programme by the summer of this year. This phase will last for 12 months and will then be evaluated. When the <Col N="1242" /> protocol and procedures have been agreed for implementation in the summer, I will be in a position to provide more information on the details of the programme.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I launched phase 1 of the national immunisation programme aimed at the prevention of Group C meningitis on 20 October 2000.

This phase of the campaign is now almost complete and preliminary uptake information available from health boards is positive. Phase 2 of the campaign commenced recently and will target primary school children as a priority.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of Parents of Autistic Children Together at the end of November 2000. It was agreed at that meeting that a number of issues which were raised by them would be followed up with the relevant services.</P>
      <P>The question of assistance for families in relation to the dietary needs of their children is being followed up by my Department, as is the question of the involvement of appropriate medical personnel in a multi-disciplinary approach to the medical needs of this group.</P>
      <P>My Department has also raised with the Department of Education and Science the need for increased pre-school provision and will continue to work with that Department in relation to this matter. I understand that the director of services for children on the autism spectrum in the eastern region has spoken to the parents about the query they had regarding the possible assignment of project workers to the outreach classes.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall development of services to persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability in 2001, further additional revenue funding amounting to £625,000 in 2001, with a full year cost of £750,000 in 2002, has been allocated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in respect of the provision of health related support services to children with autism. Capital funding of £1 million has also been made available to the authority for these services in 2001. As a result of this funding, an additional ten posts are in the process of being advertised for the various support teams, together with a further ten posts of family support worker. While the services continue to have vacancies within the existing support teams in the areas of speech and language and occupational therapy, the South Western Area Health Board is endeavouring to explore all possible options in relation to the recruitment of appropriate staff for the services.</P>

No. 142 of 1998) medical practitioners are entitled to prescribe any medicine, including hypericum perforatum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a medicinal product may not be placed on the market in this country unless it is the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board in accordance with the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998. Article 4 of the regulations provides a number of exemptions to this requirement, including the situation where &ldquo;the importation or sale of a medicinal product is by or to the order of a registered medical practitioner or registered dentist for the treatment of a patient in his care&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This exemption was primarily provided to facilitate physicians who wish to use unlicensed products for the therapeutic benefit of their patients. Medical practitioners are in a position to advise their patients about unlicensed drugs and would also be aware of possible interactions with other medications. The safety concerns identified by the Irish Medicines Board in the case of hypericum perforatum included potential interactions with other medications viz. cylosporin, the contraceptive pill, warfarin, digoxin and theophylline. In addition the board was concerned that St. John's Wort &ndash; hypericum perforatum &ndash; was being widely advertised for the treatment of depression and openly sold in many outlets for this purpose. The board considered that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self-diagnosis and self-medication were inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, at my request, is currently investigating the possibility of developing an interim licensing system for traditional use products, including herbal medicinal products, which would allow such products to be lawfully marketed in this country. A senior assessor was appointed to the board last year to facilitate a detailed review of the arrangements to be put in place for the introduction of such a scheme. I expect that the draft proposals will be submitted to me in the autumn, following a detailed consultation process involving all interested parties.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department works closely with a range of statutory and voluntary groups to ensure that people have the information and the support to make healthy lifestyle choices. The unit supports an extensive range of initiatives organised by the Irish Cancer Society, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers, including melanomas.</P>
      <P>This support enables the society to organise an information and awareness campaign entitled Sunsmart. This begins in May each year, just before the holiday season gets under way. The campaign provides information packs and leaflets both to those who are travelling abroad and to those who remain in Ireland. These materials provide comprehensive information on the nature, incidence and causes of skin cancers. Methods of identification are discussed and pictures depicting moles etc. are shown. The leaflets also provide guidance on what to do in the case of a suspected skin cancer.</P>
      <P>The health boards through the health promotion officers assist the Irish Cancer Society in the distribution of these information packs to pharmacies, health centres etc.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has also produced information materials in relation to the dangers of the sun and the precautions to be taken when going abroad on sun holidays.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 some £60 million has been allocated from national cancer strategy funding to allow the development of consultant oncology, consultant palliative care, consultant histopathology and consultant haematology services throughout the country. A cervical screening programme has been launched, the national breast screening programme has also been launched, a report on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease is currently being implemented, an expert group is currently examining the further development of radiotherapy services and an expert group on palliative care is due to submit its report shortly.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme and the findings of the report are being fully considered in my Department. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report and the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided that payments should be made to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the regulations which allowed for the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters and which was removed with effect from 1 January 1999. A group representing my Department and the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established and is putting in place procedures to ensure that moneys will be paid in a uniform manner as quickly as possible to those whose subvention was unfavourably affected by this regulation. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to investigate the matter and reply directly.</P>

      <Quest>if the blasting of quarries that have been dormant for more than 25 years can take place without planning permission; if he is satisfied that in all instances of quarry blasting, adequate monitoring of blasting procedures takes place; his views on whether there are suitably qualified staff in each local authority area to read the reports on blasting procedures issued by the independent monitors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Planning permission may be required where a person resumes quarrying activity at a site where that use has been abandoned or renewed activity amounts to an intensification of use of the quarry. If there <Col N="1249" /> is a doubt as to whether planning permission is required, the matter can be referred to An Bord Pleanála for decision.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, requires the registration of quarries, which are over five years in operation with the planning authorities. Planning authorities will be entitled to impose environmental conditions on the operation of registered quarries, following a public notification procedure. In the case of the many quarries, which have been in use since before the coming into force of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, a planning authority may decide that a quarry requires environmental impact assessment where, in its view, the continued operation of the quarry would be likely to have significant effects on the environment. In such a case, an application for planning permission must be made to the planning authority. Draft planning guidelines to assist the implementation of this section of the Act will be prepared by my Department in consultation with relevant bodies this year and it is my intention to bring the provision into force in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Where monitoring reports in relation to quarrying are received by local authorities, I am not aware of any lack of expertise in local authorities in reading and interpreting those monitoring reports on quarries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, outlined the need for a major reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach utilising a range of waste treatment options to deliver effective and efficient waste services and ambitious recycling and recovery targets.</P>
      <P>It outlined some of the main issues associated with the use of alternative collection practices and waste treatment technologies and pointed out that no one solution can address all waste management requirements. Accordingly, local authorities were advised to identify and fully assess the various issues involved with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix of facilities which, in their circumstances, appeared to offer the best balance between maximised output of materials or energy and minimised environmental emissions at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding this advice and the waste recovery targets set out in Changing our Ways, current and proposed regional waste management plans incorporate proposals for: household segregation and separate collection of organic and dry recycl<Col N="1250" /> able wastes in urban areas; an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, with specified target densities; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities; support for home composting, especially in rural areas; thermal treatment facilities; and landfill facilities for disposal of residual wastes.</P>
    <P>The number, nature and scale of waste treatment facilities provided for in local and regional plans vary, depending on the specific circumstances in each of the functional areas or regions concerned.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is <Col N="1258" /> aware that, arising from the current buoyancy in the economy, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds continues to grow at an unprecedented level, with each successive year setting new record levels.</P>
      <P>In order to address this problem, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by 77. The resulting appointments are currently being made following a recruitment drive by the Civil Service Commission, which is now beginning to pay dividends.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems that have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management is implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data-capture of folios and maps.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation in relation to arrears will improve.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on the complexity of the case, the standard of the documentation forwarded by solicitors, the time taken by solicitors to reply to queries etc. I am also informed that any cases involving urgency are, in accordance with the customer-service policy of the Land Registry, dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that a number of initiatives were implemented in the Land Registry during 2000, including the roll out of ITRIS, integrated title registration information system, and the allocation of additional staff to the Land Registry. The impact of these measures is now evident and the output of work in the Land Registry for the first two months of 2001 has been at record levels. It is anticipated that, with further progress, the delays in registration will continue to reduce over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the situation regarding service delivery is improving in the Land Registry. Paragraph A.42 of Implementing the Information Society: A Framework for Action &ndash; December <Col N="1259" /> 2000 &ndash; mandated the Land Registry to undertake a flagship project to provide an electronic service for folio access. This was achieved through the successful implementation in August 1999 of the Land Registry electronic access service, which provides on-line access over the World Wide Web to the organisation's existing computerised database of folios and related indices of registered land. During 2000, 125,000 applications <Col N="1260" /> were handled through the electronic access service.</P>
    <P>The figures shown in the following tabular statement for Kildare-Wicklow represent the timeframe for any case lodged since the roll out of ITRIS. I have been informed by the Land Registry that pre-ITRIS cases in these areas are taking approximately 20 weeks for dealings not requiring mapping and 104 weeks for dealings requiring mapping.</P>

      <Quest>the completion date of the review, announced by him on 27 April 1998, into arrangements for the granting of business permission to individuals to reside here and subsequent naturalisation applications which were to be carried out by his Department in consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies; and if he will make the report of the review available to the Oireachtas.</Quest>

      <P>On 20 April 1998, the Government abolished the investment based naturalisation scheme which had commenced in 1989. In doing so, it also decided that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should initiate a review of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, to see how it might facilitate investment and, if in the course of that review, information emerged which would warrant additional legislative measures, he should consider this.</P>
      <P>To assist in conducting the review, I established a review group, comprising representatives of my Department, which chaired the group, the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, together with two outside experts.</P>
      <P>The group completed its review in May 2000 and it is currently being examined in detail by officials in my Department with a view to its submission to Government in due course. As I have indicated in the House previously, it is my intention that the report will be published when this process has been completed. In the interim, the situation is as I indicated on 20 April 1998. The scheme stands abolished and I have no plans to re-introduce it.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was arrested on 6 January 2001 on foot of seven warrants received from the United Kingdom authorities seeking his extradition in connection with charges of burglary and theft and he was brought before the courts on that date.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service that he was committed to Cloverhill Remand Prison later that day on foot of a committal warrant under the Extradition Act, 1965, ordering his detention pending a further appearance in relation to this issue at the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.</P>
      <P>He was subsequently transferred to Mountjoy Prison on 12 January 2001 to serve a three month prison sentence in accordance with a committal warrant reissued in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court on that date. This sentence was originally imposed on 25 March 1999 for the offence of having no insurance on his motor vehicle.</P>
      <P>The prisoner completed this sentence on 19 March 2001 and was then transferred to Cloverhill Remand Prison, where he is currently held on foot of seven orders for extradition issued by the Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 14 March 2001.</P>
      <P>The requirements and the procedures to be followed in respect of extradition from Ireland to Britain and Northern Ireland are governed by Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended. The Criminal Assets Bureau is not involved in extradition cases from Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is one outstanding burglary charge in this jurisdiction in respect of this person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>In past years, psychological assessment of national school children, including those suspected of having dyslexia, has been the responsibility of psychologists employed by the health boards and by voluntary agencies under their aegis. However, the Government decided in early 1999 that my Department should take the lead role in the provision of educational psychological services to schools. In September 1999, therefore, my Department established the National Educational Psychological Service agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; with the remit of developing a service that would be available to all primary and post-primary schools. NEPS is organised in collaboration with the clinical services provided and funded by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The expansion of the NEPS to all schools is proceeding in an orderly and phased manner to allow for the recruitment and induction of appropriately qualified psychologists. It has just begun a programme of expansion and improvement of level of service. At the end of the school year 2003-04, it is envisaged that all schools will have access to the service offered by the agency.</P>
      <P>In those schools served by NEPS, the psychologists do not keep waiting lists in the sense of lists of named students who are seen in order. However, an important part of the psychologists' work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. As stated above, this service will eventually be available to all schools.</P>
      <P>I am aware that teachers and parents of children in schools not yet served by NEPS have experienced difficulties in gaining access to psycho-educational assessments. I have therefore asked NEPS to develop a short-term strategy to alleviate the situation pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists to the agency. The matter of waiting lists in the health boards does not come within the remit of NEPS or my Department.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of the advisability of early assessment, diagnosis and intervention in the case of children with specific learning difficulties. In early October, I formally launched a task force to review educational policies and provision for children with dyslexia &ndash; specific reading disability. The task force will report to me shortly with its recommendations.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the way in which he proposes to respond to the outrage among many members of the public at the failure by Government to provide the necessary educational supports for Jamie Sinnott and others in need of similar care in society; and if he will radically overhaul the attitude and resources in his Department to remove the necessity for families to take the Government to court to secure basic educational and health facilities.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am constrained in commenting specifically on the case to which he refers due to the fact that the appeal in this matter has now opened in the Supreme Court. The court is the most appropriate forum where the legal and constitutional matters at issue can now be discussed and determined. However, I point out that the appeal will not affect damages that have already been paid to Jamie Sinnott. Irrespective of the appeal, there is no question of these damages being refunded. Fifteen thousand pounds in special damages have also been paid to Mrs. Sinnott and will not be affected by the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding and even misrepresentation of the Government's position on this appeal. In particular, the impression has been created that the Government wants to overturn the High Court ruling which relates to the constitutional rights of chil<Col N="1265" /> dren to a primary education, whatever their level of disability. Nothing could be further from the truth. I assure the Deputy that I fully accept my constitutional duty, on behalf of the State, in this regard.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I regard it as unacceptable that any parent, particularly a parent of a child with special needs, should find it necessary to resort to litigation to secure the child's educational entitlements. While this Government has presided over an unprecedented level of improvement in special education services, I am fully aware that much work remains to be done. In addition to developing the most appropriate models of response to the variety of special needs that can arise, there is also a need to develop a more effective and efficient system for responding to those needs when and where they arise.</P>
    <P>A key development in this regard is the recent report of the planning group established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements that should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high-quality co-ordinated services at all stages of the education system for students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the recommendations brought forward by the planning group provide a valuable blueprint for the development of an efficient and effective special education service which will remove the need for parents to have to resort to litigation to secure their entitlements. It is my intention to seek Government approval to proceed with these measures at an early date.</P>
