      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>A copy of the OECD's report, Regulatory Reform in Ireland, was presented to the Government on 24 April 2001. A copy has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members, together with a copy of my speech on receipt of the report and the press releases issued by the OECD and the Government.</P>
      <P>The report marks the culmination of a very detailed review process. As I said in my remarks at the time, the Government welcomes the report. I am pleased that it both records the good progress which has been made in certain areas of regulatory reform and points out areas where further actions are needed. Regulatory reform is a complex issue which cuts across the responsibilities of many Ministers, Departments and agencies. The usefulness of the report is that it draws together, probably for the first time in Ireland's case, all relevant aspects of the regulatory reform agenda.</P>
      <P>In terms of the Government's initial response to the OECD report, a number of actions are being taken. I have written to the chairman of the joint Oireachtas committee on the SMI, inviting the committee to consider the report. A national policy statement on regulatory reform is also proposed and the precise form this will take is under consideration. A number of important studies are already under way &ndash; on the regulation of pubs and pharmacies, for example. In addition, the Competition Authority has initiated a study of professional services. I understand a preliminary public consultation on the scope of the study will be completed this week.</P>
      <P>A key element of the Government's response is the establishment of a high level group on regulation. This will be an important mechanism to ensure greater coherence in implementing regulatory reform measures across the full spectrum of the State's activities. The Departments, Offices and other bodies which will be involved are listed in a table which is being circulated to Deputies as part of this reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, which will chair the group at assistant secretary level, is in consultation with the relevant Departments and bodies with regard to nominations to the group. It is intended that <Col N="1055" /> the first meeting of the group will take place on 31 May.</P>
    <P>The group's broad remit will be to formulate proposals and oversee implementation of the Government's response to the OECD report and advise the Government on progress being achieved. Its work will include consideration of options for implementing a model of regulatory impact assessment in the public service. The full terms of reference of the group are also being circulated with my reply.</P>
    <P>My Department's role remains one of co-ordination and support. Clearly, individual Ministers and Departments will continue to have responsibility for regulatory reform measures in their own areas. In terms of timescale, the OECD report sets out very challenging and wide-ranging recommendations. Given their complexity and, in some instances, legislative basis, full implementation will take some time. However, the Government envisages that the high level group will make a significant contribution in terms of mapping out strategic priorities to be addressed within a period of one year from the date of its inception. The group will be asked to work to this timescale and make a progress report to the Government in the interim.</P>

      <i>
      </i>1. The main objective of the high level group on regulatory reform is to:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> provide a cross-agency mechanism to examine the findings of the OECD's report on regulatory reform in Ireland, to consider existing and emerging implementation plans and to report to the Government on a regular basis regarding measures in place, progress being achieved and any difficulties being encountered;</P>
    <P>2.It is envisaged that the work of the group will include: </P>
    <P>(a)consideration of options for a model of regulatory impact analysis for implementation in the public service and assistance with the design of such a model and/or selection of expertise;</P>
    <P>(b)availing of the unique composition of the group to identify any inhibitors to the development of a coherent cross-sectoral system of regulatory management at national level;</P>
    <P>(c)consideration of institutional and policy responses to give effect to, not only the recommendations of the OECD report, but a robust framework of regulatory management going forward.</P>
    <P>3.The group will have a timeframe of one year within which to deliver its final report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Does he agree that in one set of circumstances, regulations are necessary to ensure free, fair and effective competition but that in another, the removal of regulations currently on the Statute Book is also necessary to provide for full and fair competition? Will he indicate specifically what the Government proposes to do in regard to regulations which restrict qualifications for those wishing to practise as pharmacists in Ireland to Irish nationals, regulations which do not recognise the validity of qualifications obtained in other EU countries? This is clearly a restrictive practice which acts to the detriment of consumers and should be removed without delay. Does the Taoiseach agree that the geographical restrictions on the location of pharmacies also act to the detriment of consumers in view of the very high price of drugs, particularly non-prescription drugs, sold in these outlets? Notwithstanding the ongoing study, will he indicate what is his personal attitude to these matters and when, at a time when we are seeking workers from other countries, including EU countries, will the restrictions on pharmacists who qualified in other EU countries be removed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the comments made by the Deputy at the outset which echo the findings of the OECD report. The regulatory reform process also entailed a large element of self-assessment over a period of time and the regulatory impact analysis spells out the areas in which regulation is required. Not alone are new regulations required but existing regulations and other items we and the OECD consider obstacles <Col N="1057" /> must be removed. More efficiency in and more effective regulation of the economy is required. Codification in certain areas and simpler systems are also necessary, although this might not only involve regulations. I do not agree with every aspect of the OECD report, but it stated that bottlenecks in some areas could be easily removed. That might be more difficult in other areas, but the OECD said that poor regulation is bad for the organisation of business and it highlighted many cases in that regard. The Deputy referred to two aspects with regard to pharmacies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Qualifications and location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those issues were considered relatively recently in the legislation governing this area, which was enacted in the past five years. It is different in that respect. However, such provisions, particularly those of a more recent vintage, are usually included for a reason. They are not included unless a case is made for them.</P>
      <P>Arguments continue on the points made by the Deputy and others about pharmacies. The sectoral review groups' discussions of those matters are well advanced. The matter again arose in the OECD report and I am in favour of easing the regulations for people coming in. However, the issue of location is not as simple because the argument of the Department of Health argument is that it is important that pharmacies are of a high quality. This is the purpose of the regulations. The Department is responsible for the regulations in this area and it wants to ensure that pharmacies meet international standards. It is not a case of locating a number of pharmacies in particular areas; it wants to ensure they are of sufficient quality.</P>
      <P>The matter is under examination and the sectoral review groups will have an opportunity to put their cases. However, the OECD sees the matter differently. Its contention is that such arguments are always made by professions, but when such issues are resolved, everything works and areas can be regulated. That is the body's experience and it has already implemented similar proposals to those for Ireland in a number of countries. I met the group a number of times last year and earlier this year for the launch. Its argument is that although Ireland is well advanced, too protective a view is taken in some areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of deregulation of the electricity industry, is the Taoiseach aware that the limited competition that is beginning to operate is being handled in a manner that is causing huge frustration for potential new entrants to the market? Does he share the fears highlighted in the DKM report and elsewhere about the possibility of energy shortages in the near future and the potential implications that would have for the economy, particularly the technology and data hosting sectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1058" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some concern that there could be some difficulties next winter. It is unlikely, but there is a concern. The Deputy is correct about technology companies. Web farms use an enormous amount of electricity. There are a number of such operations in Ireland and efforts are being made to expand that area. The issue of the amount of electricity they require has not yet been addressed in some areas. The Minister for Public Enterprise and the ESB outlined the increased capital requirements. It is a money argument in terms of the additional capacity the system can take. Work is ongoing in that area and the Minister for Public Enterprise will be in a position to confirm if it is ongoing in other areas.</P>
      <P>The Commission for Electricity Regulation will be part of the high level group on regulation. More progress on deregulation at EU level would have been made at the last meeting of the European Council but for the French backing down on it. I do not see that as a difficulty for us. We can proceed with preparatory work and legislative measures. Although there is a problem with France, there is a necessity for us to proceed with electricity deregulation as quickly as possible because that will introduce more competition and provide greater capital input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there will be power cuts next winter because of under capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has indicated to the House that if remedial work is not undertaken on some aspects over the summer months and if no capital investment is made, difficulties will arise. The ESB is acting on that basis. Similar concerns arose last year and there were some difficulties but thankfully not many. Significant investment will be required now and for a number of years. The web farms and related technology use an enormous multiple of even the consumption used by some hi-tech firms. We must increase capacity to be able to deal with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree with the OECD's recommendation of a further gallop in the privatisation of electricity and gas? Does he believe the disastrous privatisation of Telecom Éireann should be replicated in the ESB where people would be conned by the Government into substantial losses, where the atomisation of an asset belonging to the people would take place and where there would be a repeat of the current spectacle of multinational vultures and millionaire tax exiles vying with each other to snap up the fixed line business? Is that the Taoiseach's vision of the future of crucial services? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach or the Government learned from the give-away of the natural gas resources in the Corrib Field to Enterprise Oil with not a penny in royalties and scarcely any tax accruing after write-offs for expenses? Does the Taoiseach agree that, instead of proceeding as the OECD <Col N="1059" /> recommends, it would be better to develop and democratise the public services, including opening the ESB to more influence by the workers, consumers and the public? Does he accept this would be a preferable way to develop our services rather than again throwing them into the den of the multinational companies, the financial conglomerates and so on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever happens in the ESB or any other State company should be done in conjunction with the workers, management and trade union representatives. They should work out what they believe to be to the best strategic advantage of their company. The Government would have a role to play in that.</P>
      <P>Regulatory reform is important and the Government, Departments and agencies have worked on it over the past years. It is not an issue that can be prepared and executed overnight. The Government is committed to better regulation because we recognise that excessive or poor quality State regulation would be an unnecessary burden on economic and social activity. We recognise that if State regulation is excessive in quantity or poor in quality it will be an unnecessary burden on economic and social activity, as much on the latter as on the former. The approach to regulatory reform adopted by the Government is a pragmatic one and is not driven by any ideology. In its report the OECD clearly points out that there is a difference between deregulation and regulatory reform and the differences and distinctions make a great deal of sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulatory reform is important because of the contribution it can make in sustaining economic growth and competitiveness. The National Competitiveness Council in its reports of recent years has highlighted the need for such reform which it believes also help to achieve efficiencies in a non-inflationary way. Regulators are now facing a very different set of challenges to those faced in the recent decades. The economic challenges we now face are to do with capacity of the electricity infrastructure, competitiveness, counter-inflationary pressures and economic performance, so a reform of these things is important as is regulatory reform to achieve success in doing that. The OECD report points out, as has the SMI group over the past eight years, we can free up markets, minimise regulatory barriers to business and innovation, promote greater competition to benefit the consumer and simplify the regulatory environment to boost trade and foreign investment. This is not an attempt to simply throw out every rule and regulation there to protect people. If we achieve these things it will only be through agreement, as with most things in life particularly those affecting workers, management and Government. That is what the OECD and the people who have worked on this over the years have emphasised. This will go forward over a fairly prolonged period with some areas being <Col N="1060" /> obvious, and Deputy Quinn has already highlighted them. Other areas are also being looked at and still others are more complicated, but the process makes sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Would the Taoiseach acknowledge that, in spite of the massive economic growth of recent years, there has been no investment in plant for electricity provision? That is why last year the ESB had to bring in five emergency generators from Chicago, just to keep the home fires burning. What steps are to be taken in view of the seven year run-in period from the time a decision is made to generation and transmission? Is the Taoiseach aware of the DKM report's warning that unless immediate action is taken there is a very real possibility of a flight of digital capital? The websites he mentioned, the data-hosting centres, will not alone be unable to get the power they require, they will leave and go to places where there is a guaranteed source of power.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority is a key instrument in ensuring there are not any anti-competitive practices. Last year Deloitte and Touche reported the authority to be very under-resourced and in need of an immediate increase in its staff level from 29 to 44. The report went to the Department of Finance and I want to know if there has been any response from it regarding the provision of the additional staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is the Minister to answer those lead questions. I will not answer them other than to say I am sure the Deputy will accept that the ESB, with the support of the Minister, has put enormous resources into its capital infrastructure and continues to do so. That has to continue.</P>
      <P>I cannot say if the Competition Authority has got all of its staff, though additional people have been recruited. On the issue of the websites, the webfarms as they are known, the phenomenon is a new one and the ESB is endeavouring to cope as best it can. We can deal with a certain amount of them, but perhaps it would not be desirable if the country was full of them because they are not big employers. However, they are important as part of the industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, but there are many reasons they have come to this country. We have some of the most advanced legislation since last year and many other facilities, which suits them. Technology companies will continue to come here. One can have a certain number of webfarms. The ESB can cope with the extension of growth in the economy, but no one, including the ESB, could deal with a huge number of webfarms. There is also a location issue. The ESB has done its best to deal with them to date and <Col N="1061" /> there have not been any disappointments. The ESB is conscious in its plans and surveys for the next seven years of being able to deal with these issues, but it will require an enormous amount of investment. It has grown by 10% every year for the past seven or eight years. This has not happened in many electricity companies in Europe, let alone anywhere else. The ESB is doing its utmost to cope with the situation, but more capital investment is desirable and necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the promise in the Taoiseach's statement regarding a national policy statement on regulatory reform, when will it become available for debate and discussion in the House or nationally? The Taoiseach said in the same statement on 25 April that the Tánaiste had asked the Competition Authority to undertake a review of the legislation covering pharmacies. When will this review be completed? Will a decision be made known about the liberalisation of the regulations preventing proper competition among existing chemist shops and also restricting other European nationals from coming here and providing a service which, in some cases, we cannot obtain ourselves? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the second question, the review of the health community pharmacy contract arrangements which the Government awarded to general medical services is ongoing. However, the Tánaiste has asked for it to be accelerated, which means that it will not be too long before it is completed. Work has been done on this matter before. I do not have a date, but I understand it will be completed fairly soon.</P>
      <P>As regards the recommendations which will be put together in a national paper on the issue, the high level group will draft it as soon as it starts to meet. It will be its first job under its terms of reference. The group working on the matter for the past few years would have views on how it should be done. It will not take long to put together a national paper. There are 14 different bodies &ndash; seven Departments, the Office of the Attorney General, Forfás, the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, the Commission on Electricity Regulation and the Commission on Aviation Regulation. They will all have an input into it. I have met a number of times most of the group which worked on the priorities in recent years with the OECD. It is clear about the national paper. I hope the position paper will be prepared and circulated during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I heard the Taoiseach correctly when he said the OECD was not ideologically driven. Today's editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> suggests that the OECD normally takes a pro-market line. That would be the view of many. I assume the Taoiseach agrees with the OECD's recommendation to shift the focus away from tax on human labour to a tax on the consumption of <Col N="1062" /> finite energy and resources. I wager the Government will not do anything to reform taxation along those lines, notwithstanding promises that it will be tackled in the next budget. It will be interesting to see what action is taken.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned deregulation and increased competition, and the OECD recommends market liberalisation for electricity and gas consumers by 2005 or sooner. Does he accept that the limited work done by the ESB on energy demand control will be totally undone by deregulation of the energy sector? That sector has one objective &ndash; to sell as much energy as it is possible to generate. Does the Taoiseach accept that energy conservation is not being properly tackled by the Government because taxation is not being reformed, and because there has not been a replacement of the energy conservation measures taken by the ESB when the energy sector was fully regulated?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked this before. There should be a shift away, and this is likely to happen. Moving in that direction will be beneficial. There have been many inventions around the world and a move in the right direction will see increased benefits in energy conservation, along the lines Deputy Sargent has suggested. The Deputy has made similar points over several years but modern research has shown that a reformed tax base can help to efficiently conserve energy in ways that are not damaging to the world economy. That is the way the world will go. How quickly it will move in that direction is another issue.</P>
      <P>It appears to be a slow process, if the example of the bigger economies is taken. However, the age of buying out people with ideas, and attempting to knock those people off course, is gone. Energy conservation is now big business. I heard recently that if a particular company got its way, it could take 2,000 cars off the road&mdash;</P>

      <P>The penultimate recommendation in the OECD report advocates the establishment of a high level committee to protect the regulatory system, while the final recommendation advises strengthening the accountability of regulators through overview by parliamentary committee. I stand open to correction, but I understood the Taoiseach's earlier reply to mean the assistant secretary level committee in his Department is aimed at developing policy for the national platform in relation to regulation. The recommendations to which I refer call for something different. Is the Taoiseach in favour of establishing a single regulatory authority that would combine the functions of the telecommunications regulator, the regulator who will be appointed in respect of the energy sector and the regulators in any other sectors that may move from State monopoly ownership into a regulatory system? Given that resources are limited and that there is a need for consistency in the application, streamlining and integration of legislation, and given the size of the Irish market and the economy, does the Taoiseach agree there is a compelling argument in favour of the establishment of a well-resourced regulatory commission consisting of more than just one wise person upon whom all responsibility will devolve in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, as his colleague and friend, the former Attorney General and current EU Commissioner for Consumer Affairs, <Col N="1064" /> stated in a speech to a law gathering, the demographic deficit of accountability that has opened up with the transfer of responsibility for State owned companies, such as those in the telecommunications, energy and other sectors, into a competitive market system, has removed any form of parliamentary accountability on the floor of this House in respect of the role of the regulator? Will he outline the precise intention of the Government in this regard, because this is not made clear either in his statement on 25 April or in his initial reply to these questions? What is the Government's attitude to the establishment of an office of regulator, which would combine functions, pool resources and provide for consistency of interpretation and rulings? In what way does the Taoiseach believe that office of regulator should be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas? He will recall there was an occasion on which the telecommunications regulator refused to come before a committee of the House on the grounds that the legislation did not require her to so do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a number of points. First, the objective of the high level group on regulation &ndash; which will work only on regulatory reform &ndash; will be to provide a cross-agency mechanism to examine the findings of the OECD's report, to consider existing and emerging implementation plans, to report to the Government and to follow the progress that is being made over a period. The main issues, of which there are three of note, are consideration of options for a model of regulatory impact analysis in the public service; availing of the composition of the group to identify inhibitions to the development of a coherent cross-sectoral system of regulatory management; and consideration of institutional and policy responses to the recommendations. Membership of the high level group will include the various regulators &ndash; the telecommunications regulator, the electricity regulator and the aviation regulator.</P>
      <P>In my statement on 24 April and in my initial reply today, I indicated that I had written to the chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on SMI to ask it to study the report and to deal with this issue so that, as the national statement on regulatory reform is brought forward along with other issues, a report would be made to a committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the third point regarding the question asked by the now Commissioner and then Attorney General of who regulates the regulators, while the issue with which we were dealing at the time has been resolved, any regulator should be answerable to a committee of the House. It does not make sense to remove functions from State agencies, boards or management and give them to a person who is not answerable to the House. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, had to deal with the issue to which I referred, and the point made by the regulator in that instance <Col N="1065" /> was that the legislation did not require regulators to report to the House. I believe they should.</P>
    <P>On the final point about whether all the regulators should be amalgamated into one regulator's office, while I do not deal directly with this issue, I understand that is not something which has merit at this stage. Regulators are new to the system and different ones deal with different areas. While I presume the format of the legislation establishing them is similar, having them work together in a regulation office is not seen as the way to proceed because they deal with different industries, whatever roles they may have in future. The point made by Commissioner Byrne at the time was that Parliament was giving away its powers which were tied down in Gas Acts, ESB Acts and other legislation and that the people to whom those powers were being given were not answerable to Parliament and were independent of Ministers and Departments. I understand the electricity and gas regulators will have to answer to committees of the House and that should at least resolve the problem in those cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach is not suggesting the Strategic Management Committee is the body to which the regulators would be accountable as set out in recommendation No. 9 of the OECD report. Does he agree a select committee of the House, either the Committee of Public Accounts or a committee of that nature established on a proper statutory basis to be clearly seen as the body to which all regulators, either individually or collectively depending on whether a single body is established, should report? The Taoiseach's reply does not deal with that. If I am correct in understanding what he said, he merely asked the committee chaired by Deputy Roche to examine the OECD report and not to position itself to be the committee to which the regulators would be accountable, which is a different matter altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about a regulator's committee but about a high level committee on regulatory reform which will deal with the implementation of the OECD report. The committee to which the Deputy referred, which began its work only a short while ago, has taken an interest on behalf of the House in the strategic management initiative. Regulators, whether they deal with the gas, electricity or telecommunications industries, have a separate role and function and should report to the relevant committee which deals with their areas, all of which come under the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the accepted difficulties with current and future electricity supply, is the Taoiseach satisfied deregulation has been allowed to create much alternative energy? Only 50 MW are available through wind and other alternative energy generation whereas, in Denmark, 2,000 MW are available and the Danes <Col N="1066" /> expect by 2010 to generate half their supply using alternative energy. Is the Taoiseach also satisfied that enough support is being given by regulation to the production of electricity through biomass? This is a major and important issue in my area and other areas along the Border.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that the OECD recommendation that electricity generation capacity should be given over to private interests is irresponsible in environmental terms? Is he aware that many of the companies which would want to generate electricity would do so through waste to energy systems, in other words incineration? This form of generating electricity is not only an incentive to continue waste mountains in the interest of creating more profit for the operators, it will also result in environmental pollution. Will the Taoiseach state his opposition to this trend, in view of the need to reduce greenhouse gases? The thrust of the OECD recommendations with regard to greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland is quite irresponsible. Is the Taoiseach aware that in other surveys the OECD has argued that Ireland should trade the right to use the emission capacity of other countries instead of going in the direction of cutting down waste? Does he agree that we should be going in the direction of environmental protection? Does he also agree with the alternative motion proposed today at the Coillte Teoranta AGM that the annual broadleaf planting rate should be extended from 6% to 50%, according to the Heritage Council's recommendations, in order to begin to address the problem of greenhouse gases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it is engaged in selling all remaining State companies as quickly as possible, it is difficult to believe the Taoiseach when he says the Government is not ideologically driven. The Green Party is driven by the principles of sustainability and social equity. Does the Taoiseach agree that ecological tax reform has already been successfully put in place in many Scandinavian countries and throughout the world and does not require an agreed plan whereby every country would introduce such tax reform simultaneously? It is possible for a country to do so unilaterally and remain competitive at the same time. The ESRI has recommended this. When will the Government put this change into effect rather than producing rhetoric and press statements saying it will happen in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Taoiseach answer the argument from Éircom and the ESB that there is no deregulation but that the Government is merely telling these companies they must sell out to millionaires in order to make these millionaires even more wealthy? How does he answer the <Col N="1067" /> argument that private companies are selling electricity to their customers cheaper than the ESB can sell it and that infrastructure put in place by the taxpayer is being sold in order to make people even richer than they already are? Éircom and the ESB are making these claims and have been put in a position where they are unable to compete. Will the same thing happen with mobile phone licences? Will wealthy people be allowed to buy something provided by the taxpayer? </P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been and continues to be supportive of investment in the forestry industry. It is particularly supportive of the planting of broadleaf trees. There is already private investment in wind energy. Most of the wind energy capacity has been produced by private companies, an area into which the ESB will expand. The board has already done its own research on it and been involved in the County Donegal wind energy project. I am sure it will continue to invest in wind energy if it makes sense to do so. As regards Deputy Sargent's point, Denmark is a good example of how it works.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No date. As regards deregulation, we will be pinned on some dates in that area because in future there will be decisions on European issues concerning it. While I know the Deputy is asking me a question about the deregulation argument, rather than just stating a fact, enormous advances have occurred in the telecoms market because we have moved on deregulation. That is what opened up the market to huge advances that have taken place. People say that where capital investment is concerned people are making money and I know there are large players in this market that would not otherwise have been there. However, the decision to bring forward deregulation earlier than the planned date, is what has driven the market successfully. International market fluctuations affect these issues but deregulation has been helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the ESB, it is not just a question of the taxpayers but of the entire staff who should have a new relationship with their own company and see rewards from it. I am totally in favour of that. I do not see why ESB workers should not have a chance for advancement in the modernisation and capitalisation of their company. We now have a regulator for the electricity industry which will attract private investment under a <Col N="1068" /> changed structure. It will be done by passing legislation in this House and whatever happens in the negotiations with the workers, I hope there will be a stake in it for the public as well. It will be a good day for such companies.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 4,000 Parliamentary Questions were answered by the Minister for Health and Children during the year 2000. The volume of questions so far in 2001 would indicate that a total of similar proportions can be anticipated this year. In a single month the number of questions answered can be as high as 656. This represents the highest total of questions answered by any Minister or Department and I make the point that the headquarters staffing of the Department of Health and Children is not large, relatively speaking. Also, the preparation of responses to Parliamentary Questions, which is always given due priority by the Department, is one of many pressing demands on the limited staffing resources of the Department.</P>
      <P>This is the context within which the approach to various types of Parliamentary Questions is adopted. In general, questions break down into three types: those which are properly for the Department and where the necessary information is readily to hand; questions which are proper to the Department but which require further research and data collection; and questions on issues which are quite clearly a matter for local management of health boards or the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Minister and the Department in each case is to be as helpful and informative as possible, bearing in mind the overall limitations on staff time and the need for efficient use of public resources in addressing the Department's extensive brief.</P>
      <P>In the case of the question referred to by the Deputy, all of the information required was not readily available. To ensure that the reply was both accurate and comprehensive, considerable research and consultation was required. The final reply to the Deputy was issued at the earliest date by which these criteria could be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the timing of the reply, I will comment on its content. Far from being a symptom of paralysis, as the Deputy has suggested elsewhere, I would regard it as a great strength of policy making by my Department that it engages in a considerable degree of consultation and in-<Col N="1069" /> depth analysis of issues. Public policy-making is no longer the preserve of a select few politicians and senior civil servants. Contemporary models of public management quite deliberately emphasise the importance of consultation and a partnership approach and I make no apology for observing the principles of participative decision making in discharging my role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Standing Order requires a parliamentary question to be answered in three sitting days, not on 11 May 2001, after a number of rows on the floor of the House? Is it not a fact that because there are, according to the Minister's reply, 55 such reviews, groups and bodies, and his civil servants are too tied up with sticking-plaster approaches to policy to keep the Minister's backside covered, they cannot do what they are supposed to and answer parliamentary questions tabled in this House? Would the Minister further agree that the list is not only not comprehensive but also misleading? Where in the list is there mention of the work force planning study on therapists, the Deloitte and Touche value-for-money review, the tribunals of inquiry, and the working group on needs assessment for carers and care recipients? With all his civil servants and more reviews than Heinz have products, I have not been able to get an accurate reply from the Minister in six weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a huge meal out of something that does not deserve the kind of attention and activity he has been engaged in, such as invoking Standing Order 31. That is a bit of a joke. It was a fairly routine parliamentary question and if the Deputy had difficulties in obtaining answers, he could have telephoned me or contacted me in the normal way so that we could have inquired into the matter. The Deputy did not do so, however, because all he was interested in was creating hype around something that did not merit that kind of hype.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are not Mickey Mouse review groups. I attended all the recent conferences held by public servants' organisations working in the health sector, including the various nursing unions and IMPACT. All these organisations are represented on a range of groups dealing, for example, with implementing the recommendations of the nursing commission. By any objective assessment, that marks a milestone in the way we treat nurses within the health service. Is Deputy Mitchell saying we should abolish all those sub-groups and advisory fora? Is he sug<Col N="1070" /> gesting we should get rid of the monitoring committee responsible for implementing the recommendations of the nursing commission? Is he suggesting that we should get rid of the national cancer forum and a variety of groups that have advised us effectively on a whole range of areas?</P>
    <P>Health is a complex sector and it evolves in terms of consultative and advisory groups, bringing on board other representatives from a range of organisations. The list is exhaustive but if there are some omissions I regret that and will make sure we can add to it. However, I do not accept the basic proposition of the Deputy that these review bodies should be abolished; they certainly should not. They were part of the system for quite a long time before I arrived in my present position. In fact, Deputy Mitchell's own party leader established a number of those groups when he was Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in regard to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, The Expenditure Review of the Subvention Scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the six health boards concerned that the amounts repaid are as follows:</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept it is quite startling that the total amount repaid according to him is only approximately £1 million, given that the Ombudsman estimated £4 million was owing to the elderly because the health boards had been acting as pickpockets, illegally taking money from their pensions? Surely he cannot seriously say this is satisfactory, particularly when the Minister for Health and Children stated when the report was published three months ago the matter would be dealt with without delay. When will the outstanding money be paid to old age pensioners? Can the Minister of State assure us the money will not be diverted again? This is the second time an attempt has been made to ensure elderly people are given back the money to which they are entitled. The health boards diverted the money in some cases when the first attempt was made. What does the Government intend to do in regard to the families of old age pensioners in nursing homes who are subventing their care? The Ombudsman has found that should not have been the case. What does the Minister of State intend to do in terms of repaying the money owed to them? Rather than setting up another structure, how soon will this happen and how much is involved?</P>

There were some delays initially but we have gone back to the health boards and asked them to expedite any remaining moneys that need to be repaid as quickly as possible. More than £1.25 million has been returned and there is less than £750,000 to be paid out. The money was never diverted to any other area. It was intended for and given to the elderly.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet committee is considering the fifth progress report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, dealing with the issue of abortion. It is not possible at this stage to indicate a timescale for the completion of the committee's work.</P>
      <P>The all-party committee's proposals regarding crisis pregnancies are also being examined. While in principle the Government is committed to an approach along the lines set out in the report, considerable preparatory work will need to be undertaken before a plan such as that proposed can be put in place. Work is under way in my Department on appropriate arrangements for the establishment of an agency such as that proposed by the all-party committee. It would be the task of this agency, when established, to prepare a national plan to combat crisis pregnancy and oversee its implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated he is well disposed towards an agency, which is progress of a sort.

What progress has been made? Are there differing views among the members of the Cabinet sub-committee?

Regarding the agency, we have prepared a statutory instrument under the Health (Corporate Bodies) <Col N="1074" /> Act, 1961, on which I am seeking further legal advice.

We are seeking further legal advice on the matter from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>With regard to the substantive issue, the sub-committee is comprised of representatives of both partners in Government. We are proceeding on an agreed basis and making progress. We are working on the options presented in the concluding chapter of the all-party committee's report. We are examining them but have reached no definitive conclusions on the substantive issues.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding waiting times for assessment for domestic adoption and intercountry adoption are very different and I will deal with them separately.</P>
      <P>The number of domestic adoptions, other than family adoptions, has decreased enormously in recent years, from a high of 1,287 in 1975 to only 90 adoption orders in 1999 in respect of children placed with families by adoption agencies. In some cases an adoption agency might only place two or three children in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> Agencies generally assess a small number of couples based on their estimate of the number of children likely to become available for adoption but there is no guarantee that a couple on the domestic waiting list will ever have a child placed with them. The health boards normally advise couples that they may like to opt for intercountry adoption instead.</P>
    <P>The number of applications for assessment for intercountry adoptions has been increasing steadily over the past five years. In 1998 and 1999, there were respectively 680 and 623 applications. In 2000, however, the number was 1,045, which is a 68% increase.</P>
    <P>In view of the difficulties being experienced by couples wishing to be assessed for suitability to adopt from abroad, significant funding was provided to the boards to help them provide a speedier, more efficient service. In 1999 and 2000, £1 million in total additional funding was allocated, and provision for an additional £360,000 has been made available in this year's Estimates. In addition, last year I launched a standardised framework for assessment which is now being used in all health boards to streamline the assessment process and to provide a more transparent system. That has resulted in a reduction of waiting times in all boards. The waiting time for first time assessment in the ERHA stood at 36 to 42 months at the end of June 2000, and I understand from the authority that by the end of December it had fallen to 18 to 24 months.</P>
    <P>The assessment and waiting times vary across the boards. The information provided by the boards indicates that waiting times in the Eastern Regional Health Authority are 18 to 24 months, in the Mid-Western Health Board they are 18 months, in the South Eastern Health Board they are 12 to 14 months, in the Southern Health Board they are 14 to 16 months, in the NEHB they are eight to ten months, in the Midland Health Board they are 12 to 25 months, and in the North Western Health Board and the Western Health Board they are only six to eight months.</P>
    <P>Because assessments must be carried out by qualified social workers, the numbers of those have increased from 17.5 full-time equivalents in 1988 to a current high of 42 but I am aware that the health boards are having difficulty filling their full complement and a recommendation of the National Social Workers Qualifications Board has been taken on board this year where extra places will be provided in the training colleges over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. The Minister mentioned the waiting times for assessment. Is she aware that, particularly in relation to intercountry adoptions, persons who have already adopted one child and have been assessed have to go through the whole procedure again from start to finish? That puts a major gap between children who are available for adoption and loving parents who have been <Col N="1077" /> found to be suitable in carrying through the adoption. Will the Minister of State ensure, taking into account the need to protect the child's interests in particular, that there is no unnecessary bureaucratic duplication in the way the whole process of intercountry assessment is carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 1,045 I mentioned, 107 of those are people awaiting second assessment so we have arranged that persons applying for a second assessment would be fast-tracked and that each social worker who is undertaking first assessments will also undertake a number of second assessments so that those couples do not have to wait an unduly long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>We saw recently in both England and America the case of children who were bought on the Internet. What is the Government doing to ensure that could not happen here? We saw what happened in that case in terms of court cases. Two beautiful children were displayed on television and elsewhere. I want to know what the Government is doing to ensure that could not happen here because it was outrageous to see children being bought. What action has the Minister of State taken in recent months since that happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody here, we abhor any practice which would involve the sale of children on the Internet or otherwise. We are satisfied that our tight legislation, coupled with our strict customs procedures and observance, will mean that children cannot be bought over the airwaves, cannot be given to couples who have not been assessed and cannot be registered here by the Adoption Board so that the rights of the children are protected here. Obviously it is something we are keeping constantly under review and it is an area which will be strengthened when we ratify the Hague Convention. I propose to take the heads of a Bill in relation to that matter to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and non-acute sectors on foot of the commitment by the Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is now at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future. Preliminary indications are that the review estimates that approximately 5,000 beds will need to be provided over a ten year period to 2011.</P>
      <P>At a special meeting on 14 May, the Government discussed a wide variety of issues and concerns in the health service, ranging from primary care through all aspects of health care. Discussions on hospital services primarily focused on the emerging need to increase bed capacity.</P>
      <P>Overall hospital waiting list figures have gone down by almost 25% since December 1999. The waiting list for orthopaedics and ophthalmology reduced by 29% and 27% respectively over the past year. Notwithstanding these reductions, I am concerned at the number of people still awaiting surgery. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures, and a further £34.5 million has been provided for 2001 to achieve further reductions in waiting lists. The overall target is to ensure that no adult will wait more than 12 months and that no child will wait more than six months for treatment.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, this Government is committed to investing £1 billion to improve acute hospital facilities and to enhance the capacity of the sector to respond to increased demand for services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The bottom line is that last year, as a result of the commitment in the PPF, the Government commissioned the first objective, scientifically-based study of bed capacity, projecting up to and beyond 2011, and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The preliminary results were presented to the meeting last week. A more comprehensive presentation will be made to Cabinet in the form of memoranda and so on, but the indications are that 5,000 beds will be needed <Col N="1080" /> over the ten year period up to 2011. That is a significant challenge for the health service as it is not just a matter of putting beds into wards, but of providing the necessary backup and so on. The question asked for a figure and I have replied accurately.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the booklet, Media Guidelines on Portrayal of Suicide, by the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14850/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The booklet <i>Media Guidelines on the Portrayal of Suicide</i> was published jointly by the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology in January 2000. Suicide is now a major public health problem. Although the number of deaths attributed to suicide is still high, I am pleased to inform the House that the 413 deaths from suicide in 2000 represents a decrease on both the 1999 figure of 439 and the 1998 figure of 504. While these figures are encouraging, suicide remains the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds in Ireland, exceeding deaths due to cancer and road traffic accidents. A disturbing feature is the significant number of male suicides, in particular young men and men aged 65 years.</P>
      <P>Media coverage of suicidal behaviour should project an objective yet preventive message, as well as educate and inform the public about the subject. It is felt that by providing the public with information about the warning signs of suicide, how to help, who to call, and where to get help, the media could help prevent potential suicides by providing a positive and preventive message to balance the story.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that organisations like the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology should co-operate in the production of guidelines for the portrayal of suicide in the media. The guidelines have been produced to help those working in the media in this area. They do not seek to dictate, rather they hope to offer some help to the journalist in resolving his or her own professional, and sometimes personal, dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past there was an understandable reluctance to even discuss the issue of suicide. This situation is now changing. In general, the media has been sensitive in its reporting of suicides. There is evidence to suggest that sensitive reporting may have a positive influence on those <Col N="1082" /> people at risk of suicide and I fully support the publication of the guidelines on the portrayal of suicide in the media.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree that certain types of media reporting can have the opposite effect to that suggested by him in that they can encourage copycat suicides as they glamorise or sensationalise suicide? Such coverage refers to the suicide of high profile people who might be deemed leaders of society or of their peer groups, whether pop singers and so on. Such reporting can have a contagion effect whereby it can lead to suicides.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's comments on the effects of positive media coverage and it is important that the media treats suicide in the manner he has outlined. However, there is concern regarding the manner in which some reporting effects those who are feeling suicidal and bereaved families when they see the suicide of their loved ones depicted in a sensationalised manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's comments. Having attended a number of seminars given by experts I accept that the danger of copycat suicides is a real issue of which the media and educators generally have to be extremely careful. We also have to be conscious of the bereaved. Organisations have been established to comfort the bereaved. Any public commentary or media treatment of suicide must take extreme care and show sensitivity to the bereaved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree we should not leave it to the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology to make all the running regarding media standards? Does he further agree there may be some merit in appointing a designated officer in the Department who would automatically write to the press when it crosses the line by reporting suicides in such a way as to possibly contribute to the incidence of suicide? Does he see a role for his Department in this regard, or does he think it should be left entirely to non-governmental organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to consider that issue. Non-governmental organisations, such as the Irish Association of Suicidology and the Samaritans, have a significant role to play as they possess expertise in this area. People come and go and are promoted within the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These structural changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board received an additional investment of £813,000 in 2001 under the initiative. The board's proposals include the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists, the commissioning of four additional orthodontic chairs in the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital, the development of new orthodontic units in Tralee and the north side of Cork city and the validation of waiting lists. I have also funded a full professorial post in the Cork Dental School and Hospital to facilitate the development of a programme of specialist training in orthodontics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has advised me that the consultant orthodontist for the Tralee orthodontic unit will provide orthodontic services to County Kerry and <Col N="1084" /> parts of west Cork. The recruitment process for this post is currently in train. Qualifications for the post are at present being cleared with the training and regulatory bodies and I am informed that this process will be completed by the end of May, at which stage the post will be formally advertised.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a three and a half year wait in County Kerry for orthodontic treatment? It is one of the longest waiting times in the country. Approximately 1,000 young people in Kerry are awaiting treatment. The Minister will surely agree that this is not fair. Young people are now more conscious than ever of their appearance and the wait for treatment is affecting their self esteem and personalities. Will the Minister give a precise indication of when the consultant orthodontist for County Kerry will be appointed? It could be a long process as it might be difficult to recruit a consultant orthodontist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the waiting lists are too long. They were particularly long in Dublin and Cork so I took steps to deal with them in the context of the Estimates last year. My November reply indicated that I was providing funds to the health boards, having asked all of them to come forward with short-term initiatives to reduce the waiting lists. The health boards did so and we provided funding for the plans they submitted.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board's plan involves the recruitment of two additional consultants. Both posts have been submitted to the local appointments commission to be advertised. Obviously, I do not control that process. The commission will advertise the posts in the normal way. I understand the advertisements will be published in May but it will be some time after that before the person is in place. Additional facilities and a new regional orthodontic unit will be established in Tralee. There is a substantial investment in improving orthodontic services in Kerry for the first time in a long time although, admittedly, it might be a few months before the person is in place.</P>
      <P>Recently I had further discussions with the health board to ensure that the funding I allocated will be spent this year to ensure the waiting lists are reduced.</P>

I asked the health boards to come forward with plans and I allocated funding to them to implement the plans. I will evaluate the status of their plans in the next few weeks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has from time to time been asked to regulate the activities of persons providing body piercing and tattooing services. The approach being adopted is to prepare <Col N="1087" /> good practice guidelines for practitioners rather than draw up specific regulations. It is intended that these guidelines will serve to assist environmental health officers in their inspection of premises under the infectious diseases regulations. It is also intended to produce an advice and information leaflet for the general public about the possible risks attached to body piercing and tattooing.</P>
      <P>Under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, health boards are empowered, where there is reason to believe that a probable source of infection exists, to carry out an investigation and to take such steps as are necessary or desirable to investigate the nature and source of such infection, to prevent the spread of such infection and to remove conditions favourable to infection. While a considerable amount of work has been undertaken to date, the guidelines are not yet finalised.</P>
      <P>Further consideration of the issues involved and further consultation with appropriate interested parties is necessary before my Department will be in a position to bring the guidelines to completion. Due to other competing demands it is not possible at this stage to put a time frame on the completion of these guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably wished Deputy McCreevy's mouth was stapled when he came out of Ballymascanlon some weeks ago. The Minister informed the House on 15 November last year that he would bring forward an information leaflet. That has not been done. He also said he would bring forward guidelines but neither has that been done.</P>
      <P>Will he accept that he has shown a degree of lethargy on this subject, given the medical evidence from general practitioners of grotesque infections occurring in young people who have used body piercing and tattooing services in this city? Will he further accept that parental consent should be required for young people under a certain age before such practices are permitted? Will he also accept that the spread of infection, specifically HIV and hepatitis B, is increased dramatically due to the piercing guns used in such operations? Minor surgeries, for which doctors do not require licences, are being performed in parts of this city; anyone can open a body piercing salon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This area must be regulated. On 15 November, the Minister stated he would address this issue but, eight months later, we are still waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1088" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many areas require regulation. We are concentrating on the paramedics area but one could also mention physiotherapy, speech therapy, counselling etc. The entire allied health professionals field is unregulated. These professionals provide services for thousands, if not millions, of people throughout the country. Our objective, <i>via </i>our business plan, is to provide a statutory regulatory framework for allied health professionals and we are well on the way to achieving this. We hope to be in a position to publish the heads of a Bill in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The second area of priority which I signalled in terms of regulations relates to alternative and traditional medicines. I have met practitioners and service providers involved in this field and they welcome the concept of regulation. They are interested in the model being drawn up for the allied health professionals. If we could resolve the issue of a regulatory framework for allied health professionals, we could extend that model into the area of traditional and alternative medicine and also examine its usefulness in regard to body piercing etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept it is unsatisfactory that this issue is so far down the Department's list of priorities? If one owns a dog, one must have a licence for it, yet it is possible to open a tattoo parlour or a body piercing salon in which invasive procedures, which carry the risk of HIV, hepatitis, syphilis or TB infection, can be carried out in the absence of any regulation whatsoever. Surely this area could be regulated in parallel with work on other priority areas &ndash; I acknowledge that allied health professionals and alternative and traditional medicine practitioners must also be registered and regulated. The registration of these practitioners will be a huge task and the Minister will probably be an old age pensioner when it is concluded. His successor may eventually address the issue of body piercing which will probably be outmoded. This is a serious issue and the Minister should treat it seriously as the lack of regulation can adversely affect very young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The same language could be employed in regard to other unregulated areas such as allied health professionals, traditional and complementary medicines etc. &ndash; these areas are unregulated to a far greater degree throughout the country than is the area of body piercing. The Department would prefer to go the route of issuing guidelines in this area. Under the infectious diseases regulations of 1981, the health boards are empowered to investigate premises in which body piercing is carried out. I will take on board Members' views on this matter but, as I stated, we would prefer to issue guidelines in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a case to immediately ban piercing guns, as distinct from needles? He referred to infectious diseases; has any assessment been carried <Col N="1089" /> out of the potential for the transmission of such diseases through body piercing, given the recent rise of HIV infection among heterosexuals? Is the age of consent applied in regard to these procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there is a risk of diseases such as AIDS being transmitted through this activity. The issues of the age of consent and informed consent are being examined.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal to guillotine legislation which will effectively give the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the discretionary power to decide whether a returning Irish national who married a foreign national and lived abroad for some years will have the automatic right to citizenship or if it will be granted at the discretion of the Minister. It is an outrageous invasion of privacy and stripping away of the rights of Irish citizens.

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a measure of the Taoiseach's utter determination to press ahead with the Stadium Ireland project at any cost that it took a freedom of information request to establish the facts. Why, when we were debating this issue last May, did he or the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, not inform the House that the Government had been advised by the Department of Finance through the Minister for Finance that the estimated cost of the stadium was probably £100 million more than the figures given in the House? The House was also not informed that there was little likelihood of private investors getting involved because there would not be a return on their investment. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation misled the House, and the Taoiseach, by standing over the figures, also misled the House.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Stadium Ireland project said this morning on the radio that the tendering process was continuing and that the bids would be presented to the Cabinet for approval in July. I understood that when the Tánaiste prevailed on the Taoiseach to do a full financial review of the project tenders would not be evaluated or accepted and that further contractual obligations would not be entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Noonan said. In light of the ambiguity which surrounds this project and the apparent lack of openness by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Taoiseach and others, will the independent audit of this project and the value for money audit be truly independent? Instead of hiring cost consultants in the private sector at a considerable cost whose terms of reference could be written in a particular way to ensure a favourable outcome &ndash; it would not be the first time &ndash; is the Government prepared to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is an independent person answerable to this House, to undertake the value for money audit that he is empowered to do before any contractual commitments are made on behalf of the taxpayers? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided on 1 May to undertake an independent overview of the costs and benefits of the Stadium Ireland project. That will be the second overview because the first professional estimate of the cost of the project was provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the feasibility study. That is the figure the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Stadium Ireland and I have used. The next professional analysis of the cost will be provided by the bidding process, which is currently under way. In the meantime, the Government at the beginning of this month decided to hire independent consultants to provide an overview to assist in determining the final Exchequer allocation to the project. That overview will assess the benefits as well as the costs of the development, the attendant infrastructural work and the upgrading of existing <Col N="1097" /> facilities in Abbotstown. The consultants, who have yet to be selected, will be required to complete the overview within three months. The Government will then make its decision on how best to proceed with this project. The consultants will work with a steering group of senior officials which will include the Departments of Finance, Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Taoiseach and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Noonan's other point about internal notes in the Department of Finance, the Department of Finance's internal note on the possible costs of the sports campus project significantly predates the decision to have an independent evaluation of the costs and benefits of the project.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance note also predates the meeting with Campus Ireland in March of this year, at which it gave a presentation on the stadium and campus project. I attended with the Tánaiste and senior officials, including officials from the Department of Finance. At that stage, Campus Ireland also gave its views on transport and other issues. These issues are now part of the examination.</P>
      <P>In 1992, PriceWaterhouse Coopers examined whether Ireland should have a national stadium. There was a further examination more recently, which I have just mentioned, and now we are to have a third examination of the issue. It is not reasonable for Deputy Quinn to complain of a group of senior officials from a number of Departments deciding who will do the job, without involvement from me. I am unconcerned who gets the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation <Col N="1098" /> will continue with the development of excellent sporting facilities throughout the country, as he has done for all sports for the past four years.

      <P>In a debate in the House in the first week of May, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation rebutted arguments that Stadium Ireland was on the way to costing £1 billion. In doing that, he did not reveal that the Minister for Finance was advised that the potential cost of the stadium was £100 million more than had been originally estimated by PriceWaterhouse Coopers. He did not reveal that there was a serious doubt about the project attracting any private investment other than the original £50 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach apologise to the House on behalf of his Minister? Will he correct the record <Col N="1099" /> and will he guarantee that contracts are not entered into until the financial evaluation takes place? I draw the Taoiseach's attention to advertisements placed in the national press last week concerning the move of the State laboratory and other facilities. The advertisements for contracts said that work is expected to commence in August 2001 and talked of a commitment of £200 million. Will the Tánaiste sit quietly and take this?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government received a draft Bill to put beyond challenge the right of the Oireachtas to conduct an inquiry into matters of public interest? Will he confirm that he received that Bill two weeks ago and that he was informed by the Government Chief Whip of the absolute necessity to have the Bill sponsored, in order to address the issue of the competence of committees of inquiry from this House to conduct their business? Does the Taoiseach accept he has failed to enable the Bill to be processed by the Attorney General, who could not offer a view because it was left without a sponsor? Not even the Taoiseach's Department was prepared to sponsor the Bill and the Department of Finance refused to consider it because it had other matters in hand. As a consequence, the ability of the House and the unanimous desire of its Members to establish committees of inquiry into matters of public concern has been seriously compromised due to either the wilful negligence of the Government or the incompetence of the people who surround the Taoiseach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters are related. Two weeks ago the committee forwarded a Bill to the Minister for Finance and to the Government Whip, who passed it to the Attorney General for his consideration. There are a number of issues which arise in respect of this matter. The first of these involves the matters due to come before the High Court on 29 May. I am advised that we must obtain a determination on these matters, including the privilege issue, to which Deputy Noonan referred. This was raised by the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport and it is a separate matter.</P>
      <P>The four issues on which the court must decide in relation to the Abbeylara inquiry are the fundamental challenge to the committee's right to conduct inquiries and the claim that politicians are not capable of being unbiased due to being directly elected by popular support; whether the terms of reference confine committees to policy matters or whether the Dáil can order specific inquiries &ndash; that is a root and branch challenge; whether consent is properly conveyed by e-mail or whether a formal letter is required &ndash; this involves the e-commerce Act and the efforts of the Abbeylara committee legal team to ensure the committee has proper legal authorisation before it proceeds &ndash; and the compellability committee is adamant, and has offered its legal view, that it was properly conveyed; and whether, constitutionally, committees should find facts by giving opinions or allocate blame. In addition, the lawyers for the ERU applied to the Secretary General to the Government seeking exemption and anonymity for certain gardaí giving evidence. The Secretary General to the Government is independent in this practice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan raised a separate point about the new privilege issues raised by the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport and the legislation being sought in respect of the CIE contract, which is being considered. I understand the Whips will meet to discuss matters. These are fundamental and extremely important issues and the House will benefit from the clarification the courts will provide in respect of some of them. Any information we obtain from the Attorney General will be passed, as soon as it comes into our possession, to the Whips by the Government Whip.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that two weeks ago, long before any action that could invoke the precedence of the Sinn Féin funds case &ndash; which determines law in this area &ndash; was taken in the High Court, the Chief Whip was presented with a Bill, which had both all-party support and the approval of the senior counsel to the two committees of inquiry currently established by <Col N="1102" /> the Oireachtas, and was informed in no uncertain terms of the urgent need to have it initiated and passed? I contend that the legislation in question would have been passed without any opposition. However, for some inexplicable reason &ndash; at best incompetence, at worst connivance intended to spancel the ability of this House to do its work &ndash; this matter was allowed to reach the stage at which it currently stands. When will the legislation be initiated in the House in order that we can put beyond any doubt the power of the Oireachtas, in the form of an all-party committee, to conduct inquiries into matters of public concern? The onus is on the Executive and with the majority in this House. The Government has failed in its responsibility to equip us with the legislative powers and means necessary to enable us to do the job for which we were elected.</P>

      <P>The Government Whip acted correctly in this instance. Deputy Quinn is correct in stating that he received the Bill and that he gave it to the Attorney General and the Minister for Finance. After that, however, matters are not so simple. These are major complex constitutional legal issues involved here. It was not a question of merely rushing a Bill through because the issues arose in respect of privilege, of advisers appearing before the committee, of how these people would be treated, etc. We could not deal quickly with these major complex legal issues. The Government, as the Chief Whip indicated at the time in question, supports the view of the committee. We must wait and see what will be the legal advice on these issues, which are also before the court for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 10 and 11.</P>
      <P>We had a long debate on Committee Stage on this radical Bill which seeks to delimit in a serious way the rights of Irish citizens and of their spouses to become Irish citizens in future and to give an exclusive right to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make determinations at his absolute discretion on matters that, until now, were matters of right. As I indicated throughout Committee Stage, I am implacably opposed to this shift because I do not see any justification for it and, as we did not hear any justification for it in all the hours of debate we have had on Committee Stage, I intend to oppose the measure again on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled amendment No. 1 to delete in the definition section the reference to the Act of 1956. The purpose of the amendment in so doing is to retain the existing scheme for handling these matters which was set out in the 1956 Act, that is, the right of spouses of citizens to become Irish citizens once a simple set of procedures is complied with. We will deal with the meat of these subjects in subsequent amendments. I begin as I intend to continue, by fighting this proposal line by line and as best I can. I begin by seeking to have the definition section amended so that exist<Col N="1107" /> ing provisions outlined in the 1956 Act which have served the country well and have given certainty to Irish citizens where their marriages and the rights of their spouses are concerned are retained for the future.</P>
    <P>This double blow at rights, one aimed at Irish citizens and relating to their right to ensure that their spouses or future spouses can have the precious gift of Irish citizenship given as of right, the other aimed at the future spouses of Irish citizens who will marry those citizens with a new cloud of uncertainty hanging over their future status, is wrong. I have not heard any clear, cogent or convincing reason from the Minister at any stage in the debate on either Second or Committee Stages to justify this draconian change in basic laws and rights. This first amendment is to ensure the <i>status quo</i> which has served the country reasonably well is maintained since there is not any clear or reasonable explanation for what the Minister proposes to do in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Howlin in this. On Committee Stage, he on behalf of the Labour Party and I on behalf of the Fine Gael Party made the same case regarding this area. As matters stand, an Irish citizen married to a non-national can, after a period, automatically confer citizenship on the non-national to whom he or she is married. There is no difficulty with it and no issue has given rise to a need to change legislation which will affect thousands of Irish citizens who marry non-nationals and which will affect the position of non-nationals in particular.</P>
      <P>The Minister has sought to replace a straightforward and workable provision which has been part of law since 1956 and which was modified in 1986 with an elaborate discretionary provision, which, as Deputy Howlin said, we will come to later in section 5, in which the Minister proposes that both he and all future Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have an absolute and wide discretion to determine whether a person's spouse should acquire Irish citizenship. A series of factors is listed in section 5 which even if all &ndash; even some of the more ludicrous &ndash; were complied with, the Minister may still refuse Irish citizenship to a citizen's husband or wife.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is proposing is objectionable. I have failed to hear the Minister give any reason worthy of support for this radical change in our legislative provision. I am concerned &ndash; and the Minister may clarify the up to date position &ndash; at the incapacity of the Department, as administered by the Minister, to make decisions on citizenship issues. As matters stand, if a husband marries a non-national his wife can automatically acquire Irish citizenship and <i>vice versa. </i>The Bill proposes that every application be given exhaustive examination and even investigations of the character of the person concerned will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this section was discussed on Committee Stage the Minister confirmed statistics which <Col N="1108" /> showed that several thousand people had been awaiting decisions on citizenship rights for between two and five years. These were people who sought Irish citizenship, not on the basis of marriage but of other criteria prescribed in the Act. Will the Minister tell us how many applicants for Irish citizenship are awaiting decisions on their applications from his Department, how many such applicants have been waiting for more than two years and how many have been waiting for more than four years? The Minister might then clarify how he proposes to implement in reasonable time the new complex provisions which form the centrepiece of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputies Howlin and Shatter. I am concerned that the rights of people who marry Irish citizens which are bestowed by the 1956 Act are being weakened by this legislation. The 1956 Act states that a non-national can become a citizen as of right if he or she is living with a spouse and the marriage is subsisting after at least three years. It is wrong that we are weakening this right which has stood for a considerable length of time and that we are doing so in legislation which is not designed to address this issue. We are using this legislation to reduce the rights of people who are married to Irish citizens. Many people are concerned about this. I hope the Minister will accept the arguments which are being made now and which were made on Committee Stage and abandon his intention to limit these rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statute law on nationality and citizenship in Ireland is out of kilter with the Constitution in a number of important respects. This has been the position since 2 December 1999 when the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution came into effect by the will of the people. The principal aim of this Bill is to remedy that.</P>
      <P>I have made every possible effort to deal with the inquiries and requests put before me on Committee Stage as expeditiously as possible and as consistently as possible with the need to debate fully the issues which arise. The amendments before us have already been dealt with in detail and I hope it is not necessary to discuss them in such detail again. However, if Members wish to do so that is their prerogative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems which must be addressed. There are clear abuses of the present process which must be remedied. I have also outlined the need for an amendment to previous legislation dealing with immigration and citizenship law. After the 1956 Act was enacted there was a great deal of concern. Until 1986 when the new law was enacted by way of amendment to the 1956 Act, there was reference only to women in the legislation. Male spouses were not referred to in the 1956 legislation, or at least they were not dealt with in a reasonable fashion. It was as if they did not exist. In the same way the three year moratorium has proved to be unworkable and techni<Col N="1109" /> cally flawed. We have come a long way since then. The purpose of this legislation is not to limit the right of Irish citizenship but to put Irish citizenship law on a modern footing.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal before the House to remove the reference to the Act of 1956 that appears in page 4, line 1 of the Bill. The reference I have mentioned is the core provision of the Bill, section 3, which replaces sections 6 and 7 of the 1956 Act with new provisions which give effect to our obligations on citizen matters under the Good Friday Agreement and bring statute law into line with the new Article 2 of the Constitution. There are many other references to the Act of 1956 throughout the Bill which remain unaffected by any of the amendments before the House.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the definition remain in section 1. I ask the Deputies to withdraw the amendment and I remind them that the discussion they have embarked on would be more appropriate when we consider section 3 &ndash; and the proposed amendments thereto &ndash; which replaces sections 6 and 7 of the Act of 1956. I see no point in engaging in an argument on this matter now.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;A person is an Irish citizen if adopted outside the State, whether or not such adoption is recognised pursuant to the Adoption Act, 1991, where the adopter or one of the adopters is at the date of the adoption an Irish citizen and where the adoption was effected in accordance with the laws of the State concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new subsection 4 into the Bill. In circumstances where an adoption order is made which is recognised in this State, the effect of that recognition, where the adopting couple are Irish citizens, is to confer Irish citizenship on the child. This provision is designed to deal with the situation which arises <Col N="1110" /> occasionally in which an Irish citizen adopts a child outside the State in circumstances where the adoption is not recognised in this State. A small number of doctors find themselves in this position. They find themselves in circumstances in which they cannot obtain a passport to travel for the child adopted by them. Their child, although brought up in this country by them, is not an Irish citizen and does not acquire Irish citizenship, although such a child may seek Irish citizenship when it attains adulthood on his or her own application, in his or her own right. A small number fall within this category in circumstances where they properly adopt according to the law of the foreign state and come back to live in this state. In circumstances in which the parents are Irish citizens, the proposal is that the child they adopt should automatically become an Irish citizen.</P>

      <P>The amendment in my name and that of Deputy O'Sullivan is an alternative to deal with an issue known in shorthand as the Cascarino issue. We debated it at some length on Committee Stage and I had hoped to see a Government amendment to deal with some aspects of it. Deputy Shatter outlined his proposal. I argued and debated the proposal I have resubmitted in amendment No. 7 dealing with Irish citizenship by descent for a person adopted outside the State before 1991.</P>
      <P>Up to 1952, Ireland had no adoption law and despite the tens of thousands involved in adoption, these informal arrangements had no legal status. Adoptees were left in a legal limbo. When the Adoption Bill was enacted in 1952 it did not formalise the recognition of foreign adoptions. It was not until 1991 that the Oireachtas passed legislation setting out rules for the recognition of such adoptions. As the Minister acknowledged, however, the Act was not retrospective. While it is difficult for those of us on this side of the House to frame legislative measures that might perfectly match the requirements of the situation, it is certainly within the ability of the Government to do so.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion, the Minister said that this issue was more appropriate to the Department of Health and Children and that his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, would bring forward amendments to the adoption laws to deal with the matter. I would like some clarification as to where stand the proposals of the Department of Health and Children on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of citizenship, the rightful purview of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, should we not clarify in this legislation the issue of the right of those foreign adoptions made prior to 1991 to be regularised? The issue should not be long-fingered for another Minister on another day and by another vehicle. Is it not right and proper for us to address it here and now? Has the Minister given any consideration to this or is it simply a matter of getting a note from an official that says, &ldquo;This is more proper to the Department of Health and Children, therefore I <Col N="1111" /> have no responsibility in the matter&rdquo;? The issue of citizenship is the Minister's responsibility. Even if it is not to be a permanent section, would it not be appropriate to insert a section that addresses the matter, one that can be superseded by a future enactment from a different Department if that day ever arrives?</P>
    <P>In his reply, I hope the Minister will not simply tell us this matter is not proper to the legislation. The intent of Deputy Shatter's amendment and the amendment in my name and that of Deputy O'Sullivan should be addressed by the Minister in some way. I am sorry there is no proposal by way of a Government amendment to address the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister has had considerable time between Committee and Report Stages in which to have discussions with the Minister for Health and Children or any other relevant Ministers. We should receive an answer from him today as to what is to be done about these potential citizens adopted before the 1991 Act under foreign adoption procedures. Whether it affects prominent football players, it affects a number of individuals who have rights in this matter. They have a right to have their situation clarified. If the Minister does not consider that it is a matter for his Department, he should at least tell us exactly how it will be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are opposed, as they were when discussed at some length on Committee Stage. To the extent that Deputy Shatter's proposed amendment deals with the citizenship situation of those whose adoptions are recognised under Irish law, the new section would be superfluous because it states what is already the statutory position. Adoptions undertaken abroad are recognised in Ireland pursuant to the provisions of the Adoption Act, 1991, as amended by the Adoption (Amendment) Act, 1998. The effect of the 1991 Act is that a foreign adoption which meets the criteria set out in the Act is regarded in Irish law as if it were an adoption order made under the Adoption Acts.</P>
      <P>As far as the citizenship of a person adopted by an Irish citizen is concerned, section 11 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, states that the adopted person is an Irish citizen from the date of the adoption. The question of naturalising a person who is already an Irish citizen, as envisaged in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the Deputy's proposal, simply does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, the promoter of the Bill for the 1991 Act, knows quite well that by setting out criteria for the recognition of foreign adoptions, the Act in effect defines also a class of foreign adoptions which are not recognised under Irish law. No doubt there were very good policy reasons the 1991 Act drew a distinction between the two classes of adoption. What the Deputy is in effect proposing is that we should ignore those policy reasons and bring forward a form of partial <Col N="1112" /> recognition for citizenship purposes. To the extent that the Deputy's amendment relates to adoptions not recognised under Irish law, that is, adoptions which do not meet the criteria set out in the 1991 Act, as amended, it is inappropriate and unacceptable. If an adoption does not come within these criteria, it does not make good law to extend Irish citizenship to such a person.</P>
    <P>I can readily appreciate that there are circumstances where Irish parents have undergone an adoption process in the country of origin of the child but that process has not resulted in an adoption which meets the criteria we have laid down in statute for recognition under Irish law &ndash; most frequently, I understand, because adoption in the countries in question maintains links of guardianship and certain residual rights in the natural parents. Irish adoption law is predicated on there being a complete severing of the legal links between the child and the natural parents and the forging of new legal links of an equal nature between the child and its adoptive parents. The 1991 legislation, as amended, takes this as the cornerstone of the recognition of foreign adoptions and in so doing has broadened considerably on the rather restrictive view, based among other matters on the test of domicile, taken by the courts up to that point.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the real problems faced by adoptive parents in these special circumstances and their concerns for the rights of their adopted children. However, I must be conscious of the fact that in law the natural parents of such children continue to have an entitlement to be heard and have a say in the future of their children. The issue that needs to be addressed in relation to these children is not the piecemeal question of citizenship in isolation but the whole package of rights and relationships which Irish law should or should not recognise as existing between such adoptive children and their natural parents, the children and their adoptive parents, and between the natural and adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is undertaking a review of the law on the recognition of foreign adoptions with such considerations in mind. The review is in the context of the preparation of the legislation necessary to ratify the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption. That, I strongly urge, is the proper context in which to address the issue, not just of the citizenship of the children concerned but also of all the other rights which are in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the citizenship legislation of certain countries throughout the world abhors the notion of dual citizenship, to the extent that the acquisition of citizenship of another country may act to deprive a person of his or her citizenship of origin. The Deputy's amendment would mean that our law would impose Irish citizenship on a child who, by virtue <Col N="1113" /> of the nature of the particular adoption, maintains legal links with his or her natural parents and citizenship of the country of origin. Such a law might conflict with the rights under our Constitution of the child and its natural parents, primarily by changing the citizenship of the child without reference to the natural parents' guardianship rights and, possibly also, depending on the approach to dual citizenship of the country of origin, by depriving the child of its citizenship of origin without regard to the wishes of its natural parents.</P>
      <P>I turn to the amendment in the names of Deputies Howlin and O'Sullivan. Their intention is to address the question of Irish citizenship by descent to the person adopted outside the State before 1991. The effect of the Adoption Act, 1991, in tandem with the citizenship Act, is that once the adoption comes within the criteria of the 1991 Act, as amended in 1998, and at least one of the adopters is himself or herself an Irish citizen, the adopted child becomes an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>Citizenship by descent through an adoptive link operates in an analogous fashion to citizenship through natural links. If a non-national child is adopted by an Irish adoptive parent, he or she is an Irish citizen from the date of the adoption and this applies whether the adoption is conducted under Irish law or as a foreign adoption which meets the criteria of the Adoption Act, 1991. If a person so adopted goes on to have a child of his or her own abroad, the child is, in turn, an Irish citizen because the parent was an Irish citizen at the time of the child's birth.</P>
      <P>I recognise there is a class of persons whose citizenship dates not from the date of the adoption, but from the date of the commencement of the Adoption Act, 1991, 30 May 1991. They are persons adopted by an Irish parent by means of a foreign adoption order before that date with the exclusion of those cases where the Irish parent was domiciled in the jurisdiction where the adoption was made. For a person in that class who gave birth outside Ireland before that date the child is not an Irish citizen and does not acquire citizenship by reason of the parent's later acquisition of Irish citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a reasonable and consistent way for the law to operate, though it is always open to a person born in these circumstances to apply for naturalisation and the Deputies' amendment envisages this possibility. However, the thrust of the amendment is to give a certificate of naturalisation granted in these circumstances retrospective effect to the birth of the child. As I stated on Committee Stage, this would be unacceptable in principle and could have unexpected side effects, giving rise to uncertainty. I presented Deputies with certain scenarios to illustrate my concerns and while they treated them with some amusement on that occasion, this perhaps reflects their lack of appreciation of the matter but does not <Col N="1114" /> undermine the validity and seriousness of my concerns.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, the Deputies' amendment confines itself to circumstances where the adopters are ordinarily resident in the State on the date of the adoption. The scope of the recognition afforded by the Adoption Act, 1991, as amended, goes well beyond that limited circumstance. It covers adoptions effective in the place of domicile of the adopters, in the place where they were habitually resident, in the place where they were ordinarily resident and in a place other than where they had domicile or residence.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Act also encompasses certain adoptions made before and after its commencement. I reiterate my assertion that the proper context in which to modify the law on adoption, including the law as it affects the citizenship of adopted persons, is in the context of the amendments of the Adoption Acts, on which my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is working. If there are sound policy reasons for changing the criteria on the recognition of foreign adoptions &ndash; I hold no view one way or the other on the issue &ndash; my Government colleague will take them into account in devising his legislative proposals.</P>
      <P>With regard to the measures agreed by the Cabinet, about which Deputy Howlin asked, the adoption laws concerned relate to information, not the broader issue of adoption <i>per se</i>. In addition, the legislation discussed did not relate to the Hague Convention on foreign adoptions, which is a different matter. The legislation referred to on the Order of Business, as the Taoiseach said, relates to the question of information.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response was profoundly depressing but symptomatic of the capacity of the Government to address issues relating to adoption. The Government will celebrate four years in office in approximately four weeks and has utterly failed to bring before the House any reforming measure required in the area of adoption. This legislation is an example of that failure. The only legislation enacted by it was the Adoption (Amendment) Act, 1998, which was drafted by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The amendments were discussed on Wednesday, 1 November 2000 by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>We must also consider the rights and relationships between the children and their adoptive parents and between the natural and adoptive parents. There is, therefore, a whole package of rights and relationships, none of which can be considered in isolation, because it would be wrong to do so. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is undertaking a review of the law on the recognition of foreign adoptions with such considerations in mind. The review is in the context of the preparation of legislation necessary to ratify the Hague convention on inter-country adoption.</P>
      <P>He has managed some seven months later to confirm to the House that not only is nothing happening in Government, but he is still using the same text. The speech could not even be rewritten and updated. The Law Reform Commission produced a report in 1996 dealing with the Hague Convention on the recognition of foreign adoptions and the legislation required to implement it.</P>
      <P>The Bill was referred to a select committee following Second Stage and the members of the committee took their job seriously as they spent three days teasing out amendments, yet the Minister has blissfully-&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the conduct of business in the House and the attitude towards it of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in particular. I fear that Department, above all others, is guilty of taking the House for granted in the way legislation is dealt with all the <Col N="1116" /> time. Significant amendments to a series of Bills have been thrown at us at the last minute. It is symptomatic of the way in which we are dealt with that a recycled speech from seven months ago is used again to reply to the same points. We hoped the Minister would have given some genuine consideration to these serious points.</P>
      <P>I listed the Cascarino case, in which a set of circumstances exists. In the circumstances he could not claim Irish citizenship by descent as his mother had been adopted by Irish citizens outside the State and there were no rules in force at the time for the recognition of that adoption. Since 1991 we have had rules but they cannot be retrospectively applied to entitle the claimant to citizenship dating from the date of his or her birth.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and I suggested an amendment to enable a person who cannot claim citizenship by descent only because foreign adoption was not recognised to become a citizen through naturalisation. It is appropriate to this legislation and affects a particular category. There was no serious effort to address the issue by the Minister in his long, rambling, recycled reply. Such a reaction from the Minister and the Government is not good enough. If the work of Opposition Deputies in trying to come to terms with their responsibilities in this serious matter, which the Minister has lauded, certainly in private, is recognised as worthy of response, it is worthy of serious and considered response after a period of time. It is appalling that the Minister treats us in this cavalier way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Howlin, said, this matter is relevant to the Bill and he outlined very specific circumstances in a particular case. The patterns of emigration of Irish people over decades, in particular the 1950s and 1960s when large numbers emigrated, are such that there is likely to be a number of such people in limbo. I put it to the Minister that the adoption legislation in relation to ratification of the Hague Convention is now likely to be put on the long finger in view of the fact that priority is being given to the contact register, the heads of which Bill were agreed today by Cabinet. The pattern by which these matters are dealt with is such that that legislation is likely to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas before the other legislation is even dealt with. I am aware from contacts I have had that there are a number of contentious issues which need to be dealt with under the Hague Convention, particularly in relation to countries in which Irish couples are adopting which do not seem to be interested in ratifying the convention. A number of major issues will have to be dealt with under that legislation and it is unlikely that the Department of Health and Children will deal with it in the lifetime of the Government. The Minister has an opportunity to deal with what is, in a sense, a narrow issue dealing with a specific category of person under this legislation but he is refusing to do so. He is hand<Col N="1117" /> ing it over to a different Department. I support Deputy Howlin in relation to this matter. The legislation to which the Minister referred on ratification of the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption is unlikely to be dealt with by the Government and he has the opportunity to deal with this specific issue under this legislation.</P>

      <P>The position is as I outlined it. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is still dealing with the review seven months later. This is a most complex area and the fact that the information question is being dealt with does not mean that the wider issue is being ignored. That is patently not the case and my understanding is that work on the review is continuing apace. If what I said today replicates what I said seven months ago, it is because the review is ongoing but I understand the review has made considerable progress since I made the initial statement seven months ago.</P>

      <Col N="1118" /> I have outlined my position as best I can in the short time available to me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Having pointed out that the Minister is saying exactly what he said seven months ago, the review about which he is talking, which allegedly has made such wonderful progress, is the same review Deputy Cowen was conducting for two years before he was relieved from his post in the Department of Health and Children. As normally happens when someone proves to be incompetent, he was promoted to the Foreign Affairs brief. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has, therefore, been reviewing Deputy Cowen's review. Effectively, a committee which dealt with this issue seven months ago has been ignored entirely by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendment I proposed was designed, as Deputy Howlin put it, to cover the Cascarino anomaly, as we euphemistically referred to it because our debate on the Bill coincided with the publication of Mr. Cascarino's book on his experiences as an Irish international. The amendment has a serious intent, however, in that it seeks to rectify the citizenship of a number of individuals. It seeks to deal with the anomaly I pointed out where an Irish couple of Irish citizenship adopt, according to the law of a foreign country, a child whose adoption is not recognised in this State and seeks to ensure the child they adopt automatically acquires Irish citizenship. What happens currently is that if the child has lived in Ireland up to the age of 18 years, he or she will normally apply for citizenship and the Minister of the day will normally grant it. There is no complexity about the matter. There is no reason for withholding citizenship and the issue is not as complex as the Minister pretends.</P>
      <P>It was my hope, as I believe it was Deputy Howlin's, that having heard the debate on the issue on Committee Stage we would have before us a Government sponsored amendment to ensure it was properly addressed. I am disappointed it was not dealt with by Government amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Adoption Act, 1991. I am proud of the fact that I steered that Private Members' Bill through the House. Over 1,000 foreign adoptions that would not otherwise have been recognised have been recognised and the children of those adoptions have acquired Irish citizenship but the political reality is that the Bill did not address every issue I would have liked it to address because certain compromises had to be made to ensure the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government did not vote it down. The Bill did not cross every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and dot every &ldquo;i&rdquo;. This is one of the areas that remains to be addressed. It has not been addressed and I am disappointed that the Minister is now opposing what is a simple and straightforward amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete line 22.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete section 4(1) which states that section 8 of the Act of 1956 is hereby repealed. The import of the amendment, therefore, would be to forestall the deletion of section 8 of the Act of 1956 which was inserted by section 3 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, and provides that an alien &ndash; that lovely word was in use at that stage &ndash; who marries an Irish national can become a citizen as of right. If he or she is living with a spouse and the marriage is still subsisting after at least three years, a declaration and an affidavit must be lodged. The alien spouse becomes a citizen as and from the lodging of the declaration, a simple, straightforward, humane procedure. This process is distinct from naturalisation. Consequently, once a person becomes a citizen by marriage and post-marriage declaration, this right cannot be subsequently taken from him or her.</P>
      <P>This section repeals the vested right of the spouse of an Irish citizen to become a citizen. This is a critical matter for the Labour Party. The Bill and the Minister propose to remove an existing right, established in the 1986 Act, by way of amendment to the 1956 Act, and replace it with the Minister's absolute discretion which can only be exercised if certain restrictive criteria, discussed at length on Committee Stage, are established. We will deal with the criteria in subsequent amendments but issues such as good character and so on must be complied with. However, complying with this long list of criteria is not good enough as the matter then falls to the absolute discretion of the Minister. These listed criteria are not to be found in existing law. The grant of citizenship is to be by way of naturalisation and, therefore, can be revoked by the Minister. As I stated on Committee Stage, this proposal is an attack, not only on the rights of non-nationals, but also on the rights of Irish citizens who choose of volition to marry non-nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister presented this matter in his usual way as a measure to combat what he categorised as bogus marriages. This is a clear example of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Fundamental rights of Irish citizens and spouses of Irish citizens are being dismantled by a Minister under the guise of attacking some illegality. On Committee Stage we pressed the Minister for concrete data rather than anecdotes about taxi drivers coming from the North &ndash; dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean eile &ndash; that there was a thriving market in bogus marriages and that people were coming down to abuse naturalisation and citizenship legislation. We have heard no good reasons for this substantive attack on the rights of Irish citizens to choose to marry whoever they wish and on the surety that the spouses of Irish citizens will, as of right, once the criteria laid down by the 1986 amendment to the 1956 Act are <Col N="1120" /> complied with, also obtain Irish citizenship. No compelling reason for these changes was ever given. This proposal is false, based on a false premise and a traditional draconian measure coming from people who have a blinkered view of a changing Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and reverse engines regarding this matter. He should do so or, once and for all, give us a compelling reason to justify this assault on the rights of citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is important to the Labour Party. The Bill proposes a fundamental change in human rights for a category of persons, namely, non-national spouses of Irish citizens and Irish citizens who have chosen, and who have the right to choose, whoever they wish to marry. If an Irish citizen chooses to marry a non-national, and the marriage has lasted for three years and they are living together for three years as husband and wife, the non-national has, under current legislation, the right to become an Irish citizen without seeking the permission of the Minister or fulfilling any criteria regarding age or being of good character. This right exists under the 1956 Act, as amended by the 1986 Act. The Bill is not designed to deal with this issue but is being used to water down the rights of citizens. The Minister is seeking to withdraw this right from Irish citizens who choose to marry non-nationals and from non-nationals who marry Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The Minister has used anecdotes and references to certain practices not backed up by any kind of official figures to remove this right which exists under legislation. The Labour Party fundamentally disagrees with its removal. The Minister has not produced any evidence which suggests that we should change our minds in this regard. It is not right to remove such a provision without offering substantial reasons for doing so. The Minister has not produced any such reasons.</P>
      <P>The amendment is central in terms of our view of how rights should be drafted in this jurisdiction and that the change proposed by the Bill should not be introduced. This change will reduce rights which currently exist. The change also fundamentally questions a couple's decision to get married and the institution of marriage into which they have decided to enter. The Bill questions their intentions in this regard. This is a serious matter to insert in legislation on the basis of anecdotal evidence that people may be abusing the system.</P>
      <P>Current legislation stipulates a three year period which is a safeguard against the Minister's suggestion that there may be bogus marriages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Howlin's comments. This is an important amendment and, <Col N="1121" /> even at this late stage, I hope the Minister will listen to the Opposition's reasoned arguments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which proposes to delete the Minister's proposal and preserve the current provisions in the 1986 Act. The Minister has failed to give any reasonable explanation as to the reason a law which has been in force for 14 or 15 years requires change. In the absence of substantial reasons, it is my view, and that of Fine Gael, that this law should not change. Under the 1986 Act, if an Irish citizen marries a non-Irish citizen, and if they have been living together for three years, the non-Irish citizen can automatically acquire Irish citizenship by lodging a declaration. There is no reason to change the law in this regard.</P>
      <P>At the start of the debate I asked the Minister how his Department would administer the change he is proposing. Instead of the lodging of a simple declaration and, thereby, the obtaining of citizenship, this change will require an elaborate investigation of each applicant by the Department. From statistics supplied by the Minister on Committee Stage, we are aware that, as at 17 October 2000, there were 1,882 applicants for Irish citizenship in the context of naturalisation waiting to be dealt with. At that time there were 700 postnuptial declarations by husbands or wives married to Irish citizens in which they acquired Irish citizenship. However, the declarations required the issuing of certificates of citizenship by the Department. This is an administrative exercise carried out under the 1986 Act. However, the Department had a backlog of 700 applications with which it had to deal, when all it had to do was to rubber-stamp documentation it received.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael and the Labour Party are opposed to the change the Minister is proposing. At the beginning of Report Stage I asked him to provide an update on these statistics. His doing so will indicate, if we introduce the change he is proposing and which Fine Gael and the Labour Party oppose, the capacity of his Department to administer a new system. The system the Minister proposes will require that a couple not only reside together for three years but that a series of other criteria be dealt with. Instead of allowing a non-citizen spouse acquire Irish citizenship shortly after three years from the date of marriage, it will take five to six years.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House how many applications for citizenship are outstanding in his Department, how many are awaiting decision for two years and how many are awaiting decision for more than two years? Will he also indicate what changes are being introduced in the Department to implement this system should this legislation be passed in its current form? In the absence of convincing arguments from him, Fine Gael will oppose the Minister's proposal and support the Labour Party in the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed. It seeks to remove the substance of section 4, <Col N="1122" /> subsection (1) of which repeals section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as inserted by section 3 of the 1986 Act, which provides for declarations of citizenship by non-national spouses of Irish citizens &ndash; post-nuptial citizenship.</P>
      <P>At subsection (2), provision is made for a transitional period of three years for those who married Irish citizens before the commencement of the section, but for whom the three year minimum period of marriage before which a declaration cannot be made had not yet expired. The post-nuptial citizenship provisions are being replaced by a new scheme of naturalisation for spouses of Irish citizens, provided for at section 5.</P>
      <P>Under section 8 of the 1956 Act, the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen, other than a naturalised Irish citizen, may make a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship after three years from the date of the marriage or, where later, the date on which his or her spouse became an Irish citizen. There are conditions to be met: the marriage must be subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration and the couple must be living together as husband and wife. The Irish spouse must provide an affidavit to that effect at the time the declaration is lodged.</P>
      <P>This provision, inserted in the 1956 Act by the amending Act of 1986, replaced the original provision under which only the wife of an Irish citizen could make such a declaration. She became a citizen from the date of her marriage. The declaration is of acceptance of Irish citizenship. Unlike the provisions relating to naturalisation, there is no requirement of residence, good character or a declaration of fidelity and loyalty to the State. Subject to the person satisfying the necessary conditions, he or she becomes a citizen from the date of lodgement of his or her declaration. A declaration may be lodged directly to the Minister or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office.</P>
      <P>It has been the experience of both my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs that a variety of fraudulent schemes have been organised to exploit loopholes in this provision with the intention of securing an Irish passport. On Committee Stage I went into considerable detail to outline the nature of these concerns. I adverted to the growing number of cases in hand in my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs where abuse of the post-nuptial declaration system is suspected&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and where the declarant and spouse have been asked for further information but no response is forthcoming. Cases are left hanging because, in all probability, the declarant is aware that he or she has been caught out. I gave examples of Irish spouses of non-nationals who have made the required statutory declaration but written to both Departments pleading <Col N="1123" /> that the non-national's citizenship not be recognised because of violence or bullying. I gave examples of serial spouses, where an Irish person has through a succession of marriages and divorces been instrumental in the obtaining of post-nuptial declarations for several spouses&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>How many cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and each declaration is of unimpeachable validity. I also referred to grave concerns about the undesirable character of some of those who, by marrying Irish citizens and making the declaration after three years, perforce became Irish citizens. Among them were people with terrorist, sex crime and drug offence records.</P>
      <P>An Irish passport is a most valued possession. It gives open access to the territory of the European Union and its employment markets. The fact that declarations can be made by spouses who have never set foot in Ireland and who may never do so makes the process of validating such declarations within my Department or the Department of Foreign Affairs extremely difficult. This is hardly a satisfactory basis for the acquisition of Irish citizenship, particularly when these real abuses are taking place.</P>
      <P>The termination of the scheme of post-nuptial citizenship means, effectively, that non-national spouses of Irish citizens habitually resident outside the island of Ireland will, after the transitional three year period provided for in subsection (2) of this section, no longer be in a position to obtain citizenship based on their marriage alone. However, new section 15A in the 1956 Act, being inserted by section 5 of the Bill, which provides for a special scheme for the naturalisation of spouses of Irish nationals, contains at subsection (2) a provision whereby the Minister may waive certain of the conditions for naturalisation of spouses. The conditions which can be waived include the residence requirements on the island of Ireland at subsection (1)(f2&gt;f) and (f2&gt;g) of that section, where the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>I made clear on Committee Stage that this new provision does not supplant the existing arrangements set out in section 15 of the Act of 1956, as inserted by the Act of 1986. Those arrangements still stand. The Bill sets up in parallel a variation of those arrangements, available to the spouses of Irish citizens who are married for at least three years and still living with their Irish partners, which offers a discount on the normal residence requirements but which is otherwise subject to largely the same conditions as the existing scheme. If a person, for whatever reason, does not qualify for the discount, there remains the option to have the application for naturalisation considered under the existing scheme, including the scope for waiving some of the conditions for naturalisation built into the existing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> In short, the fact that the discounted period of residence under the new scheme does not apply to an applicant for naturalisation should not be taken to mean that the applicant is not eligible for naturalisation. It only means that the conditions of the existing scheme at section 15 of the Act apply, together with any waivers that may be appropriate under section 16 of the Act.</P>
    <P>I consider sections 4 and 5 of the Bill, taken together, to be a reasonable and well balanced approach which takes into account the position in the European Union and other states. The balance achieved is between the desirability of having a means for non-national spouses to become Irish citizens on the one hand and the protection of the interests of Irish society by reducing the scope for abuses of our citizenship on the other. The conditions attaching to this special scheme of naturalisation are not in any sense unreasonable and would be regarded in many states as basic requirements for the granting of citizenship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter asked about the number of applications for naturalisation. Last year, 1,004 applications for naturalisation were received, an increase of 36% on the 1999 figure of 739 and an increase of 190% on the 1996 figure of 347. The number of applicants for post-nuptial citizenship has remained constant in the past two years at about 420 each year. However, this represents an increase of 64% on the figure for 1996, which was 256. My Department is also responsible for finalising approximately 600 applications for post-nuptial citizenship from persons resident outside the State.</P>
    <P>I accept there are and were unacceptable delays. Sometimes these delays can be due to incorrectly or incompletely filled forms. Over 80% of applications fall into this category. This generates vast amounts of correspondence which requires resources that might otherwise be involved in finalising correct applications.</P>
    <P>We have allocated additional resources and staff to the immigration and citizenship division of the Department as part of the overall resource package underpinning the Government's immigration and asylum strategy. While it is true that most of the staff have been allocated to the asylum issue, it is the intention to try to reduce the waiting lists for naturalisation. Most of the staff are now in place and when the remainder come on stream the staff engaged full time in the processing of citizenship applications will have doubled. Notwithstanding the recent arrival of many of the staff in question and the need for training and so forth, we have succeeded in reducing the processing time for naturalisation applications by approximately six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As new staff come on stream and existing staff become more familiar with the legislative provisions and operational procedures, it is intended that further reductions in processing times will be achieved. The processing time was <Col N="1125" /> in the region of two years and six months. That has reduced to two years in a very short period and I expect it to reduce even more dramatically as staff are trained and become more familiar with this area. Applications will be expedited and people will receive results at an earlier date.</P>

It does not take a genius to understand that if the only requirement for citizenship is to produce a declaration to the effect that one has been married to an Irish person for three years, it is open to abuse.

      <P>Abuses of the system are not figments of my imagination; I have outlined real examples in this regard. Irish citizenship should not be cheapened by abuses of this nature and such abuses should not be tolerated. There is no good reason I, as an individual politician, would seek to put barriers in the way of genuine spouses of Irish citizens gaining citizenship. To do so would be an act of lunacy. I am trying to close off the potential for abuse which has been recognised by the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs over a number of years. I am not trying to put obstacles in anyone's way. The termination of the post-nuptial citizenship scheme will not adversely affect the position of non-national spouses in terms of their joining their spouses in the State, nor will it adversely affect their right to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dismayed once again by the Minister's response. He has not outlined any cogent evidence whatsoever in regard to bogus applications. We want numbers. What percentage of the total number of applications under the scheme does the Minister suspect to be bogus? Suspicions abound in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, although I do not believe they will all be proven, it should provide some indication of the level of abuse detected by the Inspector Clouseau-like Minister who wants to stand a 1986 decision of the Oireachtas on its head. Those who introduced the scheme in 1986 were not lunatics although the Minister may, perhaps, think it was daft to allow the spouses of Irish citizens to automatically apply for and be <Col N="1126" /> granted citizenship as of right after three years of marriage. Is that considered an act of lunacy under the new conservatism, epitomised by the Minister, which prevails in the Department? </P>
      <P>The Bill is a welcome requirement under the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement but the Minister has once again abused this vehicle, as he has done time and again in regard to asylum and immigration matters, by the insertion of draconian measures in the Bill. This provision on citizenship rights is wrong; the Minister failed to provide any rationale for it or convince anyone of its necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister failed to outline any figures in regard to the number abusing the current system although he provided some colourful examples on Committee Stage. Has he given any consideration to the fact that in closing an alleged loophole which he considers is being abused by a small number &ndash; although he cannot quantify the number involved &ndash; he is affecting hundreds of others who have a perfect entitlement to citizenship, following three years of marriage to an Irish national? The Minister is removing a right and introducing a discretionary power which will provide people with naturalisation, which can be taken away, rather than citizenship, thereby diluting the right to citizenship in a second way. Furthermore, he is creating additional bureaucracy for a Department which is already weighed down by red tape and obligations which are not being complied with in any kind of reasonable timeframe. What was heretofore a right on the lodgement of certain papers will now become a ministerial discretion, requiring the Department, already overloaded with work, to engage in a great deal of investigation. This provision is not only completely illogical; it is fundamentally wrong in terms of people's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with interest that the Minister deliberately avoided answering a particular question I raised. He outlined statistics in regard to naturalisation, informing the House that there were 1,004 additional applicants in this area during 2000. I asked him to outline the number of applications on which decisions were pending. As of October, 1,882 applicants awaited decisions on naturalisation applications. The current grossly excessive waiting time is two years. I suggest that the 1,882 figure now stands at 2,500. This is a clear indication that the Department will not be in a position to cope with the new procedure the Minister proposes to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined anecdotal evidence as to the reason this law should be changed. I want to remind him of information he made available to me which highlights the lunacy of the current proposal. Some 3,850 post-nuptial citizenship declarations were made in the period 1997 to October 2000 by non-nationals. During that period, 23 spousal declarations were denied or refused. Of these, ten related to 1997, leaving a figure of 13 for the period 1998 to October 2000. We cannot <Col N="1127" /> know whether these applications were refused due to incomplete or inaccurate forms or some other reason. The Minister is suggesting that we change our citizenship laws, denying non-nationals who marry Irish citizens automatic citizenship of the State. This will require the Department to process an additional 1,000 applications per annum in circumstances in which naturalisation applications cannot be processed within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>This is a bizarre proposal. The Minister is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and anecdotal evidence to back up his argument. I challenge him to inform the House whether there are now more on the waiting list for naturalisation than there were when he addressed us on Committee Stage and how he proposes to have these applications processed in a reasonable time. A two year waiting period is far from reasonable.</P>

      <P>Any individual who is resident in the State for three years, of good character and complies with the declaration is clearly entitled to citizenship. I do not understand the difficulty. These rules and regulations are in existence in other EU states and would be regarded as the minimum required. Irish citizenship and Irish passports are valuable commodities and cannot be consigned to some other status. In a significant number of cases, a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship is lodged but not pursued by the applicant when he or she is asked for further details to clarify a matter. This clearly indicates that there is a significant number of cases where there is probable abuse. I gave specific examples of where abuse occurred in the past.

      <P>There is very little chance of it. The Minister's response, argument and logic were entirely disingenuous. The figures mentioned by Deputy Shatter blow apart any justification on the Minister's part for claiming the system is abused. The figures were provided in a response to a parliamentary question and show that a total of 23 declarations were refused in four years out of an average of 1,200 applications processed each year. It is a tiny fraction of the overall applications received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What basis is there for stating that the scheme is being abused and needs to be abolished? There was a total of 23 refusals in four years from the thousands of applications processed in that period by the Department. On that basis, there <Col N="1129" /> would be no schemes left in the country. For example, there would be no social welfare schemes if they were abolished on the basis of 23 suggested fraudulent cases. They were the only cases refused and there could be valid reasons that they were refused. One cannot declare that the cases were all bogus.</P>
    <P>If the logic of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was applied, no welfare support schemes would be operated by the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Health and Children. The Minister will erode the rights of thousands of Irish citizens and the potential rights of future Irish citizens because of a per<Col N="1130" /> ception of abuse for which he cannot give any statistical proof or convincing argument. This disgraceful suggestion is typical of his attitude on these matters. It brings shame on us that he has reacted in this fashion and characterised those who want to avail of their unalienable rights, given freely by the Oireachtas in 1986. He wants to abolish the scheme and create a system where he alone has absolute discretionary rights on who should be granted Irish citizenship in the future on the basis of marriage. It is shameful and wrong. I am exasperated by the lack of response or coherent argument from the Minister and wish to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes, that during the four wasted years of the term of office of this Government,</P>
      <P>(a) many public health services have actually deteriorated causing pain and suffering to those in need of treatment, care and support;</P>
      <P>(b) despite the urgency of the crisis now facing the health service, at the much hyped special Cabinet meeting held at Ballymascanlon on 14 May, no decisions were made nor any initiatives agreed to improve the situation;</P>
      <P>(c) the clear divisions between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance which are a further obstacle to health care reform;</P>
      <P>and deplores, in particular:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to create a customer-focused health care service as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium, or to produce any comprehensive programme of health reform;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to deliver on the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millennium to tackle the crisis in hospital waiting lists, as almost 28,000 public patients are waiting for treatment and waiting times in certain specialties have increased;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to substantially improve mental health and autistic services as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium, especially in view of the restrictive nature of the Mental Health Bill and the deplorable delay in progressing it through the Oireachtas;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to increase income levels for eligibility for medical cards for large families, as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium, as a result of which many people in need are deprived of access to the level of health care they require; </P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to tackle the grave inequity caused by the two tier nature of our hospital system;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to provide the additional beds in acute and non-acute hospitals needed to provide for our growing population;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to introduce repeatedly promised legislation to further control tobacco advertising, despite the continuing toll that smoking takes on health and the additional financial burden placed on the health service;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to honour commitments made in February last to ensure speedy repayment of moneys improperly demanded from adult children of those in nursing homes;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to end the practice of keeping patients with intellectual disabilities in psychiatric hospitals;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to ensure adequate community <Col N="1133" /> care services to support families caring for dependants in the home;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to deal with the serious shortage of nursing staff or to address the concern of nurses in regard to working conditions;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to fill all the 29 consultant AE and anaesthetist posts announced last October under the winter beds initiative;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to fully progress the commitments made on working times and conditions for non-consultant junior hospital doctors;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to deliver a full national breast cancer screening service and cervical cancer screening service;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to deal with the serious crisis in the orthodontic service, especially in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area where more than 12,000 people are awaiting treatment or assessment;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to adequately fund the child welfare and protection services resulting in growing waiting lists for social work services and inadequate residential care services for many children at risk;</P>
    <P>and instructs the Minister for Health and Children to report back to the Dáil not later than the last day prior to the summer recess, on what progress he has made on all of these issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Stagg, Penrose, Rabbitte and Upton.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is tabling this motion because it recognises health as the most urgent political and social issue facing the public. It is obvious that the Government is neither aware of the depth of the crisis, nor is it capable of producing a coherent response to tackle it. The much-hyped Cabinet meeting at Ballymascanlon was supposed to deliver on health care and silence the critics of the Government's failure to address the crisis, or so the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, wanted us to believe. Instead it resulted in a ministerial mauling, a Cabinet in confusion and a victory for the hard right. The slapping down of the Minister for Health and Children by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, left no doubt as to the true nature of the Government. In the face of an ideology that rewards the rich and denies the poor in successive budgets and discriminates in health care on an ongoing basis, the Minister for Health and Children is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of the Mercedes of the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Health and Children wants to spend <Col N="1134" /> more money on health while the Minister for Finance wants to stop spending more money on health. Both have spelt out their positions and both are wrong.</P>
    <P>We need more money for additional beds and staffing and value for money. However, unless the health service is based on proper funding allied with a new dispensation of universal care and a new relationship between patient and care provider, the opportunity to deliver a world class service to all our citizens will be lost. We have the economic capacity to provide such a health service. The Labour Party has set out the framework for a 21st century health service based on a universal insurance scheme that would encompass everyone, regardless of means, and ensure those of us who can afford to contribute towards it would do so. Such a system would provide the safeguard of a free general practitioner care service while maintaining the current drug schemes. It would integrate primary care with secondary care in order that only those who need to be in hospital would go to hospital and it would encourage effective health promotion. It would abolish the two tier system in our hospital sector whereby hospital consultants are paid differently for their public patients and their private patients leading to gross inequities and waiting lists. Under our proposals the patient would be central to the service because the money would follow the patient.</P>
    <P>We have set out the framework which would deliver care on the basis of need, guarantee excellence of care and encourage value for money. After four years in office the Government has still to declare how it intends to tackle the issues. They have been four wasted years. Why should sick Irish people expect anything less than the best? Other European peoples expect quality care when they need it and that is what they get. The French health system is the best in the world; yet, the French economy is not growing as fast as ours, nor are they wealthier than us anymore. The most disturbing aspect of the meeting at Ballymascanlon is that it is clear the Government has no intention of reforming the health service, it never intended to and is not going to. It has run out of time and what is needed is not just a new start in health care but a new Government to deliver on it. The record speaks for itself. During the four wasted years of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats term of office there has been unprecedented prosperity and a real opportunity to create a quality health service for all our people. Instead of taking that opportunity the Government has presided over a deepening crisis.</P>
    <P>The opportunity was squandered first by a Minister who did not know or care about health reform. Never was a Minister more glad to be rid of a Department than Deputy Cowen. When he left his legacy was two years of industrial relations chaos, ward closures, shattered morale among hospital professionals and lengthening queues. Now Deputy Micheál Martin is in the job, though not in the driving seat. Thatcherism has put him <Col N="1135" /> in his place and now, as if things were not bad enough, we have the Minister for Finance imposing his ideas on health care. The McCreevy solution is not to increase bed numbers but simply to remove private beds out of public hospitals. Like many of his views, it is simplistic and superficially attractive. It is also wrong. It ignores the fact that the vast number of admissions nowadays are through accident and emergency departments while 50% of people take out health insurance. The increased cost of his approach would force more people out of private health insurance and on to the public waiting lists which, in turn, would put additional pressure on public beds. The cycle would become more vicious.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals from the Minister for Finance, our health service would become worse and more unfairly divided between those who can afford to buy quality care and those who are denied it. The Minister is proposing the US model of health care and the Taoiseach appears to be happy to row in behind his right-wing ideologue in the Department of Finance. He wants to know what crisis we are talking about. The Taoiseach is adamant there is no crisis in the health service. At Ballymascanlon there was subliminal jostling for position in the next leadership contest within Fianna Fáil, but the sick and dying are the losers. They are the victims of a Government which has grown complacent and is protected from the harsh realities affecting the sick. The desperate state of our health service impacts directly on the most vulnerable &ndash; the elderly, the poor, the ailing and those who cannot afford to buy any American style health care the Minister for Finance might like to offer.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, despite his good intentions, the Minister for Health and Children is powerless to make the necessary changes. He has not succeeded in reaching his own modest targets. Last October he announced with great fanfare his winter beds initiative and the appointment of 29 new consultant posts. Eight months later, as we approach midsummer, 450 hospital beds are still inappropriately occupied and all the consultant posts have not been filled. Hospital wards are still closed and nursing staff are in short supply. Almost 30,000 people are on waiting lists for procedures and thousands more are waiting to see a specialist. The hospital building programme is bogged down. The sick and elderly in our major hospitals are forced to suffer the indignity of lying on trolleys for hours and days while they wait for a bed.</P>
    <P>The four wasted years have left a terrible legacy of pain and suffering in their wake. I am talking about suffering such as that experienced by a man who contracted diabetes in middle age and needs an operation in one eye. His consultant says it will be at least six months before he gets it. His general practitioner has told him that if this operation is delayed, his other eye will become affected and he could end up being blind. If he <Col N="1136" /> was a private patient, he would not have to wait. What type of country are we living in where the coffers are overflowing, yet a man may lose his sight because he cannot access the treatment he needs and he cannot afford to buy it? I am talking about the type of pain experienced by the young paraplegic who cannot start his rehabilitation because he is stuck on a hospital waiting list for an operation on his legs. I am talking about the anguish of a mother who is afraid to bring her children to her family doctor because she cannot afford to pay him, although she knows they need medical care and attention. I am talking about the 90 year old man who spent days on a trolley in an accident and emergency department because there was no bed for him. Is this what the Government means when it says it is paying special attention to the needs of the elderly?</P>
    <P>What about the people who provide for those needs? I am talking about a typical nurse in St. James's Hospital who works three 12 hour shifts a week and a further two 12 hour shifts to pay her £800 a month mortgage. A 60 hour working week for a nurse in an understaffed and over stretched hospital may be value for money in the eyes of the Minister for Finance, but it is not right and it is not sustainable. Our health service is staffed by people of the greatest dedication and professionalism. Is it any wonder they are worn out and worn down by their frustration at a Government which is incapable of addressing the needs of their patients? I have not outlined isolated instances because this is the experience of thousands of people who are forced to endure the deficiencies of an under funded and an iniquitous health service.</P>
    <P>We are tabling this motion tonight to highlight how common these experiences are and to affirm that the Labour Party is keeping the needs of patients on the political agenda in every way we can. We are reminding the public of the commitments the Government made when it took office and of the promises reneged on by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and all the others. They promised in their Government programme to deliver a customer focused health care service, to tackle the crisis in the hospital waiting lists and to increase income levels for eligibility for medical cards for large families. These promises are on the public record. However, after four wasted years not one of those promises has been kept. Failure is piled upon failure at the Minister's door. He has failed to tackle the hospital waiting lists, to deal with our two-tier system, to provide more beds in acute and non-acute hospitals, to develop community care, to support carers in the home and to cherish our children. The only difficulty we had in drawing up the list of failures of this Government was to decide where to draw the line.</P>
    <P>The argument in favour of a health service based on quality and equality is not new. When Dr. Noel Browne was Minister for Health, he attempted to tackle inequality in health care for mothers and children. He made the point at the <Col N="1137" /> time that in any two-tier system the better off will get the better service, while the worse off will get the worst service. He fought against means testing eligibility because it institutionalises inequality. He said that in medicine he did not see rich and poor people, but sick people. Dr. Noel Browne fought for the universality of health care, but the forces of reaction defeated him. The Labour Party is fighting today for the universality of health care. The forces of reaction are still with us in a new guise and in this Cabinet, but we do not intend to let them win again.</P>
    <P>We are seeking what other Europeans accept as their right &ndash; a good, fair, properly resourced and insurance based health system. It is an ambition shared by many people both inside and outside this House. Only 24% of Irish people are satisfied with our health service. That figure is 78% in Finland and 71% in Austria. Satisfaction is also high in France, which is not surprising since it does not have hospital waiting lists. French people live a good deal longer than Irish people. It is possible to provide a quality health system not just to meet the current needs but for an ageing population. France and other countries have done it. There will always be stresses and strains and further demands, but we do not yet have the major demographic challenges facing these European countries. However, we have a Government incapable of meeting the challenges facing us.</P>
    <P>It is worth comparing the Government's failure on health with the extraordinary planning, preparation and funding commitments to the establishment of Stadium Ireland. The Government could have chosen to set up a task force to create a world class health service. We could have had the equivalent of a Paddy Teahon or a Laura Megahy in place to take on the work of dealing with the management problems, the anomalies, the staffing shortages, the lack of patient responsiveness and the modernisation project that is demanded if we are to reach the objective of a 21st century health service. However, we do not have that commitment from the Government. We have two Ministers bickering over money, while the Taoiseach, as usual, keeps his head down and out of trouble in a Government which is bereft of direction.</P>
    <P>We have heard and I have no doubt we will hear a great deal tonight about the proposed health strategy. Drawing up a strategy when a Government is coming to the end of its term of office begs the question about what this Government is about. At a time when the Government has to defend such an appalling record of the failures listed in the motion, the exercise on which it is embarked is more about trying to rescue Fianna Fáil from the anger of the electorate than it is about reforming and transforming the health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Many have described the health system as a two tier system. I go a step further and say that it is a three tier system. There are medi<Col N="1138" /> cal card holders, those who make health contributions or subscribe to the VHI's plan B, and super plan people. The <i>modus operandi</i> of the health system is to question what insurance cover people have when they present for treatment. Patients are then streamed into a variety of levels of treatment, not on the basis of their health condition but their wealth, and how much they can afford to pay for insurance. Some wait one week for treatment &ndash; the super plan people. Others wait one year, while some wait forever. Many die while waiting.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable that patients are treated not because of how sick they are but how well off they are; not due to the condition of their heartbeat but on the depth of their pockets; not on the shortness of their cough but on the money in their wallet. It is outrageous that in the time of the Celtic tiger, in a society that describes itself as Christian, we are behaving in a way that was unacceptable 150 years ago. Patients, at their time of greatest need, are treated on the basis of their ability to pay. That this practice is rampant is grossly insulting in a civilised society.</P>
      <P>The role of money grabbing senior consultants deserves attention. Their greed knows no bounds and their power within the medical system is nearly as great as their greed. It is not the regional health boards which dictate policy in hospitals; it is the medical consultants. I served on a large hospital board in Dublin and saw consultants spend more time on committees dealing with their hip pockets rather than with their patients. They strove to ensure their money was protected and income enlarged.</P>
      <P>At the same time, junior hospital doctors and registrars were run ragged. Patients with medical cards who eventually get into hospital rarely see their consultants. If a senior consultant is involved, the patient who is supposed to be under his or her care does not have a snowball's chance in hell of being seen. A closed shop is operated. Consultants decide on their numbers. Nobody else is involved, not even the Minister for Health and Children, although he would like to be. The Minister does not have the bottle to tackle them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see. We will also see if the Minister for Finance allows the Minister for Health and Children to tackle the consultants. I doubt he will. Consultants ensure, due to the closed shop and the ensuing scarcity of consultants, their fees are extraordinarily high. It is time for the Minister for Health and Children to take them on.</P>

    <P>There are five medical schools in Ireland which have places to produce more than enough doctors to meet our needs. Instead, we produce them for export because the Government will not hire them. When it does hire them, it will not pay them and forces them to work in excess of 100 hours per week. Even then, it will not produce a <Col N="1139" /> system where doctors will be trained and further educated and promoted. It surrenders to the fat cats, the blockers, and the senior consultants who say, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has clear proposals and policies. We guarantee that if in government, we will ensure the level of sickness will be the test for treatment, not the level of wealth. There will be equal access to treatment which will be funded by a universal insurance scheme. We will make provision for beds, staff and theatres to ensure those in need in hospitals, out-patient departments and the community receive quality treatment when they need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important motion as health is a matter that affects all citizens. It is an old saying in County Westmeath that one's health is one's wealth. Ironically, at a time when the nation is experiencing an unprecedented level of wealth, sections of the health service are nearing collapse. This is not reflective of an economy held up as a shining example of success throughout Europe. If anything, our two tiered, under-funded, understaffed and overstretched health services are akin to what one might expect to find in a developing country.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware through contact with their constituents that access to the health service is an issue that causes incredible pain and frustration. It is underpinned by the philosophy that the poor must wait. Some weeks ago an aunt of mine was left on a trolley waiting for services. This is disgraceful. Who can crow about the wealth and prosperity of the country when such instances occur? It is bad enough that it happened in the 1940s and 1950s, when a particular person tried to root out the problems, only to have his efforts put down by reactionary forces. That person was Mr. Noel Browne, and if he was here today, he would do much considering the current level of wealth. That is the barometer by which to measure this issue.</P>
      <P>A parochial example, that of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, may help to illustrate the situation. It highlights the Government's mismanagement of the health infrastructure and indicates how the hospitals building programme has got bogged down. This issue exercising the people of Counties Longford and Westmeath relates to the completion of phase 2B of the hospital. This is a critical infrastructure, providing an upgraded, state-of-the-art facility to accommodate the medical requirements of the expanding populations in the two counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase 2A at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital provided for a new accident and emergency unit, a modern x-ray unit, an out-patient department and other ancillary facilities which were completed in July 1997 and fully operational in 1998. At the same time, a five-storey block &ndash; phase 2B &ndash; was also constructed. This was to be fitted out at a later date to provide the additional <Col N="1140" /> beds required for this busy and progressive hospital. The critical nature of this element of the infrastructure &ndash; which should be put in place without further foot dragging, side stepping and obfuscation from the Department of Health and Children &ndash; can be gleaned from the fact that the completion, equipping and staffing of the building will mean an additional 100 beds being made available for those counties.</P>
    <P>They are badly needed. In January each year, there has been 130% occupancy of the current facilities. Nurses must put beds side by side while staff struggle to do their professional best in difficult conditions. Yet, when they look out of the hospital they see the five-storey empty shell of phase 2B gathering moss. This is a scandal. It is no surprise that the people of Counties Longford and Westmeath are seething with justifiable anger when they observe the Taoiseach and Government championing their pet projects and securing the necessary finance to have them completed. What I am concerned about is the health of the people of County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in many sporting activities and I support the allocation of money to sporting organisations. Not, however, at the cost of people's health. A person only gets one chance to live. As Deputy Stagg pointed out, it is sometimes discovered that the numbers on waiting lists have decreased because some of the people had died while awaiting treatment. We need £40 million to complete construction of the facilities at Mullingar. That is small beer in terms of the great celebration the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announces each year in regard of our £2 billion or £2.5 billion budget surplus.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Health and Children is short of money, as a socialist who believes in the fundamental wellbeing of others and in helping those less well off than myself I have no difficulty in paying an extra penny tax in the pound. I am prepared to pay to ensure that ordinary people less well off than I am can obtain treatment. The Government is giving in to the greedy in our society and those who want everything for themselves. I would rather ensure that elderly people are cared for and if I have to pay to ensure that this happens I will do so, because I will be old one day and I hope the younger generation will care for me. If the Government does not want to charge me tax at a rate of 42%, let it charge me at 44%.</P>
    <P>This country is beset by the Progressive Democrats' philosophy, which epitomises what happened in Britain under Thatcher <i>vis-à-vis</i> the privatisation of services. It also epitomises the &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo; philosophy. I want neither hand, act nor part in that philosophy and I am prepared to pay extra tax if the Government cannot provide additional funding out of the budget surplus. People such as I should be allowed to pay for those unfortunate individuals who are obliged to lie on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> I am aware that there is a general election on the horizon and we are expecting news in Westmeath, where Fianna Fáil will have a Senator and a current Minister seeking election to the next Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the people will not be deceived any longer. The members of the electorate in Westmeath are intelligent and they will be on the streets by September unless the Minister makes an announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children in a matter of fact manner accepts that we have a two tier health service. Private patients get treatment which is better, faster than do public patients. The damage done by the cutbacks in the 1980s has not yet been overcome. Our citizens, who have built a first rate economy, cannot understand why our new found wealth has failed to deliver high quality health care accessible to all. The health system is not just based on ability to pay, but we have acute staff shortages in certain areas and lengthening waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The quality of life endured by many of our people is being destroyed because of the huge delays in access to health care. No Member on any side of the House is without a personal file of heart rending cases of people awaiting access to hospital. Hospital appointments do not carry any meaning now. I know of a constituent, a cancer patient who was admitted to Tallaght Hospital for further surgery in January 2000 and altogether presented on seven further occasions last year by appointment, before having the necessary procedure performed. Hundreds of my constituents have discovered that, having waited 20 years for it, they cannot gain admission to their own hospital when the need arises. As Maev-Anne Wren wrote in her series in <i>The Irish Times</i> quoting one administrator &ldquo;we are giving one set of taxpayers more rapid access to better treatment for the payment of very little extra money.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Glib phrases such as &ldquo;there is no point in throwing good money after bad&rdquo; and mooting daft solutions like taking private patients out of public hospitals will not tackle the crisis in those hospitals. We are spending less on our health services than most European countries. For example, between 1980 and 1996 only three EU member states reduced health spending as a proportion of GDP and the biggest reduction, at 20%, was in Ireland. However, greater investment must proceed hand in hand with structural reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Focus on lifestyle and development of primary care would take some pressure off the hospitals. After Ballymascanlon, however, it is impossible to know where the Government is going, other than to the country, having signalled that it acknowledges there is a crisis in health. Did it have to take four years for the Government to <Col N="1142" /> discover that fundamental reform of the health services is necessary? After Ballymascanlon we have the spectacle of Fianna Fáil, in the persons of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, taking both sides of the road. The focus groups have probably concluded that this formula is an electoral winner &ldquo;Sure the Dauphin from Cork would tackle the health crisis if only he was allowed. He is really a social democrat, you know.&rdquo; For others it is a case of thank God for Deputy McCreevy, only over whose dead body will more money go into the health services. It is called a Fianna Fáil each way bet.</P>
    <P>Access to decent health care ought to be a right taken for granted in a wealthy democratic society. However, to be a public patient in Ireland today is to be a second class citizen. The stress and anxiety that dominates the lives of so many people on waiting lists cannot be exaggerated. The fear of falling ill, knowing that admission to hospital in many cases is a lottery, dominates the lives of many people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the Taoiseach will not be deterred from building a monument to his memory at Abbotstown, no matter how much public money it takes or how many blank cheques have to be used to win the nominal allegiance of the sporting organisations. If Deputy Bertie Ahern wants to leave behind a monument as his political testament, why not invest £1 billion in a reform programme for the health services? That would truly be a monument which would improve the life chances and quality of life of all our citizens.</P>
    <P>How can we justify the spending of enormous sums of money on a monument that will be empty or partially empty, except on a few occasions annually, when patients are consigned to trolleys, when children are disfigured before they can obtain an appointment to see an orthodontist and when people die while on waiting lists? How can we justify a monument that must enter into a contractual arrangement to poach spectators from another stadium, when we are so short of hospital staff and necessary beds and when people short of money are bypassed in lengthening queues? The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, like his mentor, former Deputy Charles Haughey, is about to discover the extent of the crisis in the health services. What kind of Government puts a monument to vanity ahead of the real need of ordinary people for a decent health service?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Graduates of Irish medical schools are, more than ever, opting out of the profession for which they have been trained. The cost to the State of training each doctor and the subsequent loss to the health service is something about which we hear relatively little. Junior doctors are exercising their right to move away from a profession that is increasingly demanding and they relate mind-boggling stories about the length of hours worked, poor pay and the lack of promotional prospects. In respect of any other occupation, a body or organisation such as the Health <Col N="1143" /> and Safety Authority would set standards for the length of the working day and would penalise any employer who would expect an employee to work under such conditions and endure such levels of stress for such long hours. Would somebody be allowed to operate heavy machinery or operate a lorry for the same number of hours that junior hospital doctors are expected to work?</P>
      <P>Overworked doctors and other health care professionals do their best to ensure that patients are given a quality service. Any of my constituents who have been patients in hospital are frequently complimentary about the care they received from individual doctors. Patients, in general, are considerate and are aware of the strains within the health care system.</P>
      <P>There is, perhaps, one thing worse than the level of patient care in our hospitals, namely, &ldquo;after hospital&rdquo; care. One group of patients most at risk is that comprised of those with psychiatric illnesses. These people frequently complete a course of in-hospital treatment and are then left to find their way, unguided and unprotected, in the outside world. The people to whom I refer are in need of special monitoring and management, long after their hospital stay is complete. They are sent home, frequently to live alone, with a list of instructions and a bag of medication but without supervision, support and nobody to offer them advice. The most vulnerable are, once again, left to fend for themselves. These patients need good community support, dedicated social workers, sheltered housing on occasion and careful reintegration back into everyday life. A well resourced backup home care team is the least that should be provided if these patients are to have any chance of attaining a reasonable quality of life.</P>
      <P>Provision of information for patients and their families is another area which needs to be reviewed. Hospital management systems with responsibility for dealing with patient complaints have broken down, and many of my constituents regale me with details of indifferent treatment, dismissal by hospital management or, at best, a superficial public relations exercise. It is not good enough that patients should have to endure a protracted and often unsatisfactory hearing of their complaint. They invariably believe that all the cards are stacked against them and that they have little or no chance of ever being taken seriously. This syndrome applies, in particular, to the public patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this and many other reasons, the time has come to review the management structures of hospital systems. The new structures that allow the Minister for Health and Children to refer almost all questions to the appropriate health board when a parliamentary question is tabled are an indicator of the layers of bureaucracy within the system. The Department of Health and Children, the Minister, the health boards, hospital management and administration systems and individual consultants play a role in defining the <Col N="1144" /> quality of the health service provided for a patient. As a result of this myriad of layers of controls in the system, it is time to consider an ombudsman to oversee patients' rights and ensure the most effective and efficient hospital and health care system is available to all regardless of income.</P>
    <P>Reviewing and revising the structures of health boards is not the way forward. This is, at best, cosmetic and a new slimmed down version of each health board should be considered to ensure an effective delivery of health care, or perhaps a root and branch pruning should be given some considerable thought. Each patient should be clearly informed of his or her right to make a complaint and the process in place to have that complaint treated seriously. This suggestion is not intended to offer a facility for spurious and trivial complaints against the system. It is for this reason an ombudsman should be appointed to deal with the detail of the complaint and make the necessary arrangements to ensure justice is done for all sides. The ombudsman would be the first point of contact and alleviate pressure on the management of hospitals to allow them get on with their business, namely, management.</P>
    <P>The current two tier system of health care we experience should be phased out and ability to pay should not be the criterion on which we try to ensure the health of citizens. On a daily basis I hear stories of deferral of appointments, waiting lists that last for months or, in some cases, years and the chaos in accident and emergency wards in major hospitals. These are only some of the reports I receive on a daily basis. The health care system needs a complete review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;commends the Government for the unprecedented increases in health funding which it has been implementing since 1997;</P>
      <P>&ndash;recognises that this funding has led to significant improvements in a range of important services; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;endorses the process which has been adopted to facilitate the development of a new health strategy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus and her colleagues for tabling the motion which provides a welcome opportunity to set out clearly the Government's record on health and the series of initiatives coming together in the context of the most comprehensive and inclusive strategy statement on health services prepared to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should be in no doubt that the motivation behind this debate has nothing to do with a wish to discuss facts or have a serious debate about the future of the health system. Once again, the Labour Party and Fine Gael des<Col N="1145" /> perately hope that a continuous stream of attacks on health will help to reverse their ever more abject failure to gain the interest, much less the support, of the public. The tactics are as clear as ever: talk everything down, deny progress and try to hawk half-thought out and uncosted proposals as the all-purpose elixir for what ails us.</P>
    <P>The press release issued by Deputy McManus announcing the tabling of the motion is as transparent as it gets. At the head of the release it is stated that the purpose of the debate is not to promote a serious discussion but to mount what she termed a &ldquo;strong political attack&rdquo; on me and the Government. The scale of the motion's denunciation is impressive even by the standards of the Labour Party's daily hyperbole. Almost no area is left untouched where the House is asked to deplore our record. As such, it is difficult to know what to address in a short contribution. However, there is one simple message I can give to the Opposition: the Government has no fear of comparing records of action in health and presenting alternative visions for the future reform and development of health services.</P>
    <P>Last week I heard various members of the Opposition say that after four years the Government has done nothing on health. This follows a bizarre claim by Deputy Noonan on the 5 April edition of &ldquo;After Dark&rdquo;, and I quote directly because most seem to have missed it, that: &ldquo;the health services were significantly better . . . four years ago when I left the Department of Health than they are now. Now you can check that out objectively with anybody&rdquo;. If Deputy Noonan sincerely believes this, I look forward to him producing these objective observers, although I suspect that they will be about as easy to find as the people who fund Deputy Jim Mitchell's opinion polls.</P>
    <P>The objective evidence shows that the Government's programme of sustained expansion in health funding is making a difference. There are more doctors and nurses in our hospitals today than in 1997; more than 80,000 more treatments were carried out last year than in 1997; the largest capital investment programme in the history of the health service is under way; there are more than 3,500 more residential, day and respite care places for people with disabilities; and there are 400 more places in community nursing units for older people. These are real improvements helping real people and none of them was in place during the self-described golden days of Deputy Noonan's time in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Central to these improvements has been the doubling of health funding to over £5 billion this year. As has now become traditional, the Opposition has spent much time attacking the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It tries to present him as someone who has been slashing through the health service by refusing to provide new funding. It has one great problem: the Minister has allocated increases to my Department which dramatically outstrip those allocated by Deputy <Col N="1146" /> Quinn when he and Deputy Noonan were making the decisions.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to expect any element of consistency in the Opposition's critique of Government policy. Last December we heard Deputy Noonan say that the Government was spending too much. We subsequently heard Deputy Quinn say that the Government should listen to the European Commission's opinion that we run a tighter fiscal policy. Today, however, both parties want us to believe that they will match and exceed our spending record. There were no major fiscal pressures in 1997, but choices were made and these did not include giving health the same level of priority given to it by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. As with many other areas, the facts of health spending during his tenure in Finance show that he will be remembered much more fondly than those who preceded him and now try to reinvent themselves as champions of health spending through a spurious denunciation and misrepresentation of his record.</P>
    <P>One can see where the extra money is going in the fact that last year there were 500 more junior doctors and 15% more dentists working in the health service than in 1997. Nursing is an area where the Opposition loves to shout &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; in the House. The fact is, however, that by December of last year there were 1,774 more nurses working in the health service than in 1997. Many Deputies have steadfastly refused to acknowledge the existence of these extra working nurses. They also refuse to acknowledge the major expansion in the numbers training and the high level of demand for places on nursing programmes. We have increased training places to 1,500 and I am sure the House will welcome the fact that the number of applicants for nursing registration-diploma courses is up 21% on last year. We would have less problems filling nursing posts today if Opposition Deputies had created training places when needed. To be fair to Deputy Quinn, he has acknowledged that failure of planning during the rainbow Government's term in office.</P>
    <P>The continued implementation of the Commission on Nursing report is a key priority. Movement under the first action plan has shown what can be achieved by everybody working on a common agenda to improve the development, utilisation and rewarding of nurses. I am sure that Deputies will also be pleased to acknowledge that the increased funding which we have provided has meant that there were 625 more doctors and dentists working in the health system last December than in 1997. As part of this, there are more than 250 more consultants working in hospitals.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House accuses me of personally failing to implement the commitments made on working times and conditions for non-consultant hospital doctors. As in so many areas, the Opposition is choosing to ignore the facts. In this case, the facts of implementation amount to a bill of £90 million this year. The training fund <Col N="1147" /> has been established, overtime rates have been increased, senior managers are being appointed in hospitals to roster non-consultant hospital doctors' working hours, funding for locum cover has been increased and a phased refurbishment of doctors' residences has begun. The implementation of the deal is being pushed with commitment and speed. It is a record of action which I have no problem defending to anyone.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there has been a significant increase in the number of professionals in the paramedic grades. There were 1,631 more in December than there were in 1997. Overall since 1997 recruitment in the health sector has resulted in approximately 14,000 extra posts. For these professionals, just as for nurses, one of the biggest difficulties in filling new posts has been the lack of previous planning to create the necessary training places. In contrast to our predecessors, we have created new training places across the range of specialisms and we are also providing for future needs.</P>
    <P>These are the just some of the facts of where our dramatic increase in health funding is going. These are the inputs, and they are being felt in the level of service provision. Last year over 90,000 more treatments were carried out in our hospitals than in 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister clarify the figure for the number of treatments last year for the record? Was it 90,000 or 80,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 80,000.</P>
      <P>At the same time as refusing to acknowledge these increases, the Labour Party has asked the House to deplore the Government's record. I think it is worth taking some time to explore and compare records and policies in relation to waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The starting point is the obvious fact that too many people have to wait, and wait too long, for important treatments. Waiting lists are not uniquely Irish and they have not emerged recently. In spite of the major increase in hospital activity and the numbers of people receiving treatment, waiting lists are still there and they remain an issue which must be tackled. Our increased population, and in particular the increased number of people in groups likely to require hospital treatment, has been a key driver in the continued existence of waiting lists but there has also been a lack of bed capacity and a difficulty in catching up with previous under-investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy has been very clear. We have shown a consistent commitment to improving the situation in relation to public waiting lists. The figures show that the waiting list at the end of last December was 2,596 lower than it was in June 1997. Of course the proper comparison should be with the figure at the end of 1997, because this more accurately reflects the results of the Quinn/Noonan health settlement of January <Col N="1148" /> 1997. This comparison shows that the lists are down by 4,349.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies McManus and Mitchell come up with ever more ingenious ways of trying to pretend that the lists are worse today than they were when we took office, but no matter what way they try to twist the figures, they cannot get away from the fact that they are down. As in so many areas, when one compares this with their own record the results are striking. The Opposition are now presenting themselves as the champions of the public hospital patient, but they were nowhere to be seen during Deputy Noonan's golden era when public waiting lists actually increased by an unprecedented 6,600, or 27%. This figure does not even include the further rises at the end of 1997 which came as a result of their budget of January of that year.</P>
    <P>People will forgive the Deputies opposite for trying to forget the night of 22 January 1997, because that date marks an event which destroys any credibility which they, and particularly Deputies Quinn and Noonan, claim on this issue. It was on that night that they went through the lobbies in this House to vote through a budget which actually cut by 20% the funding dedicated to reducing public waiting lists. On at least three occasions I have directly called upon Opposition Members to explain their vote and why we should believe that they can be trusted to cut waiting lists if their record simply shows them cutting the waiting list funding. Unsurprisingly they have refused to reply. Tonight and tomorrow night there will be enough time available for them to end their silence and explain that damaging decision.</P>
    <P>The Government is well aware that the hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on elective beds because of the growing number of admissions through accident and emergency departments. Available data indicate that about two-thirds of all admissions now come through the accident and emergency departments in major hospitals.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. It involves the development of a long-term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and includes a detailed assessment of future bed requirements in response to increasing demand and changing demographics.</P>
    <P>In order to meet some of the immediate service difficulties facing the hospital sector, a £32 million investment package was provided aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients in the acute hospital sector, particularly over the winter period. The investment package has been targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants <Col N="1149" /> and 15 consultant anaesthetists. To date, 19 accident and emergency consultants and 12 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed, or have been offered or are being offered, temporary contracts on foot of the decision to recruit additional consultants. It should be noted that it typically takes over 12 months to recruit a consultant on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus could have been more supportive of that initiative, particularly in the light of Deputy Stagg's comments this evening and his perspective on who decides how many consultants go into the system. The Government took a decision on accident and emergency consultants and we are implementing that decision to the letter.</P>
    <P>The national bed review is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly. I will be bringing the findings of the study to Government with a view to agreeing an investment strategy for the development of the acute hospital sector. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government is already committed to investing £1 billion for the development of acute hospital services including new facilities, re-equipping and additional capacity.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of additional consultants is designed to reduce any unnecessary delays experienced by patients attending accident and emergency departments and to ensure that patients have improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision making service. Funding has also been provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Over 700 additional places were contracted under the initiative for patients who had completed the acute phase of treatment and who required continuing care in an alternative setting. I am satisfied that the initiative has been of significant benefit in freeing up acute hospital beds for patients requiring admission during the winter period.</P>
    <P>Finally, Comhairle na nOspidéal has commenced a review of the structure, operation and staffing of accident and emergency services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. The review will take into account the report of the medical manpower forum, policies of the Irish Accident and Emergency Association and the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgeons, international best practice, the views of health authorities, management and medical practitioners and other relevant matters. The finding of this review will inform future policy decisions in relation to the provision of accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>There are significant developments initiated by the Government which will have short, medium and long-term benefits. As the motion recognises, there is much more to our health services than hospital care, indeed one of the key challenges is to develop other elements of the system to a stage where some of the pressure on hospitals can be relieved. That is why we have accompanied the <Col N="1150" /> investments I have already mentioned with an unprecedented expansion in other services.</P>
    <P>For older people, a series of service improvements have been implemented. Over 400 additional beds have been provided in ten new community nursing units and over 1,000 day places per week have been created in new day care centres. Improvements have been and are being implemented in the home help service, in carers' support and a range of other community support structures. The Quinn/Noonan budget of 1997 gave £3 million to develop these services. This year's budget has built on past expansions and provided £33 million. These figures do not include the extension of medical card cover or the series of unprecedented increases in pensions provided through the budget of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to a philosophy of caring for older people is proven by the considerable injection of funding into the very services which are at the heart of care in the community &ndash; expansion of the home help services, specific assistance to carers, additional community support services such as public health nurses, care assistants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians together with the provision of new day care centres.</P>
    <P>Additional funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from £3 million in 1997 to an additional £7 million in 1998, an additional £12 million in 1999, an additional £28.5 million in 2000 while in 2001 an additional £33 million is being provided. These figures do not include additional funding for the nursing home subvention scheme or additional funding to expand medical card eligibility to the over 70s. The additional funding of £5.11 million since 1999 has resulted in approximately 880 posts to help cope with the growing level of dependency in extended care facilities. A sum of £34 million has been provided for the improvement and enhancement of existing services, for example, additional funding provided to community nursing units, day care centres, community services and for innovative approaches to the delivery of services for older people at a local level.</P>
    <P>Disability is another area where action has been prioritised and where results are already being seen. The historic under provision of essential services for people with disabilities has caused a major backlog of unmet needs and inappropriate placing. When we came to office we replaced a Government which talked a great deal about these services but had done nothing about putting in place a strategic plan to tackle the backlog. Our investment programme has already delivered 1,250 more residential places, 360 more respite places and 2,100 more day places for people with disabilities. For people with intellectual disabilities we are delivering on our promise to end the waiting list for service. The creation of new services and the erection of new buildings takes time <Col N="1151" /> but the results are there to be seen. As regards the historic level of funding that has been allocated to this sector, we should acknowledge the efforts of my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>The part of the Labour motion which fights off stiff competition to win the prize for gross distortion of the facts relates to our record on transferring people with intellectual disabilities who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals. An objective assessment of the programme already being implemented shows how we are making major progress towards ending this situation. I will cite the example of the situation in the Mid-Western Health Board. Some 85 persons in the board's area have been determined as being inappropriately placed. Of these, 36 persons will, over the next few weeks, begin to move from St. Joseph's Hospital, Limerick, to new facilities in Lisnagry. A further 25 will be accommodated in a new unit which has been built in Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis. In relation to the remaining 24 persons, planning is already under way to provide new facilities for them.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition was motivated by a wish to genuinely discuss developments in our health services it might have the good grace to recognise this progress. Unfortunately, the Government inherited a situation where there was no planning, no commitment and no resources to achieve this important objective. The motion also refers to child care policy to which the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, will respond in tomorrow's debate.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the dangers of tobacco use many times in the House and will do so again shortly when the Public Health and Tobacco Bill is published. Last year, we ended all newspaper and magazine advertising and sponsorship of tobacco. We will go further in controlling and minimising the impact of tobacco when the new Bill is published. We will also work with Commissioner Byrne at EU level on whatever measures may be required to ensure that the Union can take co-ordinated and effective action.</P>
    <P>Our record to date not only shows that we have been willing to invest unprecedented resources in our health services but that we have been working on a programme of credible and lasting reforms which are providing the essential foundation for a most comprehensive and ambitious health strategy for the coming years.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the 1994 health strategy which had many strengths, has been faulted for a series of fatal flaws. It was drawn up quickly, few people were involved in the development of the policies it addressed and, most fundamentally, it did not set out a real agenda for investment and development of the health system. The objective of achieving greater equity was mentioned but a plan was not outlined to achieve it. It was during the period of this strategy that the 1997 cutback in waiting list funding was implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> The starting point for the development of the new strategy has been a series of crucial reports which examine in great detail fundamental issues relating to the future of our health system. The Medical Manpower Forum report and the report on junior hospital doctors' working practices have shown the way forward to a radical improvement in the level and quality of hospital care. The Commission on Nursing has shown us what we must do to attract, train, utilise and retain nurses of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>A detailed study showing us how to work to significantly improve the effectiveness and accessibility of the full range of primary care services is under way. A value-for-money audit is for the first time detailing exactly how resources are deployed and utilised within the system. Vitally, a detailed strategic assessment of the bed capacity of our hospitals is being finalised.</P>
    <P>To these studies we are adding the largest public consultation ever carried out in the health sector. More than 2,000 submissions have been received from the general public and, in addition, a national consultative forum has been established, representing a large cross section of stakeholders. At the same time, detailed work is being carried out on how to bring diverse needs together into a coherent overall strategy. In order to give an outside perspective, we are also bringing together a group of independent international experts to evaluate the strategy as it develops.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has spent a great deal of time over the past week attacking us for not producing it now or for not having produced it earlier. The Opposition also seems to believe the Cabinet should not get involved in discussing matters before they are brought to it for a formal decision. The lessons of the Opposition's various health policy documents demonstrate clearly that our approach is the more credible and effective one.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has managed the extraordinary feat of facing both ways at once in its policy. It has both embraced a move to a universal insurance model and kept its distance from it. Fine Gael has dramatically under costed its proposals and often seems to be making it up as it goes along.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party has at least been consistent in pretending that it has the all-purpose answer to solving all of the ills of the system. Deputy McManus has spent countless hours claiming that the party has a comprehensive and worked-out plan. The problem is, however, that a full year after it was launched, she has failed to address any of the fundamental weaknesses in, or implications of, the policy. The policy states that hospitals will only get funding through negotiated contracts but Deputy McManus also claims that no hospital will lose out. Having promised that detailed costings and a legislative framework would be produced, we are still waiting. She has retreated behind an ingenious defence that an <Col N="1153" /> Opposition party cannot be expected to fully work out its proposals. Well, I am sorry, but if she claims to have the answer to all that ails us, details are required. It is not enough to point to her party's already outdated budget document and say that there will be enough health funding to go around so we do not need to be bothered with the details.</P>
      <P>Even a cursory examination of the Labour Party's policy shows a series of basic flaws. Generally speaking, insurance-based funding systems, whether social or private, significantly increase the percentage of funding which goes in administration costs. Similarly, an essential element of an insurance-based system is to have spare capacity so that there can be a meaningful negotiation of contracts. In that we have an under-supply of beds and it will take some time to build new facilities, from where will come the competition for contracts, which the Labour Party talks about?</P>
      <P>The Labour Party also talks about integrating primary and secondary care. How can this be done, however, if one system is based on ensuring community access and the other is based on competition for contracts? The Labour Party proposal would fundamentally undermine any real integration of primary and secondary care. The Labour Party might also like to explain who will plan new hospital facilities if all contracts are to be negotiated with a private insurer.</P>
      <P>Much of the party's discussion document is based on trying to suggest that there is an easy, off-the-shelf answer to everything. Deputy Quinn frequently talks about his sister party in Britain. He might perhaps look at its recent NHS reform document which pointed to the many failings of private and social insurance funding models and said that systems funded like ours are the least regressive. The bottom line about the orgy of self-congratulation which we have heard from the Labour Party, is that its plan is like the story of the emperor's new clothes &ndash; it is naked when it comes to costings, credibility and the capacity to deliver real improvements.</P>
      <P>Our record is clear &ndash; more funding, more doctors, more nurses, more treatments being carried out, more community care, more disability care places and the largest capital investment programme in the history of the health service. The difference between us and the Opposition is that we have not ever pretended that our work is done. We have always said that further dramatic improvements are required in health services. Progress so far is making a real difference to the lives of thousands of people throughout this country but there is much more which can and must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Opposition have spent a great deal of time thinking up new and creative ways of attacking the Government. They have whipped themselves up into a frenzy over the idea that the Government would discuss policies before being presented with decisions. As we have seen con<Col N="1154" /> firmed many times, this sterile posturing does not impress anyone, least of all the electorate.</P>

      <P>I am quite content to use my three minutes. I thank the Labour Party for introducing this motion and for the opportunity to discuss our health services. We on the Government side of the House are certainly very concerned about the health service. We are concerned about the historic under funding of the service, which goes back to the 1980s and for which all the political parties that were in Government during that period must bear responsibility. There was an historic cutback in the level of provision of health services. The first real attempt to undo this has been undertaken by the Government since the 1997 general election. There has been a significant increase in expenditure on the health service. There are many problems, which were outlined by Opposition speakers, including Deputy McManus who opened with a catalogue of them, but, overshadowing the debate, the Labour Party invoked the ghost of the late Deputy Noel Browne and said his plans for improvements in the health service were destroyed by unspecified dark, sinister forces of reaction. It may shock these Members to learn their party was among those which formed the forces of reaction which brought down the late Deputy Noel Browne and that he had to turn to this side of the House to implement what little part of his policy remained.</P>
      <P>The Minister demonstrated in his contribution a great deal of knowledge about the problems and how they should be addressed. Let there be no doubt that we, on this side of the House, require an inclusive health service which will provide the best medical care for all our citizens. I agree equal access to health care is a basic right of the citizen and there should be equality in health provision but that cannot be done by prohibiting private medicine. Such thinking might have been possible 20 or 30 years ago when we had ghosts further east to look at but it cannot be implemented today. However, a basic level of service should and ought to be guaranteed to all citizens. How that is done is another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> The speakers from the Labour Party were long on rhetoric but did not go into the specifics of their own interesting health policy. It proposes universal insurance for all patients but there would be difficulties with this. The first and obvious one would be the great administration costs and expenses associated with it. However, there would be a greater difficulty where the policy states public and voluntary hospitals would be required to cover their operating costs through income from health insurers and patient co-payments where applicable. In other words, where a small hospital was unable to win a service contract from an insurer it might be forced to restrict services or close. We witnessed screaming from Deputy Penrose who referred to the minds of the population of counties Longford and Westmeath being exercised and seething with rage. When the new compulsory health insurers begin to close essential services and entire hospitals in the BMW region we will see many seething with rage in the House. That would be a concomitant of the policy proposed by Deputy McManus.</P>
    <P>I accept, as an urban Member, there may be a case for rationalisation in the provision of provincial hospital services but an insurance company operating at one remove from those elected to run the State and those responsible for the local administration of the service should not undertake such rationalisation. These questions arise on the Labour Party policy but at least it has put forward a policy. The principal Opposition party seems totally confused. It is not a year since Deputy Shatter stated: &ldquo;Whether the necessary reform can be brought about by the introduction of a universal health insurance system is in question. What is needed is less, not more bureaucracy&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and congratulate the Labour Party for tabling the motion. The Minister referred to the grandiose policies he has introduced and the moneys he has spent but I would like to come back down to earth and outline what is happening on the ground. Hospital overcrowding is now so severe, the Irish Nurses Organisation conference was told, that a man on a life support machine had to be taken from his bed and placed on a chair overnight to make way for a more critical patient. That is the service being provided. Letterkenny General Hospital recently had to put an emergency plan, similar to that which would apply in the case of an airplane crash, into operation to find room for seriously ill patients, the conference was also informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospitals frequently must resort to ambulance trolleys to allow patients lie down. Patients have had to be housed in the coffee dock in Letterkenny General Hospital overnight. Patients were recently put in a confined room in a hospital normally used for plastering broken limbs. Some patients can spend three days on trolleys and never see beyond the door of the casualty depart<Col N="1156" /> ment while others develop further illnesses as a result of having to stay in casualty departments. The Minister stands indicted for supervising such a service given that it is his responsibility.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by the INO found that Naas General Hospital treats an additional 25% of its total bed capacity in its accident and emergency department and there is a lack of consistency in following admissions policies and bed management strategies aimed at alleviating the problem. Accident and emergency staff prioritising patient admissions tend to allow elderly and vulnerable people to be first in the queue. The survey also revealed how patients who arrive by ambulance are regularly left with no trolley on which to lie. One Waterford bed manager said she was the most hated person in the hospital. She also said: &ldquo;I am expected to pull beds out of thin air like rabbits out of a hat. I am a nurse, not a magician&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring regularly raises the issue of the orthodontic service, in which he has a great interest. I received a letter yesterday regarding a constituent from a consultant orthodontist. I had asked him when the constituent was likely to receive treatment. He replied: &ldquo;There is some confusion at national level which is hindering the delivery of orthodontic services. For this reason it is difficult to predict when we will able to see&rdquo; the person concerned. Why would a consultant orthodontist give me such information? What is happening to create confusion at national level such that the consultant orthodontist of the Mid-Western Health Board cannot even inform me when it is likely the person concerned will receive treatment? This is an important, necessary treatment for patients.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a local general practitioner who had received a reply regarding a patient from a consultant urologist who had received a referral request from him for an outpatient appointment. The urologist stated: &ldquo;Unfortunately due to the volume of referral requests and current service limitations the waiting time for this appointment is approximately two years&rdquo;. The GP has replied to the consultant and copied the letter to me. He stated: &ldquo;The two year delay is absolutely unacceptable to the patient and to me&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to respond to those two issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall when Fianna Fáil was on this side of the House in 1996 Deputies Cowen and Martin and many other members of the party lectured the then Government on problems in the health service and told us what they would do when in office. Fianna Fáil has been in government for 12 of the last 14 years. The previous Government was in office for two and a half years. Fianna Fáil preached to the public about what it would do in regard to the health service because it had received such a scalding in the election prior to that when the famous Charlie Haughey did not know what was happening and did not realise the health service was collapsing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> I heard the Minister say today that under this Government the waiting list had been reduced by 25%, from 32,000 to 28,000. I will tell the Minister the reasons those figures are down to 28,000. First, many families had to raise loans to pay consultants to treat their people privately and to pay for operations. Second, many health boards sent out letters to people who had already died calling them into hospital for operations. My colleague, Deputy McCormack, knows of such a case and I know of one in my own health board area. They are the reasons the waiting list figures are down. That is why the Government and its PR people are lecturing us about the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I listen to people in my clinics complaining about the health service on a daily basis. Last week I was in Belmullet and I heard from a woman whose 13 year old son is waiting to be called to St. Luke's Hospital. I do not want to get annoyed with Deputy Lenihan because if I do, I might say something I will regret. It is fine for Deputy Lenihan to talk about health services in Dublin but people in the west have to come to Dublin by train and sometimes they do not know if the train will even run. They come up to St. Luke's Hospital but they do not know how they will be treated.</P>
    <P>I recently had to ring Beaumont Hospital to try to get a woman admitted. She had been crying in my clinic with back pain which she had suffered for the past 12 months. I rang the person who dealt with administration in the hospital but he did not have much sympathy for this woman and he certainly was not a Fine Gael man. I suppose he was a hack who had been put into that position to deal with the general public but he treated me with disdain and disrespect. He lectured me about the health service and criticised the Minister as not providing enough money and staff and for putting pressure on the health services. I can tell the Minister, however, that we will not take lectures from him or from hospital consultants. If people are sick, they should be entitled to get the same service as the people who have private health insurance, whether it is VHI or whatever.</P>
    <P>I spoke to somebody in my constituency yesterday who heard me giving out on the radio last week about people on medical cards waiting to be called for operations. This person was paying VHI but was also waiting to be called into hospital. Even people who are paying for their own private health insurance cannot get called for the operations they need.</P>
    <P>The Minister sent out a signal last week through his PR people, who are the very best, but the taxpayer&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not make me name them because they are all colleagues up there on the back benches. The taxpayers are <Col N="1158" /> paying for the PR people. Last week, a signal was being sent out that the Minister would deal with the health services before the election. The impression was given that everything would be fine but the Minister's colleagues in Government disagreed. There is a programme on television called &ldquo;The Weakest Link&rdquo;. On it the contestants are asked questions and at the end of each round, they are asked to decide who is the weakest link. The Minister is the weakest link in this Government. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, told the Minister that he was the weakest link, that he was out and that the programme was over. The Minister, along with his colleagues in the Department, are the three weakest links because we have problems in every sector of the health services. People cannot get called for orthodontic treatment. There are 32,000 people on the waiting list. Deputy McManus talked about 12,000 in the Eastern Health Board area but the total is 32,000 nationally waiting to be called for orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>I put down a question to the Minister about cataract operations and the answer was that 2,500 people were waiting to be called. We are talking about a 20 minute operation to address a problem that affects the old. A woman came into my constituency clinic a number of months ago who was waiting to be called for treatment. She had a problem with one eye and the other eye was beginning to cause her concern. She begged me to tell her when she would be called for treatment but I could not give her an answer.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to take on the health boards, the programme managers and the PR people. I put down a Dáil question to the Minister recently. It took about six months to get a multi-page reply. I wanted to know the number of people employed by the health boards on a year to year basis over the past three years. There were reams of them &ndash; programme managers, assistant programme managers, press officers, assistant press officers, etc.</P>
      <P>The Minister has lost control of the chief executives and the power must be returned to the Dáil and to the Minister. We should start at the beginning by getting rid of the chief executives and the health boards. We should try to give the people back the services they deserve because they are paying enough taxes for them. People do not mind paying taxes but they want to be treated when they are sick. They want their families to be treated when they are sick and they do not want to have to beg politicians or doctors to bring them into hospital to be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked powerful language when he was on this side of the House. Fianna Fáil has been in Government 16 out of 18 years, and <Col N="1159" /> Deputy Moffatt is a great man for telling me what Fianna Fáil has done.</P>

      <P>The people are waiting in the long grasses for the Minister and the Ministers of State and if they are ready to go, we are ready for them.

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Labour Party motion because of the state of the hospital services in my constituency. The Minister spent some time in the constituency last week and I was interested to find out who accompanied him. I was told that local Deputies were available for the Minister's sneak preview of St. Joseph's Hospital and the county hospital, and to outline the various problems that existed in the area. I understand the health board sought ten additional nurses for St. Joseph's Hospital. I am told the hospital got sanction in January but the nurses still have not been appointed. If the Minister is boasting that there is a surplus of nurses and they will be trained, I do not understand why this problem has not been resolved.</P>
      <P>If the Minister goes to any hospital, and regardless of how nice he is to them, he will see that there is a real staff morale problem. There is a staff morale problem in the County Hospital in Ennis and that almost led to a tragedy for a next door neighbour of mine who began to suffer from a complaint and went into hospital on Wednesday night. Because she was not getting satisfactory treatment in the County Hospital in Ennis, she had to go into the Regional Hospital in Limerick on Sunday. When the consultant in the Regional Hospital saw her, she was operated on as an emergency. That speaks ill of the County Hospital in Ennis and its services.</P>
      <P>The major problem with the hospital in Ennis is that nobody has full confidence in the service. I do not know what will restore that confidence. There is a Fianna Fáil councillor on the radio morning, noon and night taking pot shots at the health board and the Minister. I do not hear his party disagreeing with him but as far as I am concerned, he seems to have the inside track. I prefer to use the system as it currently stands. Perhaps there should be a watchdog in the Department of Health and Children monitoring the way these hospitals operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major issue in County Clare is that we do not have a large hospital. There is a large hospital in Galway, Kerry and Limerick yet the 90,000 or 100,000 people in Clare do not have a proper system. All the inquiries, reviews, strategy meetings and consultations the Minister and his predecessors have had did not work. Dissatisfaction with Ennis General Hospital and with the ser<Col N="1160" /> vices is growing and if that hospital is closed, the people will have to go to Limerick and as the Minister knows, the accident and emergency service in Limerick is over-run with problems. We hear about those problems every day of the week.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to again raise the issue of job creation in County Donegal, in particular, Inishowen which has suffered further scale-down and closures in the past couple of weeks. Having discussed little else with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, for the past couple of years, and when every other county has done well in terms of job creation targets, we require a focused attack on the outstanding county which has not achieved such targets before there is any economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to host a symposium at which members of the Donegal task force which is, in effect, the county development board and members of Donegal County Council could meet clients of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, members of IBEC and ISME, and, if appropriate, members of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. I make this call as I believe that Dublin's employment difficulties can become County Donegal's employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>We often read notices in Dublin to the effect that staff are required. Such notices include details of the great wages on offer; yet, in many cases, the positions remain unfilled. In County Donegal, particularly Inishowen, in the past two years experienced and work-oriented people have been laid off, many of whom are being laid off for the third time as one textile factory after another closes. I again extend my sympathies to all concerned. Sympathy, however, is no substitute for action. If we can get enough people together, we can solve each other's problems. That is the reason I am calling for this symposium or workshop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is to be an event on 14 June for the north west. This is a great idea but it is not sufficient. We have the statistics to prove that County Donegal is a special case. No other county has the same percentage unemployment; yet, 1,734 people are on the back-to-work scheme. We need a follow-up day of our own as I am suggesting, to build on anything that may begin on 14 June. The Donegal county manager &ndash; a very capable man &ndash; and our representatives must be able to target packages at people whom we are aware have a vested interest in moving to a location outside Dublin. We are aware that we, in County <Col N="1161" /> Donegal, have more to offer many companies than most, a fact which can be confirmed by those who recently located in the county.</P>
    <P>I wish to see the development of an invest in Donegal network where people who have experienced business in County Donegal can mentor others into the county. I want a co-ordinator appointed at State level to ensure this is a process, not simply another event. I acknowledge the north west cross-Border launch in Dublin in which the Minister and her Northern Ireland counterpart, Sir Reg Empey, were involved. However, previous launches have been in vain without the necessary follow-up. I am asking for something more than a picture shoot.</P>
    <P>We, in County Donegal, are frustrated. At least one company has had a phoenix-like resurrection due to the fact that some of the textile businesses in Dublin acknowledged that they had work and no workers, while we had workers and no work. These two problems were combined and two resolutions took place.</P>
    <P>The same can happen in other sectors. E-bureau work could be carried out in County Donegal &ndash; secretarial items translated, typed, bound and sent to Dublin or any large centre. We could also carry out bulk mail or call centre activities for large organisations which cannot get the work done due to a lack of employees in Dublin. I mention these types of activity due to the fact that we have many people who are not in the young age group and do not have the skills to become involved in the more high-tech activities that we would also like to see expand into the county. Too often these people are forgotten.</P>
    <P>As regards higher skilled jobs, we also have much to offer. A great deal of thanks must be given to agencies such as FÁS which have put many hours into trying to assist people into upskilling courses. However, I call again for the other basic infrastructures we need &ndash; the upgrading of our road access in the A5-N2; the telecommunications promised under the national development plan that have been threatened by Eircom pulling out of the £37 million deal; the gas and electricity links, and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State are well acquainted with the details of our needs with which I have plagued them. I call on the Minister of State to initiate a course of action which will ensure Dublin's employment difficulties become County Donegal's opportunities. What we gain we will retain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I would welcome any initiative that supports increased employment and balanced regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's suggestion, it may <Col N="1162" /> be more appropriate for Donegal County Council and the county development board, in the first instance, to consider whether to approach the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to explore ways to help resolve difficulties regarding employment affecting both regions.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to achieving balanced regional economic development and the development agencies are fully aware of this commitment. In addition, County Donegal is in the Objective One region to which 50% of all new greenfield jobs that IDA Ireland is charged with bringing to Ireland must go.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall commitment to the regions, Enterprise Ireland is organising a showcase event on 14 June entitled, Into the Regions, which will be an opportunity to display each region to its best advantage to an interested group of Dublin-based companies and institutions. Comprehensive regional profiles are being prepared by all of Enterprise Ireland's regional offices. The brief on County Donegal will include the following areas: Letterkenny, including surrounding areas; Inishowen, to incorporate Buncrana, Carndonagh and Moville; and south Donegal, to include Ballyshannon, Bundoran and Donegal town. These regional profiles will be used to promote County Donegal at the event on 14 June.</P>
    <P>Within the past 12 months, it has become increasingly clear that there is a significant potential for mobility among Irish enterprise. Within the past two years a number of Dublin-based Enterprise Ireland client companies have decided to place their expansions in such locations as the north west region, including County Donegal. These include Dublin-based companies such as the Bromley Group, Eland Technology, Network 365 and International Test Technologies, all of which have decided to locate in Letterkenny. In addition, Forward Emphasis, another Dublin-based company, has decided to locate in Malin.</P>
    <P>This potential mobility comes not just from Enterprise Ireland clients. In addition, a sizeable number of large financial and commercial institutions are actively considering operations outside Dublin for their expansion activities. The development agencies aim to encourage this mobile trend and will take a proactive approach, including a concerted marketing effort to match expanding companies with regional options.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of developments since the report of the Donegal task force was published. These were outlined recently by the Minister at Question Time, but are worth re-emphasising. Donegal County Council has established a £5 million economic development fund, of which £3 million has been spent on land acquisition, incubation units, marketing and other initiatives. The telecommunications infrastructure is also being developed and the Department of Public Enterprise has announced 13 projects <Col N="1163" /> nationwide which will receive a total of £59 million. Three of these projects involve the development of infrastructure in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Aer Árann has been approved maximum Exchequer subvention of £3.9 million to operate a Donegal to Dublin air route from February last. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is working on a £35 million development for Killybegs fishery harbour centre which will take two and a half years to complete. Expenditure of over £l million was undertaken at other fishery harbours last year. An ambitious roads programme for the county has also been included in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies, including the Donegal County Enterprise Board, are committed to playing their part in the development of County Donegal by maintaining the maximum number of existing jobs and attracting new investment. The task force report looked primarily at economic matters, but other aspects are now being examined which will include an updated plan for the county.</P>
    <P>Access was identified as an issue that acts as a barrier, not just to job development, but also to tourism and other aspects of the development of County Donegal. It is not just a question of air access but also road access. In addition, the Government was involved with the authorities in Northern Ireland concerning the improvement of facilities at Derry Airport. We did this as many of the benefits resulting from Derry Airport go to County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the showcase event on 14 June will provide ample opportunity for the north west region to promote itself to Dublin-based companies and institutions. I would welcome any other local or private sector-led initiatives that will contribute to achieving balanced regional development and new opportunities for the Donegal region. I assure Deputy Keaveney and the people of County Donegal that the State agencies at all levels, along with the Government, will do their utmost to sustain existing jobs and create new ones in County Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The current crisis in the occupational therapy services provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority has reached alarming proportions. Last weekend, the health board on Old County Road advertised eight occupational therapist posts. This recruitment drive is intended to fill five existing vacancies and to replace a further three people who have indicated their intention to resign in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting times for patients in my constituency to be seen by an occupational therapist have now reached an unacceptable point and the quality of life for some people on the waiting list has <Col N="1164" /> deteriorated significantly. One of my constituents, who is aged 84 years, had to wait more than six months for the provision of a wheelchair because an occupational therapist had to advise on the case. This level of waiting time is surely not necessary for the provision of what must be a standard support.</P>
    <P>The South-Western Area Health Board intends to recruit an occupational therapist specifically dedicated to the needs of the elderly. I welcome this development and I hope it will help to improve the quality of life for those who have been waiting, in some cases for almost a year, for provision of occupational therapy services.</P>
    <P>The need for occupational therapy facilities is now so acute that Dublin Corporation, while assessing the needs of the elderly, has engaged its own private occupational therapists. The health board service can no longer cope with the demand within a reasonable time frame. The people who are intended to be facilitated by the corporation are being deprived, in effect, of a quality of life.</P>
    <P>However, the shortage does not only affect the elderly. Another of my constituents is a young girl, a student, who suffers from serious back problems. She has been told it will be a further year before she is considered for provision of the special bed she needs to make her life a little more comfortable. There are many more cases like those I have outlined but the message just becomes highly repetitive.</P>
    <P>Occupational therapy, by its nature, is a service that is needed now, not in 12 months or two years. The number of students who are accepted each year to study occupational therapy is relatively small in comparison with the need for therapists. The Minister should review the intake of students into occupational therapy courses in the State and make provision, as a matter of urgency, for additional places on the courses. That eight vacancies exist for occupational therapists in one relatively small geographical area is an indicator of the gap between supply and demand.</P>
    <P>The inadequate staffing is not just about supply and demand. Just as in the medical profession, many occupational therapists are opting out of the public service because of the pressure and demands. Promotional opportunities are limited and the stress and time demands are becoming more acute. The quality and level of occupational therapy being provided is seriously compromised through insufficient staffing. More importantly, the quality of life of a large number of elderly people could be significantly enhanced if an adequate occupational therapy service could be provided. I ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to review the provision of occupational therapy services so that both their level and quality can be upgraded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of occupational therapy services to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the relevant health board and, in this case, the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the regional chief executive of the authority that two issues affect provision of occupational therapy services, increasing demand and recruitment difficulties. In relation to the former, I am advised that the decision by people to remain in their own homes and avail of occupational therapy, together with the complexity of cases and problems arising out of requests to receive treatment at home, has placed increased demands on the service. Furthermore, the regional chief executive has informed me that the difficulty in recruiting occupational therapists has also contributed to delays. The authority states that the three area health boards are making every effort to address this problem through active recruitment campaigns.</P>
      <P>The study on the current and future supply and demand conditions for certain professional therapists which my Department commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to conduct is expected to be published shortly. Among the issues to be addressed by this study is the number of additional training places required for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. Through the Higher Education Authority the possibility of increasing the number of training colleges as well as training places will also be addressed. In the meantime, following contacts between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science, the number of occupational therapist training places was increased by five places in 2000 and a further additional five places per annum will be provided over the next three years.</P>
      <P>The expert group on various health professions reported in April 2000 and recommended that talks begin between the parties on the establishment of a new grade of clinical specialist in the therapy grades. Following discussions between IMPACT, the Health Service Employers Agency and officials of my Department, employers were advised last week of the creation of this new grade. The establishment of this grade allows for the recognition and reward of those with a high degree of clinical expertise. By providing an avenue of career progression for those who do not wish to move into management it will also serve as a retention mechanism. Employers have been notified of their allocation of posts, along with details of qualifying criteria and post responsibilities, to enable them to draw up individual job descriptions for the post. The operation of these new posts will be the subject of an evaluation process after 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the implementation of the expert <Col N="1166" /> group, the criteria for the upgrading of therapists from basic grade to senior have been improved. On this basis, a survey of all employers was undertaken to identify posts which would meet these new criteria and in December of last year sanction was given for the upgrading of these posts. Approximately half of all basic grade therapy posts were upgraded through this process.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to point out that additional revenue funding provided to services for older people has been increased significantly in recent years, from £3 million in 1997 to an additional £7 million in 1998, an additional £12 million in 1999 and an additional £28.5 million in 2000. In 2001, an additional £33 million will be provided. When nursing home subventions are included, the investment for 2001 will total more than £47 million. A proportion of the development funding available this year has been targeted at the provision of additional community supports, that is, nursing and paramedical posts. It is intended to improve these community supports in the coming years, leading to an enhancement of service provision.</P>
    <P>This Government has also significantly increased funding for physical and sensory disability services and, since coming into office, has provided additional funding of just over £107 million for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. This additional funding includes a total of approximately £55 million additional ongoing revenue &ndash; £5 million provided in 1998, £9 million in 1999, £17.823 million in 2000 and just under £23 million this year &ndash; for the maintenance and development of services, including paramedical services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health boards, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure the improvement of the occupational services on offer to older people.</P>

      <P>The seven O'Hara carriages and associated tack were gifted to the State in 1952 by Mr. Donal O'Hara, Annaghmore Estate. They remained at Annaghmore until 1963 when they were transferred to Dublin. They are currently in storage in the National Museum facility at Inchicore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The O'Hara's recall that when the carriages left Annaghmore they were in pristine condition. The condition of the carriages, which have been in storage for the intervening 48 years, has deteriorated considerably and they are in serious need of conservation. A museum would be expected to <Col N="1167" /> maintain, if not improve, the condition of items in its care.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, the Ballymote Community Enterprise Company has worked with FÁS and other State agencies on the development of a transport museum concept in County Sligo with the O'Hara carriages as a centrepiece. In 1998, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, who turned the sod in the theme park, granted permission to lend the carriages to the Ballymote enterprise company for display, subject to its building and maintaining a museum to acceptable and professional standards of display, security and staffing as stipulated by the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Ballymote Community Enterprise Company is committed to building a modern professional museum in Ballymote and is in a position to pledge £300,000 &ndash; 10% &ndash; towards the total cost of the project. A business plan has been completed, architectural plans have been drawn up and a funding package is currently being compiled. It is envisaged that the museum will open in 2003 but it cannot do so if the O'Hara carriages are not in suitable condition for display.</P>
    <P>The museum will portray the history of the O'Hara carriages and transport in general in County Sligo during the period of the carriages' use with particular reference to the social, cultural and economic climate of the day. The seven horse-drawn carriages include three covered vehicles &ndash; two large private coaches and a brougham, a convertible landau, a sleigh, an open phaeton and a wagonette. It appears that most of these luxury vehicles were built throughout the second half of the 19th century for successive O'Haras of Annaghmore.</P>
    <P>The transport museum will be located in Ballymote town park, a picturesque 15 acre park in which the ruins of Ballymote Castle are located. Ballymote dates its foundation from the building of this castle by Richard de Burgo, the Red Earl of Ulster, in 1300. The company's primary interest and objective in the transport museum concept is the promotion of the environmental, educational, cultural and economic welfare of the Ballymote community, particularly with a view to the creation of much needed employment in the area. The creation of a contemporary transport museum in County Sligo would serve an educational, entertainment and research function for the county and beyond.</P>
    <P>The core museum functions of presentation, interpretation, research and collection will be supported by a commercial function, including a cafe, shop, the construction and restoration of horse-drawn carriages, a model train, carriage rides and carriage driving facilities. It is hoped the museum will open within budget by Easter 2003. The museum, which will appeal to all market sectors through careful marketing and customer care <Col N="1168" /> services, will be businesslike and fiscally responsible. It will provide a meaningful visitor experience <i>via </i>the transport theme which will address issues of identity. The museum will brand Ballymote as the carriage capital of Ireland and County Sligo as the carriage county. It will serve as a centre of excellence for Irish carriage building and research. I look forward to hearing what funding may be provided to conserve these carriages which tell a wonderful story.</P>

      <P>In 1952, the O'Hara family donated six 19th century carriages and one sleigh to the National Museum. The majority of the carriages are Irish made and constitute an important and unique collection of Irish made carriages. That the collection belonged to a single family is also unusual. The carriages are currently stored in National Museum stores in Inchicore, County Dublin. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands understands from the National Museum that it intends to move the material to Collins Barracks in the near future.</P>
      <P>Overall, the transport collection of the National Museum is quite small and the O'Hara collection is the largest single such collection held by the museum. In recent years, the National Museum has been in consultation with the O'Hara carriages museum project in Ballymote, County Sligo, on the possible return, on loan, of the carriages to Ballymote.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the Minister granted permission in principle for the loan of the carriages to Ballymote. Such a loan must be based on the loan agreement operated by the National Museum. This standard agreement covers such issues as the security, display and preservation of the material on loan. The Minister understands the project's promoters are currently endeavouring to construct a suitable building to meet the National Museum's standards of staffing, security and environmental control. A feasibility report, concept report and business plan have been prepared and an application has been made to the Department under the ACCESS capital funding scheme. This application is under consideration and a final decision is expected in the near future. The issue of the collection's conservation will be considered when the question of funding for the building has been addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, a Garda sergeant and two gardaí took the almost unprecedented step of vacating a Garda station in Muff, County Donegal, amid fears for their health and safety. The Muff Garda Station, which was built almost 100 years ago, was condemned as unfit for human habitation in the 1970s. One can understand the frustrations of the gardaí attached to this station. Last November, they threatened to walk out but <Col N="1169" /> suspended the threat due to last minute negotiations which promised urgent attention to the problem. The necessary repair work has not been carried out, however, resulting in last week's drastic action.</P>
      <P>The station is a two-storey building but only one downstairs room can be safely used. The only toilet in the building is located in an upstairs room which is dangerous to enter. The remainder of the building is crumbling from rising and descending damp and dry rot. It is a disgrace to the State that gardaí should be obliged to operate out of a derelict building.</P>
      <P>The town of Muff straddles the Border and the dilapidated station presents a terrible image to anyone entering Donegal from Derry. How can any Minister or Government justify gardaí working in such Dickensian conditions? While we may be enjoying the benefits of a First World economy, the conditions under which gardaí are operating in Muff are nothing short of Third World standards. How can the Minister expect the gardaí to operate in an efficient manner in a Border station under such conditions? Can he point to any other profession whose members would be expected to work in similar conditions? It is past time proper premises were provided at Muff to enable Garda personnel to carry out their duties in a civilised and dignified manner. Will the Minister of State give an undertaking this evening that proper premises will immediately be made available at Muff, a pivotal and strategic Border location?</P>
      <P>A portacabin was delivered to the station last weekend. Does the Minister seriously expect gardaí to operate efficiently out of a portacabin? A new Garda station should have been provided years ago. As an interim measure, I suggest that the former customs station built in the 1970s which is currently vacant could be used as a temporary station while a new station is being built. The customs station is probably State property in any event.</P>
      <P>The situation at Killybegs Garda station in my constituency is equally bad. Gardaí there have threatened to join their colleagues in Muff due to the existence of sub-standard conditions at the station. Killybegs gardaí have been promised a new station for many years but, to date, little or no progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has reached the stage where the local parish priest, Fr. Lorcan Sharkey, has agreed to accommodate the Killybegs gardaí temporarily in the parochial house until repairs are carried out or a new station is provided. While we all applaud and recognise the generosity of the parish priest in offering the parochial house as a temporary station, it is the duty of the Minister and the Government to act. The Minister should give a guarantee and an undertaking in the House &ndash; I regret that he is not present but I hope the Minister of State will have something to say &ndash; that <Col N="1170" /> the two stations will be immediately upgraded and proper accommodation and facilities provided in order that gardaí can carry out their duties with the efficiency and professionalism we have come to expect of them.</P>
    <P>When in opposition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform carved out a personal reputation for law and order and zero tolerance. I witnessed his performances in the House, but the lack of proper Garda accommodation in County Donegal, particularly Muff and Killybegs, is not conducive to these worthy objectives. The ultimate responsibility for providing adequate accommodation rests with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. As he may be aware, the Minister answered a question from Deputy Keaveney on the matter in the House today. The position is that necessary, temporary accommodation has been provided for the gardaí to the rear of the existing station at Muff. Moreover, negotiations are being undertaken by the Office of Public Works to secure a suitable and permanent new location for the gardaí in the town.</P>
      <P>In general, the Minister is aware that certain stations have recently given rise to particular difficulties for the members working in them. This includes the station at Muff. He acknowledges that the standard of accommodation in some stations is less than ideal, but believes that any fair analysis of his involvement to date, as Minister, must take account of the continuing efforts being made to progress the Garda building programme. In the general context of providing adequate and proper accommodation for all gardaí, the Government has significantly increased the allocation for capital works from £7 million in 1997 to £19.5 million in 2000. Since 1998, in excess of £51 million has been allocated in the Vote of the Office of Public Works for capital works on Garda properties. By any standard, this is a substantial sum. Similarly, since 1998, a sum of just under £21 million has been secured in the Garda Vote for necessary maintenance works to Garda stations. The Minister increased this allocation from £3.37 million in 1997 to £7.1 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>There is still much to do and the Minister is determined that an appropriate level of funding, and more if possible, will continue to be provided for this necessary work. However, I wish to point out that progress in this important area will only be made with the co-operation and goodwill of and sensible and sensitive approach from a number of sources, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda authorities and representative associations and the Office of Public Works, which is financially accountable for capital works to Garda properties. Such co-operation has always been forthcoming to date and the Minister will seek to ensure everything possible is done to improve accommodation facilities for all serving members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Gardaí occupy some 703 Garda stations and other units of accommodation around the country, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda headquarters and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied by them were built before the foundation of the State and were designed for a different era. This extensive resource, while invaluable in guaranteeing the provision of police services for the community, creates its own unique maintenance and refurbishment demands. Consequently, all Garda accommodation is continually <Col N="1172" /> under review to ensure it meets the operational requirements of the force. Where that is not the case, necessary works are prioritised and completed with the appropriate degree of urgency to ensure, as far as is feasible, the ordered, timely and economically efficient construction or major refurbishment of Garda stations as policing requirements demand and overall priorities allow.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 January 1999 under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. The FSAI is a science-based agency whose function is to ensure that food produced, marketed or distributed within the State meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.</P>
      <P>According to the FSAI, pathogenic microorganisms exhibiting multi-drug antibiotic resistance, have been responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning in humans. However the link between these multi-drug resistant pathogens and imported foodstuffs has not been made. At the end of 1999 the FSAI, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development started an enhanced poultry monitoring programme. The purpose of this programme was to monitor the quality and safety of poultry products circulating on the Irish market, and included a study of the incidence of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter and Salmonella in poultry meat, both domestically produced and imported. This study was carried out last year and approximately 3,000 samples of raw poultry meat and 700 samples of cooked products were examined. The results will be published within the next few months. In an extension to this project, the FSAI in 2001 is funding further work with the isolates of Campylobacter from last years surveillance work. This exercise will involve genetically mapping the organisms isolated, and comparing them to genetic maps of organisms that have been involved in human food poisoning outbreaks, and also organisms that have been isolated from animal sources. This work may go some way to examining the link between foodstuffs and antibiotic resistant pathogens in humans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, at the request of my Department, the National Disease Surveillance Centre has <Col N="1174" /> submitted a report making recommendations in relation to the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland. The recommendations set out in the report are currently being examined with a view to implementation of same at health board level.</P>
    <P>In fulfilment of the European Commission's commitment to ensuring that the highest levels of health protection are offered to the European consumer, the Commission established the Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, in the Directorate-General for Consumer Policy and Consumer Health Protection, in April 1997.</P>
    <P>The principal mission of the FVO is to monitor and control how member states and third countries implement EU legislation on food safety, animal health, plant health and animal welfare, and to contribute towards the maintenance of confidence in the safety of food offered to the European consumer. The FVO fulfils this mission by carrying out a programme of inspections to monitor the performance of competent authorities, including audits and on-the-spot inspections of individual establishments, in both member states and third countries.</P>
    <P>The FVO aims to ensure that imports into the EU are safe and produced under conditions at least equivalent to those in the EU. EU directives and regulations set the standards to be met by animal products originating in the EU and also set down equivalent standards in relation to imports.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to imports of poultry products from outside the EU, strict rules governing the importation of such products have been put in place at EU level. Countries wishing to export poultry products to the European Union are first required to demonstrate that they have and can maintain safety standards at least equivalent to those applicable in the EU. In particular, the country of origin and establishment in which the poultry meat was produced, must be approved in advance by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Normally a country will only be included after the FVO has carried out an initial inspection of the control systems in the applicant country and has recommended that it be included on a list of approved countries. In addition, once a country has been included on an approved list, it must provide a list of all establishments in that country that have been approved as meeting the required standards set down for export to the EU. It must also present annual plans which demonstrate the official measures in place to detect levels of chemical residues, including antibiotics. The granting of approvals is dependent on such factors as the poultry health status of the country, adequacy of veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices.</P>
    <P>The rules governing the importation of food of animal origin into the European Union require that all such imports must come through designated border inspection posts, BIPs, authorised and equipped to carry out specified checks and <Col N="1175" /> controls. On arrival in the EU, third country poultry meat is subjected to an &ldquo;official inspection&rdquo; at the first port of arrival. This includes checks on accompanying documents, on identity and labelling, as well as random physical checks on the product itself. If these checks indicate that everything is in order, importation is authorised and thereafter the poultry meat may circulate freely in the EU.</P>
    <P>Imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring in Ireland, because as a member of the European Union we are obliged under European legislation to allow free circulation of legally imported goods.</P>

      <P>The numbers on waiting lists by hospital and speciality and the waiting times, in the format collected by my Department, have been communicated separately to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The total number on hospital waiting lists, as at 31 December 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, is 27,857. This is the lowest waiting list figure since the December 1996 quarter and represents a decrease of 8,998 or 24.5% on the figure at the end of December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between December 1999 and December 2000 the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 66%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 50% and the number waiting for orthopaedic services for more than 12 months decreased by 45%. During the same period, the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by 56%, the number waiting for general surgery for more than six months decreased by 53%, the number waiting for ophthalmology <Col N="1176" /> services for more than six months decreased by 37% and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 20%. These welcome reductions have been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no adult waits longer than 12 months and that no child waits longer than six months for treatment. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is now at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of elderly or physical and sensory disability services to individuals is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>My Department established the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database Development Committee to prepare detailed proposals for the establishment of a national physical and sensory disability database on the specialised health and personal social needs of people with a physical or sensory disability. The primary purpose of the database will be for planning services developments, prioritising service needs and assisting in resource allocation decisions at national, regional and local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As very many of the people who suffer from Parkinson's disease are in the older age group, <Col N="1177" /> they will benefit from the improved level of services which my Department has put in place for older people since coming into office. The policy of the Department of Health and Children is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with the wishes of older people, as expressed in many research studies; to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies; to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to this philosophy of care is proven by the considerable injection of funding into the very services which are at the heart of care in the community, viz. expansion of the home help service, specific assistance to carers, additional community support services i.e. public health nurses, care assistants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians together with the provision of new day care centres.</P>
    <P>Additional funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from £3 million in 1997 to an additional £7 million in 1998, an additional £12 million in 1999, an additional £28.5 million in 2000 while in 2001 an additional £33 million is being provided. These figures do not include additional funding for the nursing home subvention scheme or additional funding to expand medical card eligibility to the over 70s. The additional funding has resulted in approximately 880 posts approved to services for older people between 1997 and 2000. Between 1998 and 2000 more than 400 additional beds have been provided in ten new community nursing units and over 1000 day places per week have been provided in ten day care centres.</P>
    <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association made a submission to my Department which sought to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new effective complex therapies for many disorders such as Parkinson's disease becoming available. The challenge is to develop an integrated and co-ordinated health and social welfare system that is geared towards the needs of the individual.</P>
    <P>Comhairle Na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the health Acts and to specify qualifications for such appointment. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to services. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I have requested Comhairle Na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related <Col N="1178" /> issues. The need for additional investment in neurological and neurosurgical will be considered in the light of this review, other competing priorities and the availability funding. I look forward to receiving An Chomhairle's report in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland concerning the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and the 1999 nurses pay agreement.</P>
      <P>The Government intends to make formal decisions on the recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions following detailed consideration of the report which was published on 31 January 2001. The Government will then move to establish the working group, provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to advise on implementation of the relevant Government decisions. The working group will comprise representatives of the public service unions, relevant Government Departments, and other appropriate bodies.</P>
      <P>The Commission's recommendations have implications for all parties having an interest in public service pensions &ndash; the Government, public service employers, trade unions, pensioner associations, such as the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland, individual public servants, and pensioners, as well as the taxpayer. For this reason, the Government is taking particular care in examining the report.</P>
      <P>When publishing the report, the Minister for Finance commented on the Commission view that its recommendations represented an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the measures in the report as a whole. As he stated then, he expects this to be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the Commission's report. It would therefore be inappropriate to address specific issues in isolation at this stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the 1999 nurses pay settlement, the standard parity criteria whereby retired nurses benefit from adjustments made to the salaries applicable to the grades in which they served before their retirement continue to apply. The Retired Nurses Association's concerns relate specifically to the senior staff nurse post, and to red-circled allowances payable to deputy nursing officers, theatre-night sisters and public health nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The senior staff nurse is a new post created as part of the 1999 settlement. Staff appointed to these posts will benefit from the rate for the post <Col N="1179" /> on retirement. The senior staff nurse rate does not, however, apply to pensioners who retired prior to 5 November 1999.</P>
    <P>With regard to the red circled allowances referred to above, these allowances only apply to nurses who were in employment on the effective date, 16 November 1999. As pensionable allowances are only taken into account at retirement where actual moneys have been paid, and contribution in respect of such payments have been made to the superannuation scheme, it follows that these allowances cannot be applied to pensioners who retired before the effective date.</P>
    <P>These issues have been raised by the Nursing Alliance and discussions have taken place under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency. In this context, my Department has confirmed with the Department of Finance that the approach being taken is consistent with public service pensions increase policy. My policy adviser, accompanied by officials from my Department's nursing policy division, met with a delegation from the association on 9 May 2001 and explained the position to them.</P>

      <P>The issue of violence against any health service worker is a very serious matter. Last year each health board was asked to submit details of a review of their security arrangements in their accident and emergency units, and to identify deficiencies. Following that review I was able to allocate £1 million to improve security in accident and emergency departments. This money was allocated to address issues such as additional security personnel, installation of CCTV and training of staff in how to handle aggressive patients.</P>
      <P>In February of this year I met with the Health and Safety Authority, and one of the issues on the agenda was violence in the work place. The Health and Safety Authority informed me that they plan to step up the number of reviews in hospitals in relation to all health and safety issues, of which work place violence is an important issue. I welcomed this development, and have since written to the chief executive officer's of all health boards informing them of the need to take all necessary measures to address the risk to health service staff. I have also requested that the HSEA would meet with the alliance of health service unions to discuss the implications of Health and Safety Authority reports.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of the Report &ldquo;Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: an Exploratory Study&rdquo; by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I established a broad-based working group towards the end of 1999 to advise me on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. It is chaired by Dr. Desmond O'Neill, Consultant Physician in Medicine of Old Age. The terms of reference of the working group are to advise on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to elder abuse and, in this regard, to make recommendations in relation to such of the following matters as it considers appropriate: definitions and terminology, identification and screening procedures, assessment protocols and procedures, management of sensitive information, recording and reporting procedures, inter-agency communications and referral practices, intervention issues and procedures to evaluate their impact, any necessary changes in legislation and legal procedures, training of relevant staff in the statutory, voluntary and private sectors, the need for appropriate structures to deal with elder abuse.</P>
      <P>The group includes representatives from my Department, health boards, the Garda, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation, the Association of Home Help Organisers and voluntary organisations who represent the interests of older people. The group also includes a consultant physician in geriatric medicine, a consultant in the psychiatry of old age, a consultant psychiatrist, a general practitioner and a clinical psychologist. It has drawn up a comprehensive two year work programme which will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, development of a training brief, the organisation of pilot projects, implementation of awareness and training programmes, preparation of evaluation report, and culminating in the presentation of a final report to me. I am providing significant resources to ensure that the work is completed within the time frame envisaged.</P>
      <P>Draft policies, procedures and guidelines, drawn up by the working group, are at present being tested in pilot projects which were recently commenced in two community care areas. Training programmes have been provided for staff members and ongoing evaluation is taking place. The main purpose of the evaluation is to assess whether the draft policies, procedures and guidelines in the identification, assessment and management of elder abuse, are appropriately designed and effective in the two health board areas. The working group has met on 15 occasions. It set a deadline of 31 December 2001 to issue a report and recommendations. Although valuable time was lost in getting people together for training sessions, due to the foot and mouth restrictions, the group is reasonably confident of finishing its work within the target date.</P>
      <P>The group will not be issuing any interim reports. I look forward to receiving the working group's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of issues relating to the provision of services for older people were raised during the Irish Nurses Organisation conference which was held recently.</P>
      <P>The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is twofold &ndash; first, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes, and secondly, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Nursing Homes Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency. The question of admission to a private nursing home is a matter between the patient and the owner of the nursing home.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years and a health board may at the time of registration, or subsequently, impose conditions in relation to registration. The regulations provide for periodic inspections at least once every six months by the health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations provide that the registered proprietor and the person in charge of the nursing home shall ensure that when a person requires physiotherapy, occupational therapy or other health service, such service is made available by the registered proprietor or by arrangement with the health board. These services may be provided by a health board to a nursing home at the request of the registered proprietor or person in charge upon such terms, charges and conditions and to such extent as the health board may determine, following discussion with the registered pro<Col N="1183" /> prietor of the home. It is also open to a patient to make private arrangements for the provision of these services if they so wish.</P>
    <P>From studying reports of the INO conference, it appears that the call for the appointment of an Ombudsman for Older People stemmed from the absence of legislation to deal with possible cases of elder abuse. The Deputy will be pleased to learn that I have established a broad-based working group to advise me on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. It is chaired by Dr. Desmond O'Neill, consultant physician in medicine of old age. The terms of reference of the working group are to advise on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to elder abuse and, in this regard, to make recommendations in relation to such of the following matters as it considers appropriate: definitions and terminology; identification and screening procedures; assessment protocols and procedures; management of sensitive information; recording and reporting procedures; inter-agency communications and referral practices; intervention issues and procedures to evaluate their impact; any necessary changes in legislation and legal procedures; training of relevant staff in the statutory, voluntary and private sectors; the need for appropriate structures to deal with elder abuse.</P>
    <P>The group includes representatives from my Department, health boards, the Garda, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation, the Association of Home Help Organisers and voluntary organisations who represent the interests of older people. The group also includes a consultant physician in geriatric medicine, a consultant in the psychiatry of old age, a consultant psychiatrist, a general practitioner and a clinical psychologist.

      <P>The provision of ambulance services to the Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth areas is the responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board, NEHB.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the board and I have been informed that it intends to progress the commissioning of an ambulance station at Kingscourt within funding of £160 million approved under the National Development Plan. While activity levels in the area are not particularly high, the board has recognised that with continuing population growth in the NEHB region, a station in Kingscourt would act as a feeder station to existing stations, as well as improving response times within this area. I understand that negotiations are on-going between the board and the local authority with a view to providing and developing a suitable site for this development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to Deputies O'Keeffe and Moynihan-Cronin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,315. When account is taken of the service of agency nurses, 423 per day, and overtime working, equivalent to 592 nurses per day, the net vacancy situation pertaining at 31 January 2001 <Col N="1185" /> stands at 300. The gross number of vacancies reported for the Eastern Regional Health Authority region, excluding the learning disability sector, was 1,148.79.</P>
    <P>The survey shows that a total of 4,226 nurses were recruited in the year ending 31.01.01 and that a total of 2,954 resigned/retired in the same period. Accordingly, the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,272 nurses in the system. The number of nursing vacancies existing nationally on 30 September 2000 had fallen by 5% by 31 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy situation. A total of 1224 working visas-work authorisations were issued to nurses from non EU countries between June 2000 and April 2001. A number of hospitals in the Dublin area are reporting significant improvements in their position. For example, Beaumont Hospital, which at one stage last year was short 130 nurses, now has a full complement of nursing staff. The Mater Hospital is on target to reduce its vacancies to a low single figure by the end of next month.</P>
    <P>With regard to ensuring an adequate supply of nurses and midwives to staff our health service into the future, the Commission on Nursing identified a need to strengthen the workforce planning functions in my Department. In response, my Department set up a Study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource in December 1998. The aim of the project is to analyse the present position with regard to the nursing and midwifery workforce, to devise a system for the projection of future needs and to plan how these needs may be met. A steering group chaired by my Department's chief nursing officer is overseeing the project.</P>
    <P>The steering group published an interim report in September 2000 and the £5 million recruitment-retention initiative announced by me on 29 November last was my immediate response to recommendations contained in the report. This followed the introduction in February 2001 of permanent part time and flexi time arrangements which should attract more nurses back into the system. The steering group has identified as an urgent priority the refinement of systems and processes used to supply essential information to ensure that forecasts for future nursing and midwifery requirement are feasible and improve over time. Highlighted in the interim report are the inadequacies of existing databases to yield reliable information on which to base forecasts. To address this, work is progressing on the development of a new personnel, payroll, attendance recruitment system, PPARS, that will capture essential data on each individual and post within the health service. The PPARS project is a fundamental building block in developing dependable, reliable and robust quality information to forecast human resource requirements for the health service in the future.</P>
    <P>Increasing the annual intakes of nursing students is a central component of my overall <Col N="1186" /> strategy for addressing the nursing shortage in the medium to long-term. In 2000 there was a 25% increase in the number of nurse training places, from 1,200 to 1,500. The interim report of the steering group recommended that the annual intake of nursing students should continue at this level until at least 2003. My Department has accepted this recommendation. In addition, with a view to increasing the number of general nursing training places in Dublin, funding has been provided to St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, to commence the pre-registration nursing diploma programme in autumn 2001 with an annual intake of 40 students. A total of 1,540 training places are thus available this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Services at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin are provided under arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am aware of concerns over the waiting times experienced by children awaiting treatment for congenital heart defects. The Eastern Regional Health Authority in its dealings with Our Lady's Hospital has prioritised the development of cardiac services. In this regard, additional funding of £1 million was made available during 2000 under the cardiac waiting list programme to allow for an increase in activity at Our Lady's Hospital and for the referral of children to established centres in the USA and the UK.</P>
      <P>The number of patients on the cardiac waiting list at Our Lady's Hospital dropped from 88 on 31 December 1999 to 27 on 31 March 2001. This reduction reflects the progress which has been made arising from the targeting of substantial additional resources to this area. This has also facilitated the appointment of an additional consultant in cardiac surgery who took up duties at the hospital in August 2000. In addition approval was given to the recruitment of two additional anaesthetists and support staff.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that significant additional resources are being targeted at the further development of cardiac services in Our Lady's Hospital under the Provider Plan Agreement between the hospital and the authority for the current year. The plan, which is being finalised, will allow for the recruitment of 57 additional ICU, theatre and ward nurses. Proposals for the appointment of two additional cardiologists are also being considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has already sanctioned a major theatre development at the hospital. This <Col N="1187" /> development, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area incorporating two day theatre suites and a central sterile supplies department. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. The necessary planning for this work is now at an advanced stage. The next step will be to seek tenders for the work with commencement of construction to follow shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I recently announced the provision of a capital grant of £3 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the provision and replacement of urgent priority equipment and minor capital works at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. I am satisfied that the range of measures described above will facilitate the enhancement of services for children with congenital heart defects and other conditions at Our Lady's Hospital.</P>

      <P>As I indicated following the meeting of the Government on Monday, 14 May last, the purpose of the meeting in the Ballymascanlon Hotel was to present to the Government an overview of the health services with regard to progress being made and critical areas which will need further development in the future such as services for older persons, acute hospitals etc.</P>
      <P>The key themes described in the presentation to Government were: a general overview of the system including the achievements over the past four years and the service requirements in the next seven years; human resource issues including workforce planning issues, staff retention, regulation of professions, and partnership working; an overview of current and alternative funding strategies including a central taxation funded system, social insurance fund, and private health insurance; an analysis of current delivery systems including the current organisational structure and the principles governing a review of the current structure; an overview of the health status of the population; and finally, an analysis of overall health spending and comparisons with other EU Countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying demographics and service pressures were set out in these presentations and it is clear that there are significant resource implications arising from the expected demographic changes. In addition, the presentation described our comparative health status with fellow EU member states where it is clear that our rates <Col N="1188" /> compare most unfavourably with other EU countries across many key indicators.</P>
    <P>The question asked for the &ldquo;precise amount in terms of extra expenditure involved&rdquo;, however this will not become clear until further work is done, for example, with the health boards on more defined needs at local level.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the health system must demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness as an integral aspect of the new strategy and to that end the Deloitte and Touche report on VFM in the health services will, I believe, be of crucial importance when completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>Evidence has shown that deep vein thrombosis, DVT, may occur during a long-haul flight. It is associated with prolonged periods of cramped mobility and is more inclined to occur in elderly or obese people, or in women taking oral contraceptive pills. Nevertheless, it may also occur in young and apparently healthy individuals.</P>
      <P>The condition is unlikely to occur on flights into and out of Ireland as the vast majority are of less than five hours duration. However, more and more Irish people are undertaking long haul flights and on these flights the effects of prolonged immobilisation, dehydration and different atmospheric pressure can all contribute to cause DVT.</P>
      <P>While I am aware of the recent reports concerning this condition, I have no immediate plans to initiate an awareness campaign. However, Aer Lingus has made recommendations for passengers in its in-flight magazine, with suggestions for in-flight leg exercises and a good fluid intake to combat dehydration. I welcome initiatives such as this and will keep the matter under review to determine if any action is required.</P>

      <Col N="1192" /> The meningococcal C immunisation programme commenced in October 2000 with the objective of immunising the population up to 22 years of age. Phase 1 of the programme targeted those at greatest risk, that is, children under five years and young persons aged 15-18 years. This phase of the campaign is now almost complete. The success of the programme is reflected in data provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre which indicates a significant reduction in group C meningococcal disease notifications over the past seven months since the launch of the campaign. In the period October 2000 to April 2001, 26 cases of group C meningitis were reported in children aged under 5 years and young persons aged 15-18 years, the target groups for phase 1 of the campaign, compared with 61 cases in these groups over the same period in the previous year. This represents a 57% reduction which is very significant and highlights the importance and success of the campaign to date. The marked reduction in group C is attributable to the vaccine and it is gratifying to see a reduction in cases at this early stage of the campaign. Phase 2 of the programme commenced in March and is targeting primary school children as a priority.</P>
    <P>Primary immunisation uptake still falls short of the target. Special efforts are being made in the current year by the health boards to achieve the national target of 95% which is required to provide immunity to the population at large. Additional funding was provided in 2001 to the health boards to develop strategies to address the uptake problems on a national basis. The following issues need to be addressed in order to meet the target uptake rate: analysis of reasons for low uptake; validation of immunisation databases; ensuring that appropriate regional and local management arrangements are in place; devising strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches where considered necessary; improving immunisation uptake among Travellers; and follow-up of unimmunised children.</P>
    <P>With regard to MMR immunisation, the health boards intensified their MMR immunisation programmes following the measles outbreak, over 1,500 cases, which occurred in 2000. Among the efforts made in this regard were: the identification and follow-up of unimmunised children; the targeting of &ldquo;black spots&rdquo; and vulnerable groups; requesting general practitioners to make special efforts to promote this vaccine to parents; contacting parents, schools and pre-schools to emphasise the importance of this vaccination; national and local media awareness campaigns on MMR vaccination.</P>
    <P>There is some public concern about vaccine safety and this is felt to be a significant factor in the unsatisfactory uptake. All of the expert advice available to my Department indicates that the vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme and indeed vaccines generally used in this country, are safe and effective. My Department will continue to monitor the situation in <Col N="1193" /> relation to these issues at both national and international level.</P>
    <P>In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a National Immunisation Steering Committee, which is addressing a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes which include the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets.</P>
    <P>The policy in relation to childhood immunisations, which is in the interest of children and the community generally, is that they should be offered on a voluntary basis. Parents should discuss with their general practitioner any concerns they may have before making a decision about their child's immunisation. I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to immunise their children. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The placement and care of children under the Child Care Act, 1991 is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. I have been informed by all the health boards that there are no children held in units run by private security companies at present and that it is not the policy of health boards to use private security staff for the purpose of providing care for young people.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question refers to Community Children's Centre Limited, which is a private company set up to provide child care services, as distinct from security services, and which operates a number of small units in a number of locations in the eastern region. I understand from the health boards that this company has taken over the work of the child care division of Secureways Limited. While Secureways originally provided security services for the former Eastern Health Board, it subsequently established a separate child care division and recruited child care staff specifically for this service. The area health boards have informed me that Garda clearance and references are obtained before staff are employed by Community Children's Centre Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area health boards in the eastern region have also informed me that currently they have 18 children with Community Children's Centre and that these arrangements are closely monitored by individual social workers. Meetings take place on a regular basis between senior health board staff and management of Community Children's Centre in relation to these services. This service is availed of as an interim measure as the boards are currently developing a wide range of <Col N="1194" /> new and alternative services for children and young people in the region. None of the other health boards outside the eastern region have children placed with Community Children's Centre.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, residential homes operated by the health boards are subject to inspection by the Social Services Inspectorate, whilst children's residential centres not operated by health boards are subject to inspection by health boards. The Social Services Inspectorate provides training for, and holds regular meetings with, health board inspectors to ensure that the standard of inspection of voluntary children's residential centres is in line with that of the Social Services Inspectorate.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the area health boards in the eastern region that the homes run by the predecessor of the Community Children's Centre were visited by the former Eastern Health Board's Inspectorate shortly after that Inspectorate was established. Visits were made simultaneously to all other non-statutory services providing residential care in the eastern region. Each service was given advice and guidance as well as information on the template for inspections. In addition all services were facilitated simultaneously at a one day seminar-workshop. The Regional Registration and Inspection Service for the eastern region inspected one of the Community Children's Centre facilities in March this year and the other centres will be inspected as part of the inspection services work programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the formal inspection and registration process, started in March and which is ongoing, the directors of child care and-or their individual social work staff regularly visit the centres and the young people to review the accommodation, to discuss current provisions and future developments and to review the adequacy or numbers of staff and their training needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>While a licensing system for all food services and catering facilities does not exist in Ireland there is an effective system of registration of such premises.</P>
      <P>The Food Hygiene Regulations 1950-89, which were enacted under the Health Act 1947, and which set out statutory requirements in relation to food hygiene and food premises, currently provide for the registration of the following seven classes of food premises: hotels, and holiday camps; restaurants; butchers and pork butchers; wholesalers; poulterers and fishmongers; manufacturers; takeaways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Registration of these classes of food premises is contingent on the premises meeting the hygiene <Col N="1195" /> standards set out in the regulations. The regulations also allow for the annual licensing of certain types of food stalls, and a permit system for premises used on an occasional basis for the operation of a food business.</P>
    <P>The regulations are enforced by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, a statutory, independent and science-based body, overseeing all functions relating to the food safety regulation of the food industry. The FSAI took over responsibility for the enforcement of all food safety legislation in July 1999. This responsibility is discharged by means of service contracts with the agencies, which prior to the establishment of the FSAI were responsible for food control. Each service contract includes details on the work that the official agency undertakes on behalf of the FSAI, to ensure compliance with and the enforcement of food safety legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> As the Food Hygiene Regulations 1950-1989 have been superseded to a significant degree by European legislation, my Department is currently revising these regulations. In this regard the question of the introduction of a licencing system for food premises will be considered.</P>

      <P>Female genital mutilation is a harmful traditional practice which constitutes an assault which causes serious harm to girls and women on whom it is carried out. Such an act is an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997. It would, therefore, be a matter for the Garda Síochána to prosecute any person who performed FGM in Ireland. However I am considering whether it may be appropriate to enact legislation specifically prohibiting this practice.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently written to the chief executive officers of the health boards, drawing their attention to this issue and requesting that personnel working with immigrant populations take opportunities to educate them about the dangers and unacceptability of female genital mutilation. My Department has also written to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform asking it to arrange through the Directorate for Asylum Support Services that asylum seekers are made aware of the situation.</P>

      <P>For some time now, there has been disagreement between the three children's hospitals in Dublin concerning the location of certain specialties and the structure of consultant paediatric surgery posts. The failure of the three hospitals to agree on the structuring of a specialist paediatric surgery post, as recommended by Comhairle na nOspidéal in its report &ldquo;Review of Paediatric Surgery Services&rdquo;, has prevented the post being filled in a permanent capacity.</P>

      <P>Cannabis is a schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. It is also one of the controlled drugs which has been designated for the purposes of section 13 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>The nature of the controls provided in this manner are those which, according to the current UN Conventions on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, must be applied to substances, such as cannabis and cannabis resin, for which there is no current recognised medical or scientific use. Under these laws, the manufacture, possession, supply, and prescription of the drug are prohibited, except under licence from the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By virtue of the designation under section 13 of the Act, licences may be only granted for the purpose of research, forensic analysis, or in respect of the use of the drug as an essential intermediate or starting material in an industrial manufacturing process. Licences may also be granted in the case of certain low tetrahydrocan<Col N="1199" /> nabinol plant varieties of cannabis for the growing of hemp. Furthermore, the Minister must be satisfied in regard to the scientific or medical justification offered in support of the grant of any licence involving any of the designated controlled drugs such as cannabis.</P>
    <P>I am aware that claims are being made in respect of cannabis about the possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma. However, these medical claims are not currently supported by the results of recognised medical research.</P>
    <P>If, however, an application were to be made to me for a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and the Orders and Regulations made thereunder, which proposed the conduct of research into the therapeutic use of cannabis, in circumstances where the approval of the Irish Medicines Board under the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 were to be forthcoming and which would be likely to obtain the necessary approval of the appropriate Ethics Committee under that Act, I would be prepared to give serious consideration to the grant of the required licence(s) under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has overall responsibility to ensure that a co-ordinated, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse is in place.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned the objectives of the health response to the drug problem are based on two key elements, reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which is a return to a drug free lifestyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, runs, or is involved in a number of initiatives aimed at tackling and reducing the number of young people misusing substances nationwide and most particularly within the eastern region, where the majority of problem drug misusers reside. These initiatives include supporting drug education and prevention programmes and social and personal health education, SPHE, a broad based lifeskills programme for junior certificate students, in schools. A support service to implement this programme has been established through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with health boards, Marino Institute and the National Council for Curriculum and <Col N="1200" /> Assessment. The substance abuse prevention programme &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; will be incorporated into the SPHE programme in the future and the &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; programme will continue to be implemented in primary schools. Teachers and schools are also often supported by regional health education officers from the health boards.</P>
    <P>Within the youth sector the National Youth Health Programme has been developed through a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland. This programme provides training and support for a range of initiatives aimed at the youth sector nationwide. The programmes supported include the &ldquo;Youth Work Support Pack for Dealing with the Drugs Issue&rdquo;, &ldquo;Knowledge is Power&rdquo; and &ldquo;Drink Awareness for Everyone&rdquo;. A range of other training and support is offered to youth groups and youth work leaders to assist them to deal with the issue of drugs, alcohol and smoking as they arise in their work. Also within the youth sector a substantial number of drugs education workers have been appointed and supported.</P>
    <P>Within the community setting &ldquo;Drugs Questions, Local Answers&rdquo; is a community based programme offered by health boards which aims to activate local communities to assess the drug problem specific to their own area and then to look at ways in which the community can respond to the issues arising. The programme was developed by the health promotion unit of my Department and is delivered regionally by local people who have been trained in delivering the programme. &ldquo;Being Well&rdquo; is another community based programme which has been developed by the health promotion unit. This programme encourages people to take a holistic approach to their health but also looks specifically at smoking and alcohol. This programme is supported by regional health boards and delivered by local people, who have been appropriately trained.</P>
    <P>The health boards also support a range of parenting interventions such as Family, Communication and Self Esteem, a parenting programme which aims to look at ways in which parents can pro-actively deal with the issue of drugs within the home. Health boards also fund a number of voluntary organisations whose work involves prevention and treatment of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>Services for drug users in all health boards have increased substantially over the last number of years. Funding has been provided to the regional health boards to considerably strengthen the infrastructure for the delivery of drugs services. In the eastern region, treatment services have expanded from three locations in 1995 to the current 55. The number of people receiving treatment has risen from 1,358 in 1995 to more than 5,000 now. In an independent review of the drug services of the Eastern Health Board published in 2000 the authors found that &ldquo;There has been a remarkable degree of activity and expansion within the services in the EHB over the past four to five years  . . . a programme of service expan<Col N="1201" /> sion was embarked on that is probably one of the more innovative community drug service programmes in Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Despite the progress achieved to date there are waiting lists for drug treatment. The Eastern Regional Health Authority have received additional funding in 2001 to address this situation. The authority, in conjunction with the area health boards will work towards tackling this problem with the overall aim of eliminating these waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also know that the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Ryan, recently launched the National Drugs Strategy which sets out a series of specific objectives and actions for dealing with this serious problem over the next seven years. The National Drugs Strategy recommends 100 actions. My Department will have a major responsibility in implementing a number of these and it will immediately set up a special working group, chaired by the deputy Secretary General, to drive their implementation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these actions, many of which involve a multi-sectoral approach, will have a positive impact on the situation.</P>

      <P>The present system of manuscript registers of birth, deaths and marriages, which provides the basis for the civil registration system, was established in the mid 19th century. This system is restrictive when compared to a modern computer assisted system. A registrar only register events which occur within his or her district and can only issue certificates when he or she has possession of the particular register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the General Register Office are working on a major programme to modernise the Civil Registration Ser<Col N="1202" /> vice. Funding of £7.3 million was approved by Government in 1999 for a programme which includes the reform of legislation, the design and development of new processes and procedures and the introduction of new technology. It is proposed to implement these changes in 2002. The new registration service will make full use of modern technology to register life events. The new system will improve access to registration data and provide for electronic sharing of data with Government offices and Departments who have a need for such information, thereby improving efficiency and reducing the need for applicants for services to provide certificates with each application. The new system will also improve customer services and provide local access to certified copies of registration records.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the associated modernisation project through which the archival records of the General Register office and the associated indexes are being electronically scanned in Roscommon. This work involves the filming and scanning of 21 million register entries to provide a database of images of the pages and the direct scanning and conversion of the printed indexes, to provide a machine readable index. The process is strictly controlled to ensure accuracy and completeness.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Irish Medicines Board, which is the national competent authority on the regulation of medicinal products, that an application for authorization was received for this medicinal product in June 2000 under the European mutual recognition licensing procedure. The proposed indication was: &ldquo;Emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse or failure of a contraceptive method&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the mechanisms of action of this product is <i>via</i> the inhibition of implantation of a ferti<Col N="1204" /> lised egg. This mode of action is interpreted by some as abortifacient. No products with this mode of action or with this indication have ever been licensed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board's understanding at the time was, and remains, that under the Constitution, and law, it would not be legally permissable for it to authorize the product for that type of indication. It decided to consult its legal advisers to seek counsel opinion on the board's behalf. As there are strict timelines to the European mutual recognition licensing procedure, the Irish Medicines Board informed the company of its understanding of the legal position in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The company had the option of amending the requested indication, challenging the position as set out by the board, withdrawing the application from Ireland. It voluntarily withdrew the application on July 27 2000.</P>
    <P>I understand that counsel opinion is expected to be available to the Irish Medicines Board in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my predecessor published the White Paper on Private Health Insurance in September 1999 and in that document the position relating to the future corporate status of the VHI was outlined. The Government will implement legislation to give full commercial freedom to VHI and to secure, in the interests of its members and staff, a corporate status commensurate with the needs of the competitive environment in which it operates, and which will provide it with the optimum operational and strategic flexibility. This legislation will establish the VHI as a public limited company under the Companies Acts and will make it subject to the obligations and responsibilities that apply under company law. The shareholding in the new company will be held by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the legislation to effect change in the VHI's corporate status will allow for third party investment, and include provision for the eventual full sale of the State's interest in VHI, if deemed desirable at any stage following its enactment.</P>

      <P>Successive Governments have consistently affirmed their commitment to the availability of a mix of public and private care within the Irish health system. Under the hospital consultants contract, consultants are entitled to engage in private practice within public hospitals. In relation to private practice in a public hospital, a consultant's overall proportion of private to public patients should reflect the ratio of public to private stay beds as designated under health legislation which requires that all public hospital beds be classified as public, private or non-designated. Hospital equipment is used to treat both public and private patients. Normally when private patients are treated in public hospitals, a fee is charged by the consultant or consultants for professional services and by the hospital for maintenance.</P>
      <P>The mix of public and private health care is being addressed within the context of the new health strategy currently under development and due for completion by mid-year. A specific strategy sub-group is examining the issues concerned including the use of hospital facilities. This work is being carried out having regard to the identified need to increase bed capacity for public patients in the hospital system.</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that the provision of hospital services at Waterford Regional Hospital is the statutory responsibility of the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation of cancer treatment and care services was outlined in the national cancer strategy, an evidence based initiative aimed at the development of high quality cancer services throughout the country. Structures were put in place to take a lead role and to co-ordinate the <Col N="1207" /> implementation of the national cancer strategy. Mr. Gordon Watson, Waterford Regional Hospital was appointed as regional director for cancer services in the South-Eastern Health Board area for a three year period and he was re-appointed to the post again last year. Mr. Watson also represents the regional directors on the expert working group on radiotherapy services which I established last year to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services nationally.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that since the commencement of the implementation of the cancer strategy, significant developments and improvements have taken place in cancer treatment and care services in the South-Eastern Health Board area. Five new medical consultant posts have been approved in the areas of medical oncology &ndash; two posts &ndash; palliative care, histopathology and haematology. In addition, two specialist consultant surgery posts in the area of breast surgery have been approved, with a third general surgery post approved to facilitate this work. A replacement post of gastrointestinal surgery has also been approved for the South-Eastern Health Board Area.</P>

      <P>A number of initiatives has been taken in relation to the improvement of dementia services. Significant additional funding of £4 million has been made available in the period 1999-2001 for the express purpose of providing assistance to carers, including carers of Alzheimer's sufferers. Additional funding of £1.7 million has been made available to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland for expansion of their services, particularly day care. A number of new community nursing units for older people, which have been constructed in recent years, provide respite and day care for people with dementia. Further such units will be put in place during the lifetime of the national development plan. In addition, purpose-built units for the care of older people who are mentally infirm will be constructed in a number of locations such as Galway, Newcastlewest and Carndonagh, under the <Col N="1208" /> national development plan. Resources have also been provided to expand the provision of specialist services in psychiatry of old age. It is planned that by the end of 2001 some 14 consultant-led services will be in place.</P>
      <P>I accept the need to further develop services for people with dementia and their carers particularly in relation to meeting the preferences of older people to be supported in their own homes. It is my intention to continue with initiatives commenced in recent years of allocating additional developmental resources towards the build-up of community supports for older people, including those with dementia.</P>

      <P>The issue of alcohol advertising is a complex one and one which I am currently examining. A number of actions have been taken which are relevant to this issue.</P>
      <P>Research into the impact of alcohol advertising on young people has been commissioned by the health promotion unit of my Department. The results of this research will be available shortly and will inform future action in this area.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland to include some new recommendations in their updated advertising code. These include: that the content of advertising should not create the impression that alcohol drinking contributes to social and sexual success; that the placement of alcohol advertising should not be permitted in the media where more than 25% of the audience is underage; that those who promote or advertise alcohol on line should provide mechanisms for parents to prevent their children's access to that advertising; and that advertisers of alcohol should avoid content that is attractive to underage customers and they should post educational messages about responsible drinking.</P>

      <Quest> the initiatives which have been taken by her Department to secure the adoption of the code of conduct for disputes in essential services in each of the key spheres of essential services, such as health, transport, power, education, waste services and telecommunications; and her plans to deliver the code in the future. </Quest>
      <QRef>[14612/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for dealing with industrial relations issues and the resolution of disputes rests with employers, employees and their representatives. The State's industrial relations machinery is there to promote good industrial relations and assist parties in the resolution of disputes.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains an industrial peace clause, similar to those contained in earlier national agreements. Despite this, regrettably we have recently experienced disputes, including disputes involving essential services, where industrial action has occurred which is in breach of the industrial peace clause.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the provision of essential services, the Labour Relations Commission has drawn up a code of practice on dispute procedures including procedures in essential services. This code was drawn up by the commission following consultations with the social partners and promulgated by the Minister in 1992 by means of a statutory instrument, the Code of Practice on Dispute Procedures (Declaration) Order, 1992 (S.I. No. 1 of 1992).</P>
      <P>The code aims to ensure that disputes are resolved without recourse to industrial action by providing practical guidance on procedures for the resolution of such disputes and places particular emphasis on the avoidance of disputes in essential services. It also sets out additional procedures and safeguards for inclusion in agreements between employers and trade unions in such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The level of adoption of the code of practice has been disappointing. In order to promote implementation of the code, the high level group on trade union recognition, established under Partnership 2000, recommended that parties involved in providing essential services agree amendments to their disputes procedures to adapt the key provisions of the code and that they do so before the expiry of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment from the parties to agree voluntary codes of practice to address in particular the maintenance of essential services. In the talks on an adjustment to the terms of the programme last December, both ICTU and IBEC undertook to actively pursue adherence by their respective members to the key terms of the pay agreement, which would include the agreement of voluntary codes of practice to address the maintenance of essential services.</P>
    <P>In order to establish the extent to which the code of practice had been implemented in the relevant enterprises, the Labour Relations Commission commissioned a study during 2000. The findings of the report were not encouraging, in particular in relation to the implementation of section V.33 of the code which recommends that companies who provide essential services or supplies should have voluntary agreements negotiated between management, employees and trade unions where all parties agree to accept the awards, decision or recommendation of a third party without resorting to any form of industrial action.</P>
    <P>Irish industrial relations policy is one of voluntarism and primary responsibility for the adoption of this code remains with the relevant employers and employees and their representatives. The parties will be aware that the Labour Relations Commission is available to assist them should they wish to avail of its services in agreeing arrangements under the code.</P>
    <P>I urge all concerned to take practical steps to pursue the objective of the code. The code is, after all, designed to help employers and trade unions to reach agreements which respect the positions of the parties concerned.

      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is currently investigating the circumstances of the closure of this company within the terms of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 and whether appropriate criminal proceedings should be considered by me.</P>
      <P>Where it is alleged that an employer has contravened sections 9 and/or 10 of the 1977 Act, as amended by the European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; in relation to information and consultation of employees &ndash; the employees or a trade union, staff association or an excepted body, may present a complaint to a rights commissioner on behalf of the employees. The rights commissioner is empowered to investigate the complaint and to issue a decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>As the company concerned is not in liquidation, receivership or subject to any of the proceedings or actions which define insolvency for the purpose of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991, that scheme does not apply.</P>
      <P>However, it is also open to individual employees to pursue entitlements under the terms of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991 and the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The Payment of Wages Act, 1991 provides a right of complaint to a rights commissioner for any employee who has had an unlawful deduction made from wages and this includes non-payment of wages. A complaint must be presented to a rights commissioner within six months of the non-payment, which gave rise to the complaint.</P>
      <P>Under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, section 19, an employee is entitled to annual leave calculated as follows: four working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment, or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works 117 hours, or 8% of the hours he or she works in a leave year but subject to a maximum of four working weeks.</P>
      <P>If an employer refuses to grant an employee his or her annual leave entitlement the employee may refer a complaint to a rights commissioner for redress.</P>

      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993, administered by my Department protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their employment and provide redress for employees found to be unfairly dismissed. This includes situations where conditions of work are proven to be so difficult that an employee is justified in terminating contract of employment. Such a termination must, be justified by the employee concerned. This situation is described as constructive dismissal.</P>
      <P>In general, to qualify under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and have at least one year's continuous service. If the individual concerned feels she may have been unfairly dismissed, she may refer the matter to a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal for investigation under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.</P>
      <P>An explanatory booklet on the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993 or clarification on any matter contained therein may be obtained on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie or by contacting the employment rights information unit of my Department at (01) 631 3131 or on Lo-call 1890 220222.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific legislation in my Department dealing with workplace bullying, there are a number of existing legislative provisions covering employment equality, safety, health and welfare in the workplace and industrial relations which have a bearing on the issue.</P>
      <P>A person who feels he or she has been bullied should, in the first instance, seek advice from the Health and Safety Authority &ndash; HSA &ndash;  as to the most appropriate course of action to be taken. The HSA may be contacted at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2, telephone 01-614700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the issue of workplace bullying is the subject of a task force report, which I recently launched. The report, which represents a comprehensive examination of the issue, has made a number of recommend<Col N="1215" /> ations relating to actions which should be undertaken at both State and at enterprise level, in order to address workplace bullying.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendations relating to action at State level include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the introduction of codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the codes of practice will be to provide guidance on putting in place policies and procedures at the level of individual enterprises, and as a basis and a reference point for the relevant State agencies, that is the Health and Safety Authority, the Equality Authority and the Labour Relations Commission, charged with offering advice and assistance.</P>

      <P>The current position is that all individuals outside the European Economic Area, EEA, require work permits to work in Ireland assuming they cannot avail of the work authorisation or working visa scheme, regardless of whether or not their spouse has a work permit. The issue of a work permit to an individual does not confer any entitlement to that person's spouse.</P>
      <P>The rationale of the work permit system, as in other countries, is to allow employers to fill positions, on a temporary basis, with a non-EEA national where the employer has been unable to fill these positions either by an Irish or other EEA national. The scheme is employer driven on the basis of labour and skills needs.</P>
      <P>Employers are required to make all reasonable efforts to recruit from within the EEA and evidence of such efforts must be provided with the application for a work permit.</P>

      <P>Representations were made to my Department advising of non-payment to the employee concerned of the tribunal award. My Department followed up on these representations requesting payment to the employee of the amount due by the employer. The employee concerned subsequently advised my Department that payment of the award had not been received.</P>
      <P>A file in the matter has now been prepared and passed to my legal advisors, i.e. to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal advice as to the enforceability of the determination and, if so enforceable, for their consideration as to the appropriate legal steps to take to enforce the award. As such steps may ultimately entail prosecution of the individual's former employer in the courts, it has been necessary, as part of the general preparatory work for a possible hearing, to carry out a check as to the precise legal identity of that employer with a view to ensuring legal enforceability of the tribunal determination.</P>

      <P>The provision of incentives for the establishment of industry is a statutory function of the industrial development agencies, and not one in which I as Minister would have a direct function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a wide range of such incentives for the BMW region, and tailored to the requirements of client companies, are operated by the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department. Details of incentives such as capital, employment, research and development and training grants, as specified in the national development plan, are available from the appropriate agencies: IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. Under EU guidelines, the industrial development agencies are permitted higher limits in relation to the levels of incentives offered to the BMW Region &ndash; Objective 1 &ndash; as compared with the rest of the country <Col N="1217" />&ndash; Objective 1 in Transition. The agencies have also established new regional structures to implement their strategies designed to achieve more balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months, IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into Objective One regions in the coming years. This target was achieved during 2000. In the Objective One regions IDA has acquired a number of additional sites and also upgraded many of its sites to business park standard. Furthermore, it has arranged in partnership with private developers, to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key locations.</P>
    <P>The core mission of Enterprise Ireland is to work in partnership with client companies to develop a sustainable competitive advantage leading to a significant increase in profitable sales, exports and employment. Enterprise Ireland's Strategy &ndash; 1999-2001 &ndash; sets out a range of targets to be achieved over the period and also articulates a strong regional focus for driving regional economic development. More recently, Enterprise Ireland has developed a regional strategy, Driving Growth in Regional Enterprise, for the achievement of balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development, which is the regional development company for the Shannon Region and which includes Clare and south west Offaly in the BMW region, will concentrate on key projects which are capable of significant economic impact for the benefit of the region. The company has also set itself the objective of achieving a more balanced spread of development throughout the Shannon Region. The incentives offered by Shannon Development in the BMW region are essentially the same as those offered by Enterprise Ireland. In addition, the 13 county enterprise boards which deal with micro-enterprises in the BMW region are empowered to offer assistance at various levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current fiscal terms for exploration and exploitation of petroleum offshore Ireland are governed by the provisions pertaining to petroleum contained in the Finance Act, 1992. Under this Act, corporation tax at a rate of 25% will apply to profits from gas production under the petroleum lease for the Corrib Field. The corporation tax will be payable after the deduction of allowances. These allowances relate to capital and operating expenditure and abandonment costs for the field. In addition, exploration costs are also deductible, which need not necessarily be <Col N="1218" /> field related, provided they have been incurred in the 25 year period immediately prior to the commencement of field production. The corporation tax accruing will depend on a number of factors including those referred to above and the amount and price of the gas sold.</P>
      <P>The benefits to the people of north Mayo will include the opportunities for employment during the construction phase of the development and permanent employment at the terminal when it becomes operational. It is understood that up to 500 persons will be employed during the construction phase and up to 50-60 persons at the terminal when it becomes operational. Enterprise Energy Ireland anticipate that Irish contractors and suppliers will feature prominently in the terminal construction team. It is anticipated that the development will also provide more localised benefits for the duration of the construction period. These include increased trade in local shops and service industries and accommodation providers as well as indirect employment.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary pipeline infrastructure is in place to bring gas to customers, both domestic and commercial, in the west. I understand that Bord Gáis are at present considering the feasibility of making gas available to towns in the west and north of the country. The existence of this infrastructure should make the western region more attractive to inward investment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been convicted of a number of criminal offences in the United States. In 1996 she was sentenced to one to three years imprisonment for theft but was released on probation; in 1998, in violation of her probation, she used a credit card fraudulently, an offence to which she pleaded guilty and for which she was sentenced to serve the prison term imposed in 1996. This crime in US law constitutes an &ldquo;aggravated felony&rdquo; warranting deportation from the country; accordingly, she was released on parole and deported to Ireland in July 1999. However, she returned illegally to the United States two months later in violation of parole terms, was re-arrested in February 2000 and until 29 June 2001 is serving the remainder of the original sentence for theft. The case concerning illegally entering the United States and violating parole terms, federal offences to which she is pleading guilty, is scheduled to be heard in court on 18 June 2001.</P>
      <P>The four children and a grand-daughter of this person reside in the United States.</P>
      <P>The Irish Consulate-General in Boston has been in contact with the lawyer representing this woman and with the US authorities familiar with the case and an officer of the Consulate General will shortly visit her. I am satisfied there are no grounds on which my intervention in the judicial process could be justified. The Consulate-General will continue to monitor developments closely to see that this person is treated fairly and will give her every appropriate assistance.</P>

      <Quest>the position taken by the Government at the UN Security Council meeting considering the report of the UN panel of experts that the Presidents of Uganda and Rwanda are plundering and looting gold, diamonds and other precious minerals and resources from war torn Congo and using development assistance in helping their war efforts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The United Nations Security Council held an open meeting on 3 May to consider the report of the panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC and the link between the exploitation of resources and the continuation of the war. Representatives of the Governments of the DRC, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi were present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting, the Security Council decided to extend the mandate of the panel of experts by a further three months to enable it to update the report, assess progress made, undertake further analysis and follow up on the activities of countries and actors whose activities had not been addressed in depth in the report.</P>
      <P>In our national statement, the Government supported the extension of the panel's mandate and expressed the hope that it would provide a fuller picture of the complexity and extent to which the exploitation of resources in the DRC contributes to sustaining the conflict in the region.</P>
      <P>Ireland noted the serious nature of the allegations against the parties to the conflict and made clear the Government's expectation that the relevant national authorities should thoroughly investigate the allegations and co-operate with the panel of experts in its future work. We welcomed Uganda's decision to establish an independent judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the allegations against it, and also welcomed Burundi's decision to investigate the allegations and to continue to co-operate with the panel. At the same time, we noted that some parties had expressed concerns about the report which needed to be addressed during the panel's extended mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland also stressed the need to view the panel of experts report as part of the wider efforts of the international community to end the DRC conflict. In the coming months, we would be expecting progress by the parties on the implementation of the three core aspects of the Lusaka Agreement: withdrawal of all foreign troops from the DRC, the disarmament of armed groups, and <Col N="1223" /> the holding of the national dialogue to provide for a new political dispensation in the DRC.</P>
    <P>Following the Security Council meeting, the Minister of State at my Department, Ms Liz O'Donnell met with Prime Minister Nsibambi of Uganda on 14 May and stressed the importance attached by the Government to Uganda's response to the allegations contained in the panel of experts report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 to 141, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited was incorporated in 1979 under the Companies Acts. It is owned by the State by virtue of the fact that the shares in the company are held in the name of the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The proposed transaction between the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, and Tosco Corporation involves the disposal of the INPC's business and certain of its assets, chiefly the Whitegate Refinery and the Whiddy Oil Terminal, for a consideration of US$100 million. This valuation represents the commercial judgment of the proposed purchaser as to the value of the overall package which it proposes to acquire, and is the best deal available after an extensive search process.</P>
      <P>The State is retaining responsibility for the existing debts of the INPC. In addition, the purchaser has sought a ministerial guarantee which would have the effect of the State being liable for any of the INPC's liabilities under the legal agreement should the INPC be unable to discharge them. This guarantee could cover certain potential environmental liabilities. The details of the latter have been the subject of substantial negotiations between the parties and I am satisfied that it would be against our commercial interest to disclose them at this time.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the shareholder interest was adequately reflected in the process and in the negotiations, my Department, the Department of Finance and the external consultants Arthur Andersen and Matheson Ormsby Prentice have been actively and directly involved for several months. The chairman of the INPC and an assistant secretary from my Department have been leading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have been advised by the Attorney General that in order to complete the transaction, legislation will be necessary to provide for the guarantee referred <Col N="1225" /> to and other functions that I might exercise in relation to the sale. As matters stand, no undertakings have been entered into by any party to the proposed transaction. Prior to the enactment of the legislation, it would be possible for me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to authorise the INPC to sign legal documentation relating to the proposed transaction, should the Government deem this appropriate. No such authorisation has issued to date.</P>
    <P>I would like to again assure the House that no binding commitments will be made by the State in relation to the proposed transaction unless and until I am satisfied that shareholder concerns have been fully addressed and the required legislation has been enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services including broadband services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services traditionally has been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, 26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion. A number of these projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the north-west. Esat Telecom were supported in the roll-out of fibre optic cable in urban areas including Sligo and Letterkenny. Esat also extended their backbone network to Castlerea, Ballyhaunis, Sligo and Collooney. Eircom were allocated funding for the installation of a 95 km high capacity fibre optic <Col N="1226" /> cable along the west coast of Donegal, from Bunbeg to Donegal town and from Dunfanaghy to Falcarragh serving all communities along the route.</P>
    <P>The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to 200 million. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received I signed nine contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of 160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately 55 million.</P>
    <P>Among these projects the north-west will benefit from the building of the ESB fibre-optic network through Sligo and Donegal, the presence of Nevadatele's communications centres in Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo and the construction of a broadband communications corridor by Chorus from Mayo through Sligo and into Donegal. Additional details of these projects are available at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie.</P>

All members of the Reserve are required to sign for receipt of clothing and kit etc. The system has been changed from a manual recording to a computerised system over the course of the last four years. I am advised that certain technical administrative difficulties may attend the issue of requisites to Reserve officers specifically, in that these personnel are not yet individually entered into the computerised personnel management system as individual data records. However, clothing and kit continues to be issued to Reserve officers as required.</P>

      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group, which met each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, reported in September 1999. A thorough, comprehensive and indepth study of the Reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by a military board, established by the then Chief of Staff, and latterly by the steering group itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I formally launched the steering group report in November 2000 at a special briefing for the southern region in Thurles organised by the military authorities for serving members of the Reserve. A similar briefing for the western region took place in Athlone in December 2000. A third <Col N="1228" /> briefing was held in Dublin in December 2000. I am pleased that the various recommendations contained in the steering group report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a board has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the steering group. Under the aegis of this board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with Reserve Defence Force personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. I am further advised by the military authorities that it is anticipated that the board will submit its report to the chief of staff by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force, as envisaged by the steering group, will be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and organisational changes will require about six years to bring to completion. The military authorities will consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of Reserve units within each brigade area and in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, pending completion of the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any aspect of the reorganisation and restructuring of the Reserve, including the artillery regiments.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I announced on 1 March of last year, the allocation of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. The tender competition for the acquisition of the helicopters is pro<Col N="1229" /> gressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    <P>The tender competition is being carried out in two stages, a request for proposals &ndash; RFP &ndash; stage and a request for tenders &ndash; RFT &ndash; stage. The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 19 April 2001. Fours tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Limited from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC Scotia from Scotland.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive evaluation process has begun on the proposed helicopters. The evaluation will, of necessity, take some time to complete. It is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract later this year.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other equipment requirements in the Air Corps. A priority is the requirement to acquire fixed wing training aircraft for Air Corps cadets and officers. When proposals are received from the military authorities in relation to this I will arrange for my Department to progress the matter as one of urgency.</P>

      <P>Following a tender competition which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers, APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses.</P>
      <P>The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
      <P>The first two vehicles were produced at the end of 2000 and following rigorous inspection and acceptance testing procedures were officially handed over to me on 11 January 2001. Both vehicles remained in Switzerland to facilitate training of Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      <P>The full production run has commenced. A total of six vehicles including the two vehicles handed over in January will be arriving in Ireland next month. All 40 APCs will have been delivered by January 2002, almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with the progress made on the APC programme. The purchase of the APCs forms an integral part of the ongoing re-equipment programme. The imminent arrival of the vehicles is a great boost for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 40 cattle under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 31 May 2000.</P>
      <P> Following an examination of his application, it was noted that four of the animals applied on, tag numbers 121301630091, 121301690097, 121301620099 and 121301680105, had been sent to the factory on 12 July 2000. Under the terms and conditions of the 2000 cattle headage scheme animals applied on had to be retained on the farm for two calendar months from the day following receipt of application, or had to be replaced with other acceptable animals.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to the person named on 9 November 2000 advising him of the situation and asked him to forward the tag numbers of replacement animals, if any.</P>
      <P>A reply was received in my Department from the person named on 16 November 2000. He stated that he had three replacement animals. These animals were not accepted as eligible replacements and he was written to on 12 December 2000 and advised that four animals were being rejected and that a reduction penalty would apply to the remaining eligible animals on his application. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. His application for a review was received by my Department on 18 December 2000. He was written to on 14 May 2001 and advised that two of the replacement animals were acceptable, two animals were rejected and that a reduction penalty would apply to the remaining eligible animals. He was given the opportunity to appeal this decision by writing to the Headage and Premia Appeals Unit, Agriculture House, Kildare Street, Dublin 2 within 21 days.</P>

    <P>However, a further check on his application has shown that a fifth animal, tag number SPMM006IT was sent to the factory on 12 July 2000.

      <P>The matter has been examined in detail by the REPS appeals committee, which decided that the penalty was correctly applied and must remain in place. In arriving at this decision, the appeals committee noted that the planning permission cited in the appeal required the removal of 15m of hedgerow on either side of an entrance. My Department's inspectors found, however, that 150m of hedgerow had been removed. Since this went far beyond what was required by the planning conditions, the penalty was upheld.

      <P>Once a suspect animal is confirmed as being BSE positive various <Col N="1233" /> checks are undertaken to seek to establish the cause of the disease. As a matter of routine, the ear tags of the animals concerned are sent to the forensic laboratory of the Garda Síochána for examination, to establish whether there is any evidence that the tag has been interfered with after insertion into the animal's ear. This is an essential part of the Department's BSE controls system and in the vast majority of cases gives no cause for concern in relation to the origin of the animal concerned.</P>
      <P>In exceptional cases, however, the forensic report provides evidence that the tag of the infected animal has been or may have been interfered with after insertion into the animal's ear. Where such evidence is judged by the scientists in the Garda forensic laboratory to be particularly strong, my Department investigates the matter further in an effort to clear up any doubts as to the origins of the animal.</P>
      <P>It is evident that consumer concerns in relation to BSE had led to a crisis in the beef industry in Ireland and across Europe prior to the foot and mouth disease crisis and, more importantly, that BSE has been linked to the invariably fatal degenerative human disease, nv CJD.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances my Department cannot ignore evidence that an ear tag identifying a BSE infected animal has been or may have been interfered with in an illegal manner. Indeed I would regard it as an abrogation of the State's duty to fail to conduct a further investigation where such evidence is available.</P>
      <P>The particular case referred to by the Deputy is being investigated for the usual reasons. The procedures to date have been in accordance with due process. There is no provision in the BSE legislation for the payment of additional compensation for the time taken to carry out a legitimate and necessary investigation.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate to provide any further detail in relation to this case at this stage. However, I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to expedite the matter and I expect that the matter will be drawn to a conclusion in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the early retirement 2000 scheme launched in November last, certain income criteria apply for both the transferor and the transferee. The transferor must derive at least 25% of his or her income from farming, and the total income from farming and <Col N="1234" /> non-farming sources must not exceed 200 income units, except in the case of a definitive transfer to a family member, where there is no upper limit. The transferee must prove his or her viability by having an income of at least 50 income units of which 20 income units are derived from farming. An upper non-farm income limit of 100 income units applies to the transferee. In cash terms, an income unit is £200.</P>
      <P>The definition of non-farm income under the scheme includes FÁS community employment scheme payments as well as a number of social welfare payments. The primary purpose of this is to enable potential transferees who may not be in remunerative employment, or may be engaged in training courses with a view to improving their employment prospects, to achieve the minimum level of income that determines viability. Rather than being discriminatory, therefore, this definition is intended to make the scheme more widely available by increasing the number of potential transferees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The foot and mouth crisis has highlighted the disease control risks that attach to widespread movement of animals. It has also underlined the need for continuous monitoring of animal movements. In that context, the EU Commission, in consultation with the Standing Veterinary Committee, has taken a number of decisions to restrict the movement of animals of species susceptible to foot and mouth.</P>
      <P>The Commission decision of 15 May 2001 contains a number of elements that were not included in the extract supplied. While the decision eases certain restrictions in regard to the movement of species susceptible to foot and mouth disease, it extends the prohibition on the movement of animals through staging posts and maintains for an additional period certain restrictions on the movement of susceptible animals within the Community.</P>
      <P>I have considered the decision carefully and have already taken the measures I feel are appropriate at this juncture to resume trade. Within this country cattle may be bought and sold for slaughter or further production, provided specified precautionary measures and permitting systems relative to FMD are observed. In addition, sheep and pigs may be sold for slaughter. In regard to live exports, the prohibition on the use of staging posts creates difficulties in relation to resumption of trade in cattle to most continental markets. However, I am considering practical and workable mechanisms whereby this trade can be resumed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards transport movements involving large numbers of animals, the reality is that the risk of spread of disease increases according to the volume of animals moved and the circumstances in which such movements take place. While large-scale movements of animals in a single group to a single destination would facilitate easy tracing, they would not reduce the spread of any infection that might be present. Nevertheless, I have asked the marts to propose protocols for consideration by the expert group concerning the assembly of groups of animals for onward transfer to a single destination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the case relates to the availability of capital allowances for taxi licences. Provision was made for such allowances recently in section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001. Section 51 provides for a five year write-off of expenditure incurred on a taxi licence on or before 21 November 2000 at 20% per annum. Where the expenditure was incurred on or before 21 November 2000 it is deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 or, if later, on the date the trade commenced.</P>
      <P>The focus of the measure is to provide relief in respect of the cost of acquiring a licence to be used by the owner-operator of a taxi. Relief is not denied where the taxi owner-operator rents the vehicle to others on a part time basis. The measure does not give relief in respect of licences used by the owner for full-time rental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that in the case in question the person has five taxi licences, one of which he uses to operate a taxi service and four others which he rents full-time to other operators. Under section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001, he can claim capital allowances on the cost of the licence where he uses it for the purpose of his own taxi business. He cannot claim capital allowances for the cost of the four licences which are rented out. It is understood that he now wishes to transfer his own trade from the least expensive licence to a more expensive licence currently rented so as to maximise the tax relief available. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where the business is transferred in this way the capital <Col N="1238" /> allowances for the years leading up to the transfer are notionally deemed to have been made in previous years so that only a balance of the allowance would be available.</P>
    <P>If the taxpayer in question wishes to have further clarification on how this notional allowance would operate in his particular circumstances he should contact the direct taxes administration division of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin Castle at telephone number 6748017.</P>

      <P>The Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2001, does not specify that worker directors or members or representatives of any other particular interest groups should be included on the board of OSI. The reason for this is that I wish to ensure that there will always be flexibility in the configur<Col N="1240" /> ation of the board and I do not wish to tie the hands of any future Minister by putting into legislation a list of nominated groups who will always have to be represented on the board of OSI. Accordingly, although there is no specific provision in the Bill for the appointment of worker directors, this does not rule out the appointment of a workers' representative to the board.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that the Minister may appoint between four and nine ordinary members of the board. This range is sufficiently wide to ensure that, for any type of circumstances and environment in which the board must operate, there will be an appropriate number of members. The proposed maximum of nine ordinary members provides for representation of a wide range of interests &ndash; at present the interim board with just seven members includes representatives of map sellers, unions, employers and professional and recreational map users.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the projected total number of first-time buyer claimants of mortgage interest relief is estimated at almost 109,000 for each of the income tax years 1999-2000 and 2000-01. While this figure is a provisional estimate for both years it is particularly tentative in respect of 2000-01 and should be regarded as an indicative figure only.</P>
      <P>An estimated breakdown of the figures on a geographical basis is available on the basis of bailiwick which equates geographically with county while also providing separate breakdowns for city and county in the case of counties Dublin and Cork. By applying the percentage breakdown of returns by bailiwick for the income tax year 1998/1999, the latest available, to the projected number of first-time buyer claimants of mortgage interest relief for 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 the number of such claimants is estimated at 34,000 in Dublin city and 14,800 in County Dublin for each of the years in question.</P>
      <P>In considering the data it should be borne in mind that the allocation by county of PAYE employees, who represents the bulk of the claimants, is somewhat misleading because each employee is associated in Revenue's computer system with the county in which his or her employer is registered for PAYE purposes, regardless of the address of the actual workplace or of the individual's home address. Self-employed persons are associated on the tax record with the address at which the business is located, which may be different from the home address.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has completed a review of bed capacity. The analysis, which was accepted by the board in February, will inform the national review of bed capacity which is currently being finalised. I will bring the findings of the national review to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>The ERHA study found that the overall inflow of hospital admissions from other health board areas represents approximately 20% of activity within the region. In 1998, 35% of elective activity in the eastern region was in respect of patients from other health boards, as were 46% of transfer cases. The eastern region accounts for 41% of all acute beds nationally and 41% of activity nationally.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> The ERHA review report recommends that:</P>
    <P>Inflow of patients from other health boards outside the eastern region for routine elective procedures requires particular examination and the development of strategies to achieve appropriate in-flow to hospitals in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>It has long been the practice of Dublin hospitals to provide non-national specialty procedures to patients living outside the eastern region. I expect to see a reduction in the scale of such referrals as this Government's policy of addressing geographic imbalances in acute hospital service provision is implemented. Evidence of this policy can be found in the major capital developments being funded under the national development plan, for example at Limerick, Galway, Castlebar, Clonmel and Portiuncula hospitals.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the EU directives on the mutual recognition of foreign qualifications, the Minister for Health and Children functions as the designated authority for validating non-national qualifications for employment as a radiographer here.</P>
      <P>Citizens of an EU country with an EU qualification wishing to work in Ireland must apply to me in order to have their qualifications recognised. Assessment of such non-national radiography qualifications are carried out by the designated competent authority, that is, the Irish Institute of Radiography. The EU directive lays down a maximum timeframe for this validation process of four months from receipt of a completed application. If the application is not complete and it is necessary to request additional information from the applicant, the four month timeframe is suspended, pending receipt of the additional information necessary to complete the application.</P>
      <P>Graduates of the United Kingdom must therefore apply to the Minister for Health and Children to have their qualifications validated before they may work in the public health service. The process is complex, as it involves the designated competent authority satisfying itself that the training received by each applicant is comparable with that provided by the Republic of Ireland training courses, and the time taken to complete the validation will reflect this. Every effort is taken to complete the process as quickly as possible given these considerations.</P>
      <P>My Department has engaged in talks with the Irish Institute of Radiography on the question of streamlining the validation process and a revised process should be in operation later this year. It is the intention of both parties that the revised process will streamline the processing of validation requests.</P>

      <P>My Department does not keep statistics on the number of nursing students who cease their studies each year. The only available information on this subject was published last September in the interim report of the steering committee overseeing the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. I am arranging for a copy of this report to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The information was compiled by An Bord Altranais at the request of the steering committee and relates to the period 1990 to 1998. It indicates that during that period a total of 595 students discontinued their studies while a further 115 students who passed their exams did not register with the board. It is important to bear in mind that these figures include registered nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration training as well as pre-registration nursing students. The position is further complicated by the fact that the category of pre-registration students includes those trained under the apprenticeship model and those undertaking the nursing diploma programmes. The first diploma programme was introduced in 1994 and the transition to that revised model of training was completed in all schools of nursing in 1998.</P>
      <P>Anecdotal evidence suggests that the numbers of students dropping out of the diploma programmes are significantly lower than for other third level courses. I have asked my Department to pursue with An Bord Altranais the need for a structured monitoring system in the light of proposed developments in pre-registration nursing education.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is statutorily a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made with An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir and I understand that a death may only be registered in the district in which it occurred. Where the deceased has been attended in his or her last illness by a doctor, the person seeking to register the death must produce to the registrar a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner. Where the death has not been registered within 12 months of the death, the authority of An tÁrd Chláraitheoir must be obtained prior to the registration of the death.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy the deceased died in 1999 <i>en route</i> to a hospital and it has been necessary to seek clarification as to the place of death. An amended medical certificate of cause of death stating the correct place of death has been requested and when that certificate is received the authority to register the death can issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to persons in Dublin is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority or ERHA in the first instance. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that the person concerned was placed on the category II orthodontic assessment waiting list in November 1994. High priority cases &ndash; category I &ndash; are dealt with on a priority basis. She was assessed and deemed eligible for treatment by the authority in February 1999 but due in part to a loss of qualified orthodontic staff, there were delays in providing orthodontic treatment. The chief executive of the authority has advised me that it hopes to issue this young person with an appointment in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The chief executive officer of ERHA has advised me of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: an additional consultant orthodontist has been appointed; the recruitment of another two consultant orthodontists is currently in train; two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more; interviews to recruit three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards have taken place and their appointments are under way; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards is being organised; a competition to fill the posts of dental hygienist in the area health boards will commence shortly; the previously vacant post of superintendent radi<Col N="1258" /> ographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James' hospital has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown Unit has been filled on a locum basis; a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James' hospital orthodontic unit is being completed; the Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital; the working group established in the ERHA to report on the implementation of the grant-in-aid scheme is currently continuing its work to finalise the scheme; validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress; and agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists from the ERHA will commence training in 2001.</P>
    <P>The initiative in the ERHA will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to commence treatment. The most recent approximate figures from the ERHA on assessment and treatment waiting lists in the area health boards, received by my Department on 17 May 2001, is as follows:</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards/Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, the issue of making payments will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Never<Col N="1261" /> theless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

As an interim measure, following discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, the number of student places for speech and language therapy was increased by eight, from October 2000. Unfortunately, the capacity of the colleges does not allow for any further expansion in the number of places. However, I am confident that a substantial number of additional training places will be provided as a result of the report by Dr. Bacon.</P>

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines (ex manufacture) in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association or IPHA, formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries or FICI, which provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products. The current agreement expires in mid 2002. The negotiation process to extend the present agreement is currently under way between my Department and IPHA. It is not possible to say when the process will be completed.</P>

The examination of the medical manpower forum report will have particular regard to the likely benefits to patients, continuity of care, work patterns-clinical responsibility and professional development in a system which is less dependent on doctors in training and more on the changed work practice of an increased number of consultants. It is my intention that the main focus should be placed on introducing the necessary changes within those specialties where most of the public hospital workload arises, such as accident and emergency, general medicine, general surgery, orthopaedics and the necessary support services.</P>

      <P>The provision of school health services including school medical examinations, as an integral component of child health services, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. As a result of a need identified in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of child health services including the school medical services. This review resulted in the recent publication of the report Best Health for Children at the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>In so far as school medical examinations are concerned, the report makes a number of recommendations. The report recommends a core programme for child health surveillance for all primary schools, in close co-operation with parents and teachers, at ages 5-6 years, 7-8 years and 11-12 years and with selective medical examinations of children with problems.</P>
      <P>Health boards are in the process of reviewing the child health services with a view to bringing them into line with the recommendations in the report. A sum of £800,000 was allocated to the health boards this year to assist the boards in implementing the recommendations. In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a national conjoint child health committee and appointed national child health co-ordinators for the purpose of overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of Best Health for Children in the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the implementation of the recommendations of the report, the school health service, including school medical examinations, is currently being considered. In this context the child health co-ordinators have indicated that the <Col N="1270" /> North-Western Health Board will pilot the new school health service model including the core screening programme as set out in Best Health for Children. The pilot will commence in September of this year. The board has established a steering group to monitor the implementation of the pilot and is in the process of recruiting a project manager. The national conjoint child health committee will keep the Department informed of progress in relation to this pilot programme.</P>

      <P>Phase 2 of the major capital development programme at Naas General Hospital commenced on site in November 1999 and is programmed for completion by mid-2002. Funding for the development is provided for under the national development plan. On completion of phase 2, the hospital will have a total of 189 beds, including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the psychiatric unit provided under phase 1. Phase 2 includes the following facilities: main entrance concourse; administration &ndash; part; medical records department; chaplaincy department; out-patients department; accident and emergency department; physical medicine department &ndash; temporary location; radiology department; mortuary &ndash; post mortem accommodation; pharmacy department; geriatric day hospital; operating department; day services department; intensive care and coronary care units; in-patients wards; geriatric rehabilitation-assessment ward; staff changing &ndash; brought forward from phase 3; on-call accommodation &ndash; brought forward from phase 3; stores &ndash; brought forward from phase 3.</P>

      <P>My Department supports any measures taken by the public to maintain their own health. However, the debate last year concerning traditional medicinal products served to alert the public to the fact that &ldquo;natural&rdquo; does not always equate with safety where medicinal products are concerned. The number of traditional medicinal products on the market is increasing and the fact that they are largely unlicensed and not subject to control is a matter of concern. I am concerned to ensure that the public health interest is protected and that there is no undue delay in achieving this objective. The debate on traditional medicinal products has also highlighted the lack of a common approach at EU level in regard to the regulation of these products. While the matter is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU pharmaceutical committee in 1999, it is not anticipated that there will be an early resolution to the significant lack of harmonisation in this area. In recognition of these difficulties I have asked the Irish Medicines Board and officials of my Department to investigate the possibility of developing an interim licensing system for traditional use products which would allow such products to be lawfully marketed in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has recently submitted an interim report on the matter to my Department and has set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to advise on scientific and policy issues relating to the proposed scheme. This group includes persons with backgrounds in <Col N="1272" /> both conventional and non-conventional medicine. The Irish Medicines Board is anxious to ensure that the general public and interested organisations have a mechanism by which to make their views known in the course of this process. I share the board's concern in this matter. The board is therefore continuing to consult with the various interested groups and individuals and has advised me that following further consultation with interested parties, a draft of the final proposal will be submitted to me later this year.</P>
    <P>I have also proposed that a consultative forum be held to discuss the issue of statutory registration of providers of non-conventional medicine and therapy. A date for this forum has yet to be decided, but it is likely to occur shortly.</P>

      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, the DCSS, and drug refund scheme or DRS. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. A common list of reimbursable items is in place for the general medical services and drug payment schemes to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available, additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis. A comprehensive <Col N="1273" /> range of medicinal products authorised and recommended in the treatment of asthma are included in the list.</P>

      <P>While significant additional resources have been <Col N="1274" /> made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities and those with autism, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services.</P>
      <P>In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. This might include the purchase of additional sessions which may result in either the maintenance of the existing levels of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated for these services. It is a matter however for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.</P>
      <P>I have just received the report that I commissioned from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in relation to workforce planning for speech and language therapy. I am considering its implications and will shortly be in a position to announce developments in this area.</P>

      <P>The domiciliary care allowance, or DCA, is paid by health boards in respect of eligible children up to the age of 16 years whose disability is so severe that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be less than 16 years of age; the disability-handicap must be present at the time of the application and be likely to continue for at least a year; the disability-handicap must be so severe that they require from another person constant care or supervision, i.e. continual or continuous care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age and sex; and the constant care or supervision must be provided by the parents themselves or by another person by arrangement with the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> Only the means of the child should be taken into account in determining eligibility for an allowance &ndash; the means of the parents should not be considered. 'Means' in this context include payments of compensation, following a court action or otherwise, in respect of injuries or disabilities sustained.</P>
    <P>The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained in institutions on a full time basis. From April 1 2001 DCA is paid on a <i>pro rata</i> basis for periods spent at home, e.g. weekends or holidays by eligible children who attend special residential schools and institutions.</P>
    <P>Where there is more than one eligible child in a family, a full DCA payment should be made in respect of each child. In some cases, depending on medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals, e.g. if the child's condition improves, he or she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular case outlined by the Deputy, the assessment of entitlement to and payment of the DCA in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board with a request that he examine the query and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>My Department has fully supported the development and introduction of the accreditation programme in the eight major academic teaching hospitals or MATHs. Funding of £2.4 million has been made available to date for that purpose. The accreditation programme will formalise standard setting and measurement across many aspects of a hospitals' operations. The focus of the standards is on the patient as he or she moves through an episode of care in the hospital. Standards have now been developed around five interrelated functional areas applicable to each participating hospital: patient service groupings, leadership and partnership, information management, environment management and human resource management.</P>
      <P>Development work on the accreditation scheme is now complete. Irish standards have been drafted, field-tested and approved by the participating hospitals and the national steering group. These standards have also been validated internationally by the International Society for Quality in Healthcare. A team of Irish surveyors has been assembled and trained. The scheme will operate initially in the eight MATHs hospitals. The first hospital survey is planned for early 2002, with the remaining seven hospitals to be surveyed in the following six months.</P>
      <P>I am bringing proposals to Government with a view to establishing an accreditation body on a formal basis. In the interim, an implementation steering group or ISG has been established to roll-out the scheme to the participating hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A notable feature of the accreditation programme, which I very much welcome, is the relationship which has been established between <Col N="1277" /> the MATHs group and the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland, IHAI, the representative body for private hospitals in Ireland. The IHAI and the MATHs group began to develop Irish accreditation schemes at different times and from different standpoints. However, they are now actively pursuing measures to bring about convergence of their respective endeavours. While I understand that convergence may take some time to achieve, it is my strong view that the interests of patients and health care providers will be best served by having an agreed set of standards in Irish health care.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Rural Development provided that administrative procedures would be introduced to ensure awareness of the likely impact of all policy proposals on rural communities. The national development plan was prepared with due regard to this requirement. It is also mandatory for all operational programmes developed under the NDP to monitor the impact of the implementation of these programmes on rural communities. The national roads and public transport sub-programmes of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme were subject both to eco-audit and to assessment for rural impact. Regarding the environmental impact of national roads, the operational programme undertakes that particular care will be taken in route selection and design in order to minimise visual intrusion and impacts on habitats and to avoid severance of communities and land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding rural impact, improvements in both roads and public transport infrastructure are forecast to facilitate greater and more cost effective travel throughout the country, improving access to services and employment. Improved infrastructure should also boost the attractiveness of rural areas as locations for economic activities and provide improved support for industries such as tourism, fishing and agri-food. The strengthening of infrastructure within the BMW region, in particu<Col N="1279" /> lar, in conjunction with the measures undertaken through the productive sector, human resources, rural development and regional operational programmes is designed to facilitate a narrowing of both economic and social regional imbalances.</P>

      <P>County councils and county borough corporations are the only housing authorities legislatively empowered to carry out the full range of housing functions under the Housing Acts, including the payment of disabled person's and essential repairs grants. The borough corporations, urban district councils and town commissioners, although they carry out other housing functions, do not administer the essential repairs grant. The relevant county council operates the scheme on their behalf. I extended the essential repairs grants scheme to urban areas in December 1998. At that time five county councils and all five county borough corporations did not operate the scheme. A number of these have introduced the scheme since then and I am now informed that, currently, only three of the 34 relevant authorities do not administer the scheme, namely, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, and Cork and Limerick Corporations.</P>
      <P>Under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, it is a matter for local authorities to decide whether they pay grants under the scheme. However, my Department has recently written to each authority indicating the importance I attach to the availability of the disabled person's and essential repairs grants schemes in each local authority area. I consider that potential beneficiaries should not be excluded from grant assistance simply because they reside in the administrative area of a particular local authority.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I increased the percentage recoupment that is paid by my Department to local authorities from 50%, which it was when I took office, to two thirds of the amount of the grant paid by the local authority. I have also increased the maximum amount of my Department's recoupment to the local authority per grant paid on three occasions, bringing the maximum recoupment per grant from £900 in 1997 to £5,000 currently. As a result, the effective maximum essential repairs grant available has been increased from £1,800 in 1997 to £7,500 now.</P>

The manual is intended to assist local authorities to provide cycle facilities to a uniform and high standard. Ensuring the safety of cyclists was an important <Col N="1287" /> consideration in developing the manual, which drew on international practice, particularly from the Netherlands and the UK. The manual sets out comprehensive guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities, and includes suggestions for the use of raised edges as a means of segregation.</P>

      <P>Essential repairs grants are administered by local authorities in accordance with the Housing (Disabled Person's and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993 and guidelines issued by my Department. The regulations and the guidelines give certain discretion to the local authorities in relation to the nature of works to be grant aided, the determination as to whether an application meets the eligibility criteria, the amount of assistance to be provided, the relative priority of applications, etc. The grants are available to elderly persons living alone or with other such persons and are payable in respect of houses which cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost in circumstances where, with the carrying out of necessary essential repairs, the life of a house would be prolonged to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. Authorities may pay grants up to the full approved cost of the repairs and recoup two thirds of their expenditure on such grants, to a current limit of £5,000 in any one case, from my Department.</P>

      <P>Section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966, provides the statutory authority for local housing authorities to charge rent for the tenancy or occupation of their dwellings. Since 1986, responsibility for making and amending rent schemes has, in pursuance of Government policy of maximum devolution of functions to local authorities, been devolved to the authorities as an integral part of their functions to manage their housing stock, subject to the following guidelines: the rent payable should be related to the income of the tenants and a smaller proportion of income should be required from lower income households, allowances should be made for dependent children, a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners and provision should be made to accept a lower rent in exceptional cases, where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
      <P>Local authorities should also ensure that overall rental income reflects adequately, in so far as is practicable to do so, the management and maintenance costs of the dwellings under their control, having regard to appropriate local factors.</P>

Driver formation is being assisted in a number of ways, including the introduction of a driver theory test for applicants for first provisional licences which I recently announced. Various suggestions for schemes of graduated driver licensing have been made to my Department, including that referred to in the question.

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by health boards. Neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to assist eligible persons who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. Entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement is determined by health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their mortgage because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their mortgage repayments.</P>
      <P>The scheme operates on the basis that the person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. The principle is not, and never was, taken into account in the calculation of the mortgage interest supplement because it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has been contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that she is in receipt of the maximum amount of mortgage interest supplement payable to a person in her circumstances. Details of the calculation of her mortgage interest supplement are as shown in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <P>The Government's approach in this area to is to maximise responsibility for housing under the Department of the Environment and Local Government. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance to be operated by local authorities. In that regard, I understand my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will bring detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objectives of the new scheme will be to ensure that a full range of housing options is available to people with long-term housing needs, including those on local authority waiting lists <Col N="1296" /> who are renting in the private rented sector. The Government has also taken a number of other initiatives to improve the supply of social and affordable housing. The priority therefore is to provide housing solutions rather than social welfare solutions to meet the housing needs of people on low incomes. Given that context, I do not propose to introduce a new consolidated housing supplement scheme within the social welfare system to address the needs of working single parents.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might wish to note that the Barrow navigation was transferred from CIE to the State under the Canals Act, 1986. There is a statutory obligation under this Act on waterways authorities to provide for the care, management and maintenance of the navigation. In such circumstances, the question of applying formal cost benefit analysis in respect of navigational maintenance and improvement works may not be appropriate although due care is exercised to ensure that such works are at all times carried out in a cost-effective manner.</P>

      <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities. My role is to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. This is reinforced in the recently enacted Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. Under the provisions of the act, each planning authority shall, for the pur<Col N="1299" /> pose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures. A planning authority must have regard, under the Act, to any recommendation made by me. However, a decision may be made not to comply with a recommendation, provided that an explanation is made outlining the reasons why inclusion in the record of protected structures is considered inappropriate. I can confirm that last February I recommended to Sligo Corporation that a total of 284 structures be placed on its record of protected structures.</P>
      <P>I should add that it is open to anybody, including the owners or occupiers of such buildings, to make written objections or observations to the planning authority with respect to any proposed addition to or deletion from the record of protected structures. Under the legislation, responsibility for the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a record of protected structures rests with the elected representatives. In this regard, I await the considered response of Sligo Corporation to my recommendations.</P>

      <P>In early 1999, following consultation with representatives of the farming organisations and turf cutters, I announced a package of measures relating to the protection and conservation of bogs that have been proposed as candidate special areas of conservation, SACs, under the EU habitats directive. These measures included a ban on the use of sausage machines in such areas, necessary because of the significant damage they cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced a package of compensatory measures, including the purchase of turbary rights <Col N="1300" /> from those cutting for their own use who were disposed to cease cutting immediately, a provision for the cessation of cutting by domestic cutters to be phased in over a ten year period and compensation for commercial cutters who were required to stop cutting immediately. Persons whose turf was cut by sausage turf machine would be eligible for such compensation. Restrictions on turf cutting, including the use of sausage machines, were confined to areas included in SACs. There are no restrictions on the use of hopper machine types. These measures struck the correct balance between our conservation responsibilities under the EU habitats directive and the needs of local communities. They were advertised in the national and local media and also through meetings at local level with my Dúchas officials. I am arranging to forward for the information of the Deputy a copy of our press releases from that time.</P>

My direct participation consisted of meeting the promoters to highlight the advantages of <Col N="1301" /> Ireland as a film location, and to assure them that in the event of the project locating in Ireland, every possible assistance would be given by the relevant agencies. I also arranged meetings with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence which I attended. The producers ultimately decided to locate the production in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>The general issue of Internet safety for children is included in the brief of the Internet Advisory Board which I established last year. The board has already taken a number of initiatives in this area, including the commissioning of research on Internet safety issues in Ireland, an awareness campaign for parents which will be run later this year and the setting up of the board's Internet safety website this summer. The board has also been engaged with the Irish Internet service provider industry in the development of new codes of practice which are expected to be agreed within the next few weeks. All these initiatives have a role in improving safety aspects of children using the Internet.</P>
      <P>Apart from the development of an appropriate range of domestic safety initiatives, my Department is also involved in ongoing international co-operation at EU level in major Internet safety programmes and in developing mutual assistance measures for tracking and identifying illegal use of the Internet. Notwithstanding continued efforts at national and international level, the particular problem of access by paedophiles to children using the Internet continues to pose challenges for law enforcement authorities worldwide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the requirement that non-EEA nationals must renew their permission to remain at their local Garda registration office. Renewal of permission to remain for holders of valid work permits is a straightforward process and gives rise to very little inconvenience at most Garda registration offices throughout the country. In Dublin, however, registration takes place at the immigration registration office at Garda headquarters in Harcourt Square. This office has experienced unprecedented growth in demand for its services in recent years, which has led to delays for persons seeking to register or renew their permission to remain. The number of persons registered at the immigration registration office reflects the increase in migration to the State generally and has grown from 12,803 in 1998 to 26,641 in 2000, an increase of 108% in two years. This comprises all categories of persons, including persons with work permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The Garda National Immigration Bureau, established following a Government decision of 9 May 2000, has as one of its key responsibilities the co-ordination of registration services throughout the State. Since its establishment it has made significant progress in improving the quality of the service provided at the immigration registration office. The number of civilian staff has been more than doubled from ten to 24 and the opening hours have been extended in order that the office is now open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. between Monday and Thursday and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday. Temporary additional accommodation has also been made available.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department in consultation with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, carried out a review of registration requirements earlier this year and as a result has introduced a number of measures designed to streamline the operation of the registration system. Certain categories of non-EEA nationals will no longer be required to register as often as heretofore thereby reducing the numbers who are likely to attend on any given day. In view of the annual nature of the work permit, holders of such permits will continue to be required to register annually. As other categories such as spouses of Irish nationals will be attending less frequently, there will be less overall demand on the office's operation. The scope for further streamlining of the operation is being kept under ongoing review.</P>
    <P>My Department is consulting with the Office of Public Works with a view to securing a new and far larger building for the Dublin office, to enable more persons to be dealt with at any given time and improve the quality of service generally. It is hoped to have this accommodation in place by the end of this year. Furthermore, the Garda authorities are in the process of seeking tenders for the provision of an IT system to make the registration service more efficient. The Garda National Immigration Bureau has my full support in its efforts and I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in respect of future needs arising in relation to all aspects of the bureau's work.</P>

      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999 and the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Act, 2000, was commenced in full on 20 November 2000. Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications or appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage. A decision on the application in question will be made upon receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Work permits are a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Asylum seekers do not have the right to work pending a final decision on their applications. However, as an exceptional measure, the Government agreed on 26 July 1999 that those asylum seekers who were in this country for more than twelve months and who were awaiting a final decision on their application for refugee status should be given the right to work. The arrangement applied to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July 1999, as soon as they crossed the twelve month threshold. The arrangement does not apply to persons who applied for asylum after 26 July 1999.</P>

      <P>Records in my Department show that this case concerns a fatal road traffic accident that occurred involving a Garda car and an elderly female pedestrian. Circuit Court proceedings were subsequently initiated by the deceased's next of kin through his legal representatives. A monetary amount lodged in court by the State was accepted by the deceased's next of kin. The legal costs incurred by the next of kin's legal representatives, as taxed by the Chief State Solicitor's office, were also paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I would be reluctant to agree to release official records without first being aware of the identity of the person <Col N="1307" /> who is seeking the records and his or her relationship to the person about whom the records are held. I can, however, confirm to the Deputy that I am prepared to consider any request from a person with a legitimate interest for access to the records held by my Department in relation to the accident.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly that exists in the capital grants scheme for self-employed child care providers whereby a building can only be purchased with the grant aid if the building has been previously used for child care; if his attention has further been drawn to the impracticality of this stipulation in small urban areas; and if he will relax this regulation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, a capitals grant scheme for self-employed private providers and community based not for profit groups is part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-06. EU and Exchequer funding totalling £344 million has been allocated to my Department over the course of the national development plan between 2000 and 2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
      <P>There is no anomaly with regard to the use of a capital grant for the purpose of purchasing a building that has not previously been used for child care. Under Rule No. 6 of the Council Regulation laying down detailed rules as regards eligibility of expenditure of operations co-financed by the Structural Funds, the cost of real estate is eligible for co-financing by the Structural Funds under certain conditions if there is a direct link between the purchase of the building and the objectives of the operation. Funding may therefore be allocated for this purpose, once it has been established to the satisfaction of the committee dealing with the appraisal of the equal opportunities childcare programme that the building in question will be used for childcare and that it is appropriate for use as a child care service. This will be subject to compliance with regulations and planning permission where necessary. A capital grant may also be used for the building, renovation or upgrading of a child care facility and for the purchase of child care equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Applications for funding under the equal opportunities childcare programme can be made by submitting the relevant application form to my Department's equal opportunities child care section. Completed applications are assessed initially on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management Ltd. This is followed by an assessment by the programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department before referral to me for final decision. Applications are assessed according to the socio-economic profile of the area relating to the application, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the applicant to implement the project, the level of integration or co-ordination and the costings and value for money of the proposal.</P>
    <P>To date, I have committed funding in excess of £40 million to over 470 child care projects in the community and private sectors. This funding will support over 14,000 child care places including the establishment of almost 6,000 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services to extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. The measures in place reaffirm the Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person referred to by the Deputy alleged to the Garda that he was the victim of an assault at a night club on 30 May 1997. The allegation was subsequently investigated and the directions of the DPP were sought. I understand that proceedings were commenced by way of summons and the case first came before the District Court on 13 May 1998. The case was adjourned on several occasions and finally on 2 December 1998 the District Court judge dismissed all the charges against the person referred to and the other parties in the case. As the Deputy will be aware, the Judiciary is independent in the exercise of its functions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter.</P>

    <P>Furthermore, all Garda operational personnel have a responsibility for and are tasked with the enforcement of drugs legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific query regarding drugs task forces in each Garda division in the Border midlands west region, the position is that the recently published review of the national drugs strategy, Building on Experience, recommends a series of actions to be taken across the full range of Departments and agencies involved in the delivery of drugs policy at national and local level. The establishment of regional drugs task forces in each of the current regional health board areas is one of the recommendations. These task forces will address the entire range of drug related issues, including supply reduction. In this context, the Garda Síochána will be represented on these task forces and, accordingly, as part of the development of a co-ordinated and integrated approach to tackling the drug problems in these regions the issue of deployment of Garda resources will undoubtedly be reviewed by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>The present legal position in relation to trespass on land is that it is a civil wrong and for the most part falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. Nevertheless, the Garda Síochána is empowered to investigate criminal behaviour associated with such trespass, <Col N="1311" /> including extortion. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, can be used to deal with persons who demand money from property owners to end the trespass. The Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land, to remain in forcible occupation or to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation.</P>
      <P>It is also an offence for any person to trespass on any such place in such manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person. The Garda Síochána has the power to direct a person to desist from acting in such a manner and/or to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner. It is an offence for any person to fail to comply with such a direction from the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Where offences under the criminal law are detected, including relevant road traffic provisions, appropriate action, including prosecution, is taken by the Garda Síochána. In relation to the Deputy's proposal that I should consider a system of licensing caravans, I have no statutory responsibility in relation to vehicle licensing. While I have no proposals to change the law in relation to trespass, my Department will continue to keep the matter under ongoing review.</P>

      <P>I am in the process of finalising proposals which I will submit to the Government as quickly as possible in relation to new measures to be introduced to improve the arrangements for dealing with complaints against the Garda Síochána. I have noted the points the Deputy has put forward in this regard and I will take them into account in the context of the relevant issues.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has changed significantly since I took up duty as Minister in June 1997. The number of staff serving at that time was <Col N="1312" /> in the region of 2,950, which has risen to a figure of approximately 3,950, exclusive of Gardaí and prison officers. Growth in numbers has been driven mainly by the establishment of independent agency-type structures, principally the Courts Service, the Equality Authority, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations and the Prisons Authority.</P>
      <P>During my term as Minister a huge increase in demand for services has arisen in the areas of asylum and immigration. As a result I have secured an additional 650 posts approximately and have established the Refugee Applications Commission, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Reception and Integration Agency. In addition to the above there has been a very considerable increase in demands in other areas of my Department and in this regard I have recently approached the Minister for Finance with a view to securing additional resources for areas such as probation and welfare service, Land Registry and Garda civilian staff.</P>
      <P>There are a number of vacancies in my Department, as with any other Government Department. Every effort is being made to fill these vacancies and a number of recruitment competitions are ongoing in the relevant areas. On 22 April we availed of the public sector recruitment fair at the RDS to promote various career options within my Department which are open to potential employees.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the current equal opportunities child care programme was launched in April 2000 and is for the seven year period 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>The total amount committed by my Department so far under the equal opportunities child care programme in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to ten child care providers or child care groups in Roscommon is IR£805,111. Over 120 new child care places will be created and the retention of almost 200 existing places in County Roscommon will be assured as a result of this funding. This funding will also lead to improvements in quality and, in some cases, allow child care providers extend their opening hours. Details of these child care providers or child care groups are outlined in tables 2 and 3 below.</P>

      <P>A common theme in the consultations leading up to the publication of the national drugs strategy review was the need for the creation of a structure which has the capacity to reflect and respond to the drugs problem on a national basis. The local drugs task forces, LDTFs, are a specific response to the scale of the drugs problem, in particular disadvantaged urban areas.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in the context of the review, there was an examination of what structures might be appropriate to tackle drug misuse outside the LDTF areas. The result of this examination is the proposal in the new national drugs strategy that new regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, should be developed. These task forces would incorporate and expand the work of the current regional drug co-ordinating committees. Each RDTF would be responsible for putting in place a strategy specifically for their region and have a budget to develop and support the implementation of their action plans. It is planned to have the RDTFs in place by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I recently met representatives from Carlow Regional Youth Service to discuss their proposal for a central youth facility for Carlow town, in the context of the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, which is the main prevention component in the Government's national drugs strategy. The development group for the YPFSF in Carlow, which includes representation from the Carlow Regional Youth Service, had made a submission to the national assessment committee, NAC, of the YPFSF in late 2000 for the development of a central youth facility for the town and for advice on how best to progress the project. It was informed at that time that no additional funding would be available from the YPFSF outside of its existing allocation prior to the commencement of round II of the fund in 2002.</P>
      <P>In this context, the development group made a further submission to the NAC in April 2001 for a change of use of some of its existing funding in order to facilitate the development of the necessary plans to secure planning permission for its proposed youth facility. After a meeting between a delegation from the development group and representatives of the NAC on 15 May, this proposal was approved at the most recent meeting of the NAC and that decision was communicated to the Carlow development group.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the feasibility study, A Stadium for the New Century, which was placed in the Oireachtas Library in January 2000. The study provides an analysis of the transportation methods likely to be used to access the site on event days and presents estimates with regard to the number of spectators, which will access the stadium by car, coach, shuttle bus and rail. In addition, the feasibility study highlights infrastructural improvements required to facilitate access to the stadium. The study highlights a number of projects proposed in the draft Fingal county development plan, 1998, which will upgrade the transportation infrastructure in the vicinity of the site and facilitate access <Col N="1319" /> to the stadium. The study also suggests additional infrastructural improvements proposed to meet the specific transportation requirements of the stadium.</P>
      <P>Finally, the study suggests traffic management measures, which would be required on event days. It was recommended that these measures be developed further at the detailed design stage. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, is doing this.</P>
      <P>The architectural framework and environmental plan for the Abbotstown site, launched on 23 February last, outlines a logical and coherent approach to the development of the site. As part of this plan, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited is developing a transport strategy as part of the planning scheme that is being prepared. A full environmental impact statement, which will include a detailed analysis of the potential impact of the development of Sports Campus Ireland on the immediate area, will be conducted, which will include a transport study, and will be submitted to Fingal County Council at the relevant time.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to ensure that an adequate transport infrastructure is provided in the area and has established a specialist high level group to look at the public transport needs of the campus in terms of; metro link from Dublin Airport and the city centre, which is already planned as part of the platform for change strategy prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office; developing rail infrastructure on the Maynooth line, which passes close to the complex and can provide access from the west and the city centre; enhancing bus links and quality bus corridors; access to the complex by improving road alignments with the M50.</P>
      <P>The investment in improved road and rail links and other transport services to support the Stadium Ireland complex will also be of benefit to the local communities in the vicinity of the complex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 and 343 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule that is formulated for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
    <P>The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the Breaking the Cycle pilot project. Since its introduction in 1996, schools selected for inclusion in the urban dimension of the pilot project have been allocated sufficient staffing resources to enable them to operate within the maximum class size of 15 pupils in all junior classes. In line with the arrangements for mainstream staffing, these staffing allocations are also determined by reference to the schools enrolment at 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
    <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and four mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 127 pupils at 30 September 1999. In addition, the school has been allocated one disadvantaged concessionary teacher, one learning support teacher, one special class teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>By virtue of its inclusion in Breaking the Cycle and on the basis of its enrolment figure at 30 September 1999, the school has been allocated one Breaking the Cycle teaching post in the current school year. In addition, in September 2000, as an exceptional arrangement, the school in question was allocated an additional temporary teaching post for the duration of its participation in the initial pilot phase of Breaking the Cycle.</P>
    <P>Due to a decrease in enrolments on 30 September 2000 to 123 pupils, the school referred to by the Deputy requires one teaching post less for the 2001-02 school year than the number required in the current school year to stay within the maximum class size guidelines under Breaking the Cycle. Therefore on this basis, one Breaking the Cycle teaching post is due to be withdrawn at the end of the current school year. Following recent communication from the school I have asked officials of my Department to examine the situation in the school to see if there are any special circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, to tackle educational disadvantage which was launched by me in January of this year.</P>
    <P>The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension and the school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme. In addition to the additional resources allocated under the Breaking the Cycle scheme and the additional temporary teaching post, the school was allocated an additional grant of £2,337 under the new programme.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Education and Learning, which I propose to establish, will involve the partners in education and will have terms of reference covering a wide range of issues, including legal and management structures, developments in education and teaching, the role of the teacher, teacher training and accreditation, support systems for schools and teachers and lifelong learning.</P>

      <P>In early November 2000, I requested the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to set up a task group to examine the question of driver education in second level schools. The group was given three months to report on the subject. I understand that the task group met on two occasions, on 5 December 2000 and on 17 January 2001. The NCCA submitted a report to me on the work of the task group on 5 March 2001.</P>
      <P>The basic recommendation of the task group is that a three-phase pilot project on driver education be set up in order to: provide a critical overview of current provision and practice in driver education and general road safety programmes in the Republic of Ireland; evaluate an initiative already in place in a Dublin school; and undertake a national pilot project in driver education which would run in a small sample of schools under carefully monitored conditions.</P>
      <P>Arising from this project, the task group would be in a position to advise me on the future direction of driver education.</P>
      <P>I informed the NCCA on 8 May 2001, that it will be necessary for the relevant sections of my Department to discuss the considerable funding implications of the proposed project before a decision is taken. The relevant officers of my Department will initiate these discussions as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students, other than independent mature students, the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances, in any case where the student is not categorised as an independent mature student.</P>
      <P>Waterford Vocational Education Committee, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, has confirmed that the student in question was ordinarily resident with his parents from 1 October prior to entering his course at Waterford Institute of Technology, in the 1999-2000 academic year. Accordingly, he must be assessed as a mature candidate dependent on his parents. As the reckonable income in this case exceeds the prescribed income limits under the scheme, he has been deemed ineligible for a maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>As the schemes of student support are of general application, it is not open to me to make an exception in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The planning section of my Department requested patron bodies involved in primary education if they wished to assume patronage of a new primary school for the area.

The most that my Department can offer is concessionary fare-paying transport subject to there being room available on a service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated and provided no extra State cost is involved by way of extending or altering the bus route. It is not open to my Department to allow an extension of route in this case as the pupil is not eligible for transport.  </P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the apparently inconsistent processing of four grant applications from one family (details supplied); his views on whether the four to seven children figure is appropriate in this case; if he has satisfied himself that this family is receiving its proper entitlement to maintenance funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 2000-01 academic year, where there are less than Part 4 dependent children, is £20,200. The income limits increase accordingly where there are between four and seven dependent children, £22,200, and, again, where there are more than eight dependent children, £24,100. The parent or guardian of a candidate may not be included when calculating the number of dependent children, for the purpose of the means test.</P>
      <P>A sliding scale of entitlement exists whereby candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part maintenance grant of 50% in respect of which the income limit is £21,400 where there are less than four dependent children, £23,400 where there are between four and seven dependent children and £25,500 where there are more than eight dependent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 2000-01 academic year where two or more children or the candidate's parent are pursuing a course of study listed below, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,270 where there are two such children, £4,540 where there are three such children and so on, by increments of £2,270: attending full-time third level education; attending a recognised PLC course, student nurse training or student garda <Col N="1332" /> training; participating in a CERT course of at least one year's duration; attending a full-time Teagasc course in an agricultural college, or attending a recognised full-time further education course of at least one year's duration in the North.</P>
    <P>With regard to the family in question, two of the children and the children's mother applied to Wexford County Council for grant assistance under the higher education grants scheme, 2000. A third child applied to County Wexford VEC for grant assistance under the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>My Department has discussed the case raised by the Deputy with Wexford County Council and with Wexford VEC and has requested further information regarding the manner in which reckonable income was assessed. When this information has been examined I will arrange for a full response on the matter to issue to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, County Wexford VEC, the body which administers the relevant scheme, referred a query concerning the calculation of reckonable income to my Department. The matter was referred for professional accounting advice within my Department. Consideration of the issues involved is nearing completion and a response will issue to County Wexford VEC in the near future.</P>

      <P>Staffing levels in vocational education committees are reviewed from time to time by my Department.

      <P>In the case of the VEC concerned all administrative posts sanctioned by my Department have been filled by the VEC. Accordingly, a permanent appointment cannot be made.

      <P>School attendance is currently governed by the School Attendance Act, 1926. Under this Act, responsibility for the enforcement of school attendance rests with the school attendance committees in Dublin city, Cork city, Waterford city and the county borough of Dún Laoghaire-Blackrock, and the gardaí for the remainder of the country including the Ballymun area. I assure the Deputy that I share her concern about non-school attendance and early school leaving. It is for this reason that my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board and a nation-wide educational welfare service, with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. My Department has requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Departments, <Col N="1338" /> and these have now been received. It is my intention to have the board in place very shortly.</P>
    <P>The number of educational welfare officers required for the implementation of the Act will be determined by the board as part of their preparations for the full implementation of the Act. It is my intention that the new educational welfare service will, ultimately, cover the entire country. The service will be implemented on a phased basis, in line with a plan to be developed by the board. The priority in the initial stages will be on areas of disadvantage generally.</P>
    <P>In January last I announced the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. This programme will cost some £26 million over a three-year period. Under the programme, schools with the highest concentrations of pupils at risk of not achieving their potential in education are targeted with extra teaching and financial assistance to provide additional in school and out of schools supports for the pupils concerned. There are a number of other programmes in place to address educational disadvantage at both primary and second level. These include the Early Start pilot project, Breaking the Cycle pilot project in primary schools, the disadvantaged areas scheme, home/school/community liaison scheme and the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative which cover both levels, the Stay in School retention initiative at second level and learning and support teachers. Many pupils in the Ballymun area are already benefiting from these initiatives.</P>

For example, to date, there are a number of inter-agency working groups for the implementation of adult guidance, the development of an assessment framework for adult literacy, the co-ordination of radio and TV developments for adult literacy, an interdepartmental group on literacy for the unemployed, the implementation of the national qualifications structures, the funding and implementation framework for the back to education initiative, the review of administrative, organisational and technical structures for the PLC sector, the steering group for the education equality initiative. All such groups include Department staff, key education interests, and where relevant, other agencies such as FÁS local employment service, Department of Social Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and community and voluntary sector interests.</P>
      <P>At this stage, critical developments have been implemented in adult literacy, increasing participation from 5,000 in 1997 to 17,150 at the end of 2000, from expanding to 595 venues, strengthening referral networks, introducing a quality framework, providing nationally certified staff development programmes, expanding family learning, piloting workplace learning, and implementing national TV and radio programmes so that people can learn in the privacy of their own homes. In addition, work has been advanced in testing models of practice in relation to the needs of non-nationals, such as asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
      <P>The back to education initiative will come on stream later this year. The adult guidance service began in 2000, and applications have been invited for phase 2 of the initiative with a view to selection next month. The education equality initiative is up and running and the outcomes from the previous women's education initiative have been disseminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Qualifications Authority was established on a statutory footing at the end of February 2001 and the new awards councils for further and higher education will be set up shortly. Consultants have been appointed to undertake a review of the PLC sector and a steering group has been established to oversee the process, with a view to a final report in November. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy to be implemented on a phased basis <Col N="1340" /> in the context of the Estimates and the funds available under the national development plan. Implementation of the recommendations is being co-ordinated by my Department.</P>

      <P>The back to education initiative announced in the Government's White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, provides for a merging and continuation of existing levels of provision under Youthreach, Traveller, vocational training opportunity scheme &ndash; VTOS &ndash; and post-leaving certificate courses, allied with a significant expansion of part-time options.</P>
      <P>To address needs in this area, the back to education initiative will provide for an improvement in the student teacher ratio to 10:1 for all participants accessing the programme with less than upper second-level education. Discussions are currently under way to finalise a the funding framework and implementation arrangements for the expansion of part-time options, and the 10:1 ratio is being examined in that context. I hope to implement the first round of the new initiative later this year with the funds being provided under the Government's national development plan.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. The VTOS, which is operated through the 33 vocational education committees, has a total of 5,000 places filled annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, a quota, which limited the participation of dependent spouses of people eligible to join VTOS, and other categories of people, was removed to support wider access. The latest <Col N="1341" /> statistics show that 1.86% of VTOS participants are dependent spouses of people eligible to join VTOS. VTOS is targeted specifically at the unemployed, and there are no plans at present to widen access to the programme.</P>
    <P>Participation in full-time education on post-leaving certificate courses and on third level national certificate, diploma and primary degree programmes is free, and there are means-tested maintenance grants available. The forthcoming expansion of part-time options under the back to education initiative will increase the availability of flexible re-entry options to further education. Provision will be free for people and their dependants who are in receipt of medical cards, means-tested welfare payments, or family income supplement. In addition, there will be fee relief for other categories who are unwaged and who have less than upper second level education. Plans are under way to implement the programme later this year.</P>

      <P>The Irish Pharmaceutical Health Care Association has, in conjunction with a lecturer from the School of Science and Technology, Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, designed a module for transition year and leaving certificate applied students. This module is called Medicines and You. It aims to heighten the awareness of young people to the need to be careful with medical prescriptions, to store medicines properly and to read carefully the instructions on all medicines.</P>
      <P>The module consists of seven units as follows: getting the best from your medicines; managing your minor ailments effectively; introduction to medicines; medicines and disease; preventing disease: the role of vaccinations; researching and developing new medicines; and the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Each unit is independent and consists of teacher guidelines, student information sheets, student activity sheets and a glossary. The module was recently sent out to five pilot schools in Mayo, Galway, Meath, Cork and Kilkenny. The schools have expressed great enthusiasm for the materials and expect to use them on a trial basis in September.</P>
      <P>This module has applications in the leaving certificate applied and in career investigation work in the leaving certificate vocational programme. Some leaving certificate applied teachers have piloted the materials and found them effective but as yet no decision has been taken to introduce the module formally as part of the leaving certificate applied. If, when the piloting phase is over, this module is evaluated positively, it will be available to schools in the same way as a large number of similar modules. The social, personal and health education programme, SPHE, which focuses on a much broader range of health issues, is being introduced to the junior cycle of all second-level schools at present. This initiative is supported by a group of 20 trainers, jointly formed by my Department and the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 367 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 350 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has a learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department if the schools meet the defined criteria. The school's board of management has decided not to proceed with their appeal and have withdrawn their application for retention of the 13th mainstream teaching post at the school.</P>

      <P>I have requested the National Youth Work Advisory Committee to prepare a national youth work development plan. The plan will provide a blueprint for the development of youth work in Ireland for the next five years. A wide ranging consultative process has already taken place and I envisage that the National Youth Work Advisory Committee will be in a position to present the plan to me in mid-2001.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to reducing the number of pupils, including young single parents, who leave school before completion of the senior cycle. My Department does not prescribe any special rules for the treatment of pregnant schoolgirls by school authorities, however I expect that in dealing with any particular case school management would have regard to the sensitivity of the situation with its priority being the well-being of the pupil concerned. I hope pregnancy causes no more than a temporary absence from school and that each pupil would be in a position to resume her education following the birth of the child. It will be appreciated that no two sets of circumstances will be identical and, accordingly, management practice will vary from case to case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant the school authorities check to ensure the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding while trying to ensure her education is not neglected. Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are pupils at recognised schools. It is provided to pupils who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of <Col N="1348" /> a baby when attendance may be impractical. The intention is to provide compensatory instruction during the time immediately before or after the birth of their babies when attendance at school may be impractical.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the tuition will minimise the disruption to the girls' education and so maximise their chance of continuing in school to complete the senior cycle. This is in line with Government policy to improve school retention rates, as it will enable pupils to sit the junior or leaving certificate examinations at the earliest possible opportunity. Schools are expected to support pregnant schoolgirls and my Department is willing to offer these pupils some practical support.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made at examination time for a pregnant girl depend on her particular circumstances at the time. A candidate may not wish to sit her examinations in the main centre, in which case she may take her exams in a special room in the school. If a candidate is in hospital, arrangements can be made for her to take her exams there. If a candidate feels unwell during the course of the examinations she may be allowed leave the examination centre and readmitted provided she has been in the care of the principal or a representative of the school authority during her absence. In exceptional circumstances a candidate may take the examinations at a later time than scheduled, but on the same day.</P>
    <P>In 1998 a scheme of childcare was introduced for early school leavers on youthreach and senior traveller training centre programmes and for unemployed adults on VTOS. The scheme provides funds for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on community or commercial crèches, or payment of childminders subject to tax compliance and registration as required with the health boards. Some 1,308 children and 1,050 parents are currently benefiting from the measure at a cost of £2.4 million per annum.</P>

      <Quest>the situation regarding the introduction of a leaving certificate examination in physical education; if he has received a report from the NCCA on this matter; if so, if he will publish this and forward a copy to Deputy Creed; and if he will comment on the sports infrastructure in our schools in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The NCCA published a draft syllabus for leaving certificate physical education for consultation in August of last year. Following an extensive consultation process, the final draft of this document is being revised by the NCCA course committee prior to being presented to council. The NCCA has produced a report on the consultation process which has been circulated to members of the NCCA Council. It is anticipated <Col N="1349" /> that the syllabus will be presented to me in the near future along with a proposed implementation plan detailing a time schedule and resource implications. I will arrange for a copy of the report to be made available to the Deputy when I receive it.</P>
      <P>In common with other leaving certificate subjects each school will make a decision on whether or not to offer physical education as an examination subject. Such decisions will be based, among other things, on the availability of suitable facilities and on the availability of suitably qualified teachers. The physical resources available in the schools for the teaching of physical education as an examination subject will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the new leaving certificate course. Information on the quality and standard of such resources will be referred to in the planning and implementation strategy.</P>
      <P>The new leaving certificate examination in physical education will be introduced to schools on a phased basis. This should avoid overburdening schools and teachers and allow for gradual adaptation to the changes envisaged. The phased nature of the implementation should allow schools to make the necessary infrastructural changes in advance of introducing the subject for examination. When I receive the final syllabus documentation, including proposals for implementation, from the NCCA my Department will put in place a comprehensive implementation strategy that will identify and address human resource issues and capital resource implications.</P>

      <Quest>the number of children repeating a year at primary school in a given year, or any related statistical information which his Department may have on this issue; his views on recent proposals to withdraw this entitlement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1999-2000 school year 6,941 children repeated a year in their own school and 566 repeated a year in another primary school. This information is based on data submitted by boards of management of primary schools to my Department. In recent years, my Department has allocated considerable support for pupils with learning difficulties. Learning support teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants and a wide range of resources under the various schemes for schools in areas designated as disadvantaged are among the forms of provision allocated to schools for these pupils. I am confident that the level of provision available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively <Col N="1350" /> through the different class levels in the school in keeping with their peers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there may be individual cases where a principal teacher, following consultation with the learning support teacher and class teacher and parents of the pupil, concludes that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for a second year. In such cases my Department would support the retention provided there is an educational basis for it and a clear programme for the pupils to follow. In this regard my Department recently issued a circular to schools outlining the policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils. This policy was already outlined in rule 64 of the rules for national schools and in a previous departmental circular, 10/67. The recently issued circular, primary circular, 11/01, reaffirms the policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils.</P>

      <Quest>the schools on Dublin's northside which have been included in the initiative giving children an even break; the support made available under the scheme in respect of each; and if he will indicate those in respect of which a teaching post was due to be withdrawn under the new schedule of pupil to teacher appointments 2001 to 2002.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed information sought by the Deputy is currently being compiled within the Department and it will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly. The new programme giving children an even break programme has both an urban and rural dimension. A total of 815 schools have been invited to participate in the urban dimension. I am committed to supporting urban schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class, over the three-year period. In addition, all participating schools will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of schools supports for the pupils concerned over the three year period.</P>
      <P>The retention of the additional teacher posts under the new programme is subject to existing enrolment levels being maintained over the three-year period of the programme and the implementation of the maximum class sizes within the schools concerned. In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations made under the programme are determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes on 30 September in the previous school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the review of pupil enrolments on 30 <Col N="1351" /> September 2000, some schools which were included the new programme were due to have teaching posts allocated under that programme withdrawn at the end of the current school year owing to falling enrolments. Notwithstanding <Col N="1352" /> changes in enrolments in September 2000 and in view of the special nature of the scheme, I have authorised the retention of the posts involved up until the 2002-2003 school year. The position will be reviewed in the light of enrolments on 30 September 2001.</P>
