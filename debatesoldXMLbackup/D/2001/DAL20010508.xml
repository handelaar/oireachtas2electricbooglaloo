    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am to meet with the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Goran Persson, on Wednesday, 30 May during his tour of European capitals in preparation for the European Council meeting at Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June. If necessary, I will of course be in direct contact with other colleagues. Officials from my Department and other relevant Departments will be in contact as necessary with their colleagues in other member states and with the Commission. In advance of Gothenburg the Irish position on the various issues likely to arise will be prepared in the normal way through the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, it is the normal practice that the agenda for European Councils is finalised by the Presidency shortly before the meeting. However, as of now it is expected that major items for discussion at Gothenburg will include the progress of the enlargement negotiations and the adoption of an EU strategy on sustainable development. It is also expected that Heads of State and Government will meet President Bush.</P>
      <P>The President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, is to visit Ireland on the weekend commencing 21 June. President Prodi visited Ireland in his capacity as President designate in May 1999 and I look forward very much to welcoming him and taking the opportunity to discuss a range of EU issues in some depth. While the details of his itinerary are still being arranged by the European Commission office in Dublin, it is likely that his visit will include meetings with myself and other Ministers and with the leaders of the main Opposition parties. I understand that he has also agreed to make a speech at a dinner hosted by the European Movement.</P>
      <P>With regard to my visit to Iceland and my attendance at the UN General Assembly special session on HIV and AIDS, arrangements for these events are being developed at present and as such details are not yet available. It is proposed, however, that during my one day visit to Iceland on 25 June, I will meet President Grímsson and have a substantive meeting with Prime Minister Oddsson. Proposals for a meeting with senior business leaders are also being examined. In addition to my address at the UN General Assembly on HIV and AIDS on 26 June, I hope to hold a series of bilateral meetings with senior political figures from a number of African nations. I will also attend a working lunch hosted by Ambassador Richard Ryan, Ireland's representative on the UN Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans at present to hold any specific preparatory meetings in advance of my attendance at the UN summit. The Deputy may wish to <Col N="1143" /> note, however, that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs will hold a consultation meeting with NGOs and other interested stakeholders on 11 May. This meeting will examine the various issues that are likely to arise in the course of the UN special session and will inform preparations for my address to the Assembly. A separate meeting with representatives from the Irish pharmaceutical industry is also envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has an appalling record on environmental issues. The European Commission is already taking Ireland to court for failure to implement several important EU directives on water quality and waste management, and several other legal challenges are pending. Is the Taoiseach aware that new figures from the European Environment Agency prove that despite the Government's trenchant criticism of President Bush's withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol the rate of increase in emissions of carbon dioxide in Ireland is the highest in the European Union? Will the Taoiseach discuss this with Mr. Prodi and will he give undertakings at the Swedish summit when the issue of sustainable development, which he says is the second item on the agenda, is discussed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to discussing the issue of sustainable development. In advance of the Gothenberg meeting the European Commission has produced a consultation paper on the preparation of a European Union strategy for sustainable development. I will be supporting that consultation paper. It provides a good basis for work leading to Gothenburg. The themes identified in the paper give a solid starting point at which to develop appropriate policy initiatives, all of which we have been involved in, as well as providing a framework for focusing on the changes in policy areas which are needed if sustainable development is to be achieved.</P>
      <P>Like other countries, we have had some cases on which the Commission has taken action. Some of these range back over a number of years. However, the national climate change stategy which the Government has put in place is an appropriate framework for greenhouse gas taxation prioritising carbon dioxide emissions on a phased incremental basis from next year. We remain committed to this measure and will bring forward appropriate proposals in the budget next December. We recognise the importance of taxation measures to tackle climate change and we will advance that agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a range of other specific measures I am sure Deputy Noonan, like me, would support. For example, changes in building regulations will reduce the energy required for heating in houses by approximately 35%. We have been actively working in advance on the full implementation of that strategy which covers the 2002-03 period. The forestry service is committed to achieving an annual target of 20,000 hectares of afforestation. <Col N="1144" /> Good grants are available under the national development plan for those areas. In recent weeks, full market access has been granted to electricity for heat and power. Next year, two new gas-fired electricity generation plants will be in place. In addition, energy issues are also being dealt with by the Energy Council. We have been working on a whole range of issues to deal with this plan. We are committed to the plan and I look forward to reporting on it in Gothenburg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this, as in many other matters, the Government does not practise what it preaches. The Government has a hard neck to criticise President Bush at a time when carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland are the highest in the European Union. The European Commission is taking the Government to court on a series of legal actions because we have not complied with directives on water treatment and waste management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 96% of all EU environmental directives have been transposed into Irish law. We have taken action on many of these issues. The current predictions are that, in a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; scenario, Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions will rise by up to 37% over this decade, against a target ceiling of 13%. All countries will have to take radical action to meet their targets and we are no different. &ldquo;Business as usual&rdquo; is not an option. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has made that clear time and time again. Last winter he published a comprehensive national climate change strategy setting out a range of measures to be implemented over this decade which will ensure that we will not overshoot that 13% target ceiling. Work is already under way to ensure that the strategy measures for this year are implemented. These include the forestry research programme, developing climate change indicators and examining inward investment for its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Work will continue on that, not only this year but over this decade. This will occur in addition to the taxation issues related to greenhouse gas emissions, which I have already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government talks a very good game. At this stage of the game, however, when the Government has almost completed four years in office, it is about time the talk was followed by action. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has done nothing about waste disposal, apart from talking about it. He has done nothing to improve water quality either, apart from talking about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very badly informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has a frightful <Col N="1145" /> neck to criticise President Bush when our carbon dioxide emission levels are the highest in the European Union. What will the Taoiseach bring to the table when the issue of sustainable development is discussed at the Swedish summit? He should certainly not bring the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At Gothenburg I look forward to discussing what we are doing and to adhering to the EU position on the Kyoto Protocol. As the House will be aware, US President Bush made a statement that the US would no longer pursue the implementation of the protocol and that has significant implications for those committed to combating global climate change and to working on the issues which I outlined, including waste management, afforestation and CO2 emissions.</P>
      <P>The EU actively participated in the high level consultations in New York the week before last in an effort to reach a compromise solution to the impasse. These negotiations examined compromise proposals prepared by the president of the Sixth Conference of the UN Framework on Climate Change and the Dutch Minister for the Environment and, hopefully, some issues will be resolved. The EU Presidency has also had extensive consultations with partners in the rest of the world to try to get the Kyoto Protocol back on track. Many areas of common ground have been identified which will lead to finalising negotiations.</P>
      <P>Ireland is, however, committed to the Kyoto Protocol and will continue to work on the process involved in all areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I move to a different issue, when the Taoiseach appeals for support on a cross-party basis for programmes to deal with waste in local authorities, I will remind him that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is introducing proposals in the Waste Management Bill, 2001, to remove that function from elected members and to vest it in county and city managers. There will not be much point in the Taoiseach appealing across the House when councillors will no longer have that power.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan will ask a supplementary question. This is Question Time, not a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach probably has got it right because the Minister for the Environment and Local Government never finishes anything he starts and it will probably still be an issue for elected members.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will address the special session of the UN General Assembly on HIV and AIDS. AIDS affects 36 million people worldwide. What does he expect will be achieved by this event in terms of the fight against the disease, particularly in Africa? What proposals will the Taoiseach bring to the session on behalf of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reported several times during Question Time over the past number of years that our initiative at the EU-Africa Summit early last year led to a substantive debate and to the EU bringing forward a policy on the issue. I led the campaign on behalf of Ireland Aid, Irish religious organisations and NGOs to get this issue on the agenda of the summit. We also wrote extensively not only to Prime Ministers and Ministers but also to many agencies about this issue. This proved quite successful in obtaining co-operation within the EU and getting Romano Prodi to take up this issue and provide assistance.</P>
      <P>We also have allocated a substantial contribution from our own resources to UN AIDS relief. Ireland Aid will contribute approximately £1.5 million to the international AIDS vaccine initiative. We contributed practically no money to that up to a few years ago. We have pushed this issue and our NGOs in Africa work in many hospitals which care for AIDS victims. They have co-operated with Ireland Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government generally over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will follow up on what was agreed at Cairo last year and the major agreement that was successfully reached at the EU recently. We will also discuss the decision of 39 major pharmaceutical companies to drop their legal action against the <Col N="1147" /> South African Government and to reduce the cost of anti-AIDS drugs. All of these matters will be discussed. Our case has been based around access to affordable drugs, resources being put into prevention strategies, education and general health programmes and the development of care of orphans. They were the headings under which I campaigned and lobbied both at EU level and at the Cairo Summit and we will bring that to the UN. Since we took over our seat at the UN our officials there have continued to use their position, not on the Security Council but within the UN areas, to highlight this issue and the UN High Commissioner will attend a conference in Africa at the end of August. Our credibility, therefore, in this area is strong and we will continue to try to keep this issue at the forefront of UN health policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware of German Chancellor Schröder's proposals on the future of the European Union and that those proposals have received a fairly cool response from some colleague states, particularly France and Great Britain. What are the Taoiseach's views on these proposals and does he believe it is now necessary for the EU leaders to set out a clear blueprint for Europe after Nice so that our people, and the people of other member states, have a clear notion of where Europe is going? Does the Taoiseach agree with Chancellor Schröder's proposals or does he have an alternative view? If he has an alternative view, what is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on a leaked document, that has been denied, from a draft policy paper on the SPD Party which is to be launched in the autumn because I do not know Chancellor Schröder's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Taoiseach knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a leaked text of the document.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Financial Times</i> will give the Taoiseach his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on a leaked draft. On the debate generally, two countries to date, perhaps three &ndash; Antonio Gutteres gave his views last night on the future of Europe debate &ndash; have given their views and it has been agreed that we will have a preliminary discussion at Gothenburg and that at Laeken, in Belgium, just before Christmas there will be the first substantial debate on this issue. Deputy Noonan is right in that we have to address that issue after Nice. All the countries are being asked for a comprehensive, wide-ranging debate on this issue involving not just parliamentarians but as many people as possible making up the community of countries engaging in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as there is a German input, Franz Fischler gave his view in Heidelberg University <Col N="1148" /> last year and the argument will come down around a federal Europe and whether it should be a big jump or a continuation of the incremental stage. We will have to work out a mechanism here to address that debate and get a broad input to it. That is already being examined by the European affairs committee. We will not come to any conclusions on the issue until after the Nice referendum but it is an issue in which we will have to involve people. Needless to say, the European affairs committee will have to discuss the best way to move it into a broad ranging debate so that we can get the substantive views of the widest section of public opinion on how we should move on over the next four or five years on the other side of enlargement. The view being taken is that this will be the major issue for the next ten to 15 years so whatever happens in 2004, 2005 or 2006 &ndash; it really starts in 2004 &ndash; this should be a move that will hold the test of time until 2015 or 2020. This will be an important debate for the Union in which we will play our full part. Deputy Noonan will appreciate, however, that I am not willing to provide any views as yet on what course the debate on the future of Europe should take. We must deal with the Nice treaty in the first instance and then give consideration to the debate on the future of Europe, which will take place during next year and the year after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate why the Taoiseach would be reluctant to comment on statements made by the Prime Minister of another country. However, while he has called for a debate, he appears to have no intention of contributing to it other than in terms of commenting on the proposals of others. Has the Government a view on how Europe should develop post-Nice? If so, will the Taoiseach outline some of the opinions of the members of the Government so that the debate in Ireland can commence? It is not adequate to merely call for a debate. At present, as far as Ireland is concerned, the debate will take place in a vacuum unless we discuss the proposals made by others. The Taoiseach, however, has stated he is reluctant to do the latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform Deputy Noonan of the exact position because I believe he is operating under an enormous misapprehension. The Nice treaty must be ratified by the end of next year. The debate on the future of Europe cannot begin until that process is completed. The meeting in Laeken in December will be the first occasion on which that debate will be dealt with. The views of one country have been advertised via a leaked document and Antonia Gutteres has given a two and a half page speech on the matter. The debate in question involves the future of Europe following the passage of the Nice treaty, which must be ratified by 31 December next year. There is no debate on the future of Europe at present. However, such a debate will occur when the Nice treaty is ratified.</P>

        <b>:</b> In light of the calamitous situation which exists regarding HIV and AIDS, namely, the countless millions of people infected in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, and the hundreds of thousands of children left orphaned as a result, will the Taoiseach, when he attends the United Nations General Assembly's special session on HIV and AIDS, for once forget his reluctance to upset United States-based multinationals and the US <Col N="1150" /> Administration and launch an international call for anti-HIV and anti-AIDS life-saving drugs to be prised from the grasping hands of pharmaceutical companies that control their distribution at present? Will the Taoiseach use this opportunity to call for the establishment of an international agency to manufacture these life-saving drugs and distribute them free of charge to the impoverished millions who cannot afford to buy them? It should be remembered that the pharmaceutical companies were forced to back off in South Africa because world opinion was against them. Will the Taoiseach make his mark by calling on the world powers, for example, to produce a few less warships and fighter planes and on his own Government to produce a few less tanks and to divert the resources into a major programme to put people before profits? He would be guaranteed the support of hundreds of millions of those who are disenfranchised by the increasing policy of globalisation which gives multinational companies huge power over poor people, including the power of life and death. He should lay down a marker in relation to the terrible affliction of HIV-AIDS instead of the usual bland speeches from many world leaders which mark such occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of what the Deputy said. I am sure the Deputy would give credit to the Government which has pressed hard on this issue and on some of the other issues the Deputy raised. We have taken an active view on the AIDS issue. I give much credit for that to the religious NGOs and the NGOs generally. I have seen at first hand the work in which they are involved. We have pressed this issue and some of the other issues the Deputy raised both bilaterally and at international level and we will continue to do that. Ireland Aid has mainstreamed the HIV-AIDS issue across its development activities. It has not only asked other countries to do it, although they have more resources. We have prioritised our resources and we have led much of the work in Zimbabwe and Ghana where the Irish programmes have been successful. We have increased substantially the contribution to UN aid. We will also contribute to the international AIDS vaccination initiative.</P>
      <P>We will press the pharmaceutical companies not just to use their products in the way they do but to assist in all the preventative strategies. They have started to move in that direction in recent years, although I know it is not fast enough. Huge multinational companies are involved in this area. It was a step in the right direction when the 39 pharmaceutical companies dropped their case in South Africa recently. The UN will try to get substantive resources for preventative strategies which require enormous finance. Deputy Noonan mentioned the large numbers which are constantly growing. It is a huge political and health issue in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> We have also pushed plans to deal with general health sector development and the care of orphans. Ireland is in a strong position and Ireland Aid has strong credibility in this area. I will make the case about the drugs issue, as I did in Cairo and Europe when it was discussed two years ago.</P>

      <P>As regards the Swedish summit and the agenda of the Swedish Presidency which relates to the environment, does the Taoiseach agree that the figures now published which show Ireland nine percentage points above the 20 year acceptable figure for greenhouse gas emissions makes the target we solemnly entered into unattainable? Does he further agree that the national greenhouse gas abatement strategy published last year has not been meaningfully implemented since then? Will he give us one instance of the fiscal measures which flowed from that strategy that have been implemented to date? </P>
      <P>As regards HIV-AIDS, has the Taoiseach taken initiatives to talk to the pharmaceutical manufacturers' association to press the point that in order to stem the epidemic which now affects 36 million people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative to make affordable drugs available to those people and countries which are not in a position to pay current commercial prices? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the agenda for the summit in my reply to Deputy Noonan. In relation to the environmental issues, it is no surprise that there is a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; policy and a 9% increase. That situation is set out by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in the national plan. The Minister has outlined that the &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; strategy does not work&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the fiscal side the Minister has outlined that measures will be introduced in this year's budget. There may be no need to discuss other matters if the Deputy is interested only in the fiscal side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so, but we will see if that is the case. The plans for forestry, electricity generation, renewable energy, public transport and building regulation are important, although any one of them will not solve all problems. The Minister has agreed that to be the case in both the national plan and the national climate strategy. He said that it will be the sum of all measures <Col N="1152" /> which will achieve solutions. People must wake up to those realities. It is not easy to get the necessary co-operation as there is an awareness of the issues by the public, but also a reluctance to move on those. The Minister is making progress.</P>
      <P>On the question of HIV, the Government has been pressing the matter both internationally with colleagues and locally. The local companies and the pharmaceutical side are reporting back to their head offices. The campaign aims to get pharmaceutical companies to take an entirely different attitude than previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach had personal meetings with such people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and there will be further meetings before the Gothenburg summit. The association of pharmaceutical companies worldwide calls the shots in this regard and it is necessary for all with influence to press these companies to make the required changes. They had an unreasonable position and tended to look for the same costs and prices from poor countries as from wealthy western countries, which was an impossible request. Anyone with knowledge of health services, even on a small scale, knows there are brands of drugs, not on the listed scheme, that can be used in these countries.</P>
      <P>The pharmaceutical companies can do what is required. They are not being asked to do it all over the world, yet their attitude has been consistently disappointing at international conferences. I understand that the pharmaceutical industry must make money to re-invest for research and development. However, the companies are not being asked to put products into western markets with large profit mark-ups but instead to put them into the poorest countries in the world. The combined level of poverty in those countries is enormous and their combined wealth is less than 1% of the world total. The pharmaceutical companies should provide their products to these countries. This is not an unfair request and the UN effort at the AIDS conference will be to press this case again, supported by eminent experts in the field, to try to force change. This is most important in relation to sub-Saharan Africa where the situation is worst. It is a reasonable case which Irish and other NGOs have worked hard to put forward. I will make that case again strongly next month.</P>

      <P>I always thought of the Taoiseach as an astute political operator but he is not living in the real world if he thinks he can defer the debate on the future of Europe until after the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. Those who will campaign against the treaty in the coming weeks will raise these issues and the Taoiseach must be in a position to address them. The Fine Gael Party will campaign in favour of the treaty but the campaign will be a shaky one if this is the kind of lead the Taoiseach intends to provide. Does he <Col N="1153" /> have a view on where Europe should go as EU membership increases to 25? Does he have a view on any of the proposals emanating from other member states and, when the debate gets under way, will there be a clear Irish position or will the Government simply piggyback on the views of others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on the future of the EU are extensively outlined in the November document, a copy of which I will forward to the Deputy. Deputy Noonan kindly listened to me outline those views in person in the EU. There is an agreement that a comprehensive debate on this issue will kick off at Laeken in the autumn and member states will work on their position papers between now and then. Part of Gerhard Schröder's paper has already been leaked. I spoke to the German Foreign Affairs Minister when he visited Ireland last week and he told me not to pay too much attention to the leaked document as work on the position paper is ongoing. Antonio Guterres of Portugal issued a two and a half page statement in which he outlined the view that this should be a small rather than a big step.</P>
      <P>We have already commenced work on devising the best formula by which Ireland can address this from a parliamentary point of view and from the point of view of other groups, not only people with an interest in Europe. We want to elicit the views of ordinary people who do not normally involve themselves in this type of debate. I hope to be in a position to outline the Irish position at Laeken in September.</P>
      <P>The ground rules of the debate are spelled out in four or five points which emanated from the Nice conclusions but I believe the debate will be far more wide ranging. The issues to be debated will range from the possibility of having a federal government with a federal budget to continuing to operate on a smaller scale. There is no draft blueprint at this point. A diary of events will be drawn up in Gothenburg but no policy statement will be made there. The debate will commence in Laeken and will proceed in readiness for an Intergovernmental Conference in summer 2003.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Future of Europe&rdquo; debate, so titled following the Austrian summit, has not yet commenced. I have already outlined my views and those of the Government on the key issues. This debate will continue over the coming years and we must set out our views on the matter. We will, I hope, be in a position to outline our preliminary views by September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer the question I put to him and we are quite clearly at cross purposes. He replied at the level of high politics about a debate which will commence between governments at Laeken. I am not talking about an intergovernmental debate but a debate between ordinary people in Ireland who want to know, in advance of casting their vote on 7 June, what will happen after the Nice Treaty and what will be the next step. I put it to the Taoiseach that <Col N="1154" /> that debate has already commenced and that so far the Government has not brought forward any answers. It is not enough to say you will inform everybody about it after Laeken. It might be too late then. In terms of the public debate on the future of Europe, will the Government put forward proposals in the context of the referendum campaign. If not, who do they expect to answer the points made by those advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in that campaign?</P>

If the very substantial issues that remain to be addressed post-Nice are to be addressed in an inclusive manner, has the Taoiseach given consideration to the proposal by the Leader of the Labour Party to have a forum analogous to that on peace and reconciliation which brought together the views of Nationalism on a visionary agenda? Will he agree that that type of forum could be well utilised to ensure the broadest possible consensus of opinion about the shape of a future Europe in the issues to be decided in the years immediately ahead? </P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Taoiseach agree that in the remarks made by Chancellor Schröder in Berlin yesterday calling for the EU's executive commission to become a strong pan-European Government and for sweeping budgetary powers for the European Parliament lies the real agenda involved in enhanced co-operation as envisaged in the Treaty of Nice, the creation of an elite inner circle of the more powerful states? Does he agree that Chancellor Schröder has let the cat out of the bag? Is he embarrassed by those remarks given the commencement of the campaign for the ratification of the Treaty of Nice here? Will the Taoiseach agree that it is probably only a matter of time before a similar clearer statement regarding the rapid reaction force is released?

      <P>Let us not mix up two different issues. The Treaty of Nice was negotiated last December, signed in February and is now before the people. What is involved in that treaty is enhanced co-operation, the Commission, the institutional issues, what will happen for the next four or five years and what will happen with enlargement. There is no change necessary this side of enlargement. That has been agreed by all member states. Enlargement to 27 states and the necessary institutional changes will take place. No other issue will affect that. A further Intergovernmental Conference, which will take at least three years &ndash; probably four or five years &ndash; to establish, will consider the other issues involved. We have yet to set up a structure in that regard.</P>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Howlin's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. There is merit in the idea of a forum. Such a forum would be different from the two fora held over the past 25 years &ndash; the forum to achieve a consensus among parties on the national issue and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation &ndash; both of which attempted to achieve Northern Ireland involvement.</P>
      <P>There is merit in trying to achieve more than simply the political view. All countries would agree that one has to try to reach out to all other groups and there is merit in examining this idea. This is one of the suggestions being looked at and I will outline by September how we will best do so. This work is ongoing in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I do not believe Deputy Joe Higgins's fears will be realised. As Minister for Labour in 1987 I heard similar concerns expressed in the House, not by Deputy Higgins, regarding the Single European Act. However, the concerns regarding our sovereignty and neutrality proved unfounded.</P>

      <P>Following discussions with the European Commission, I was pleased in March 2000 to announce significant increases, averaging 30%, in the rates of annual forest premium. For example, in the case of farmers planting broadleaves &ndash; oak and beech &ndash; in severely handicapped areas the annual premium increased from £265 to £373 per hectare. For farmers planting 20% diverse coni<Col N="1157" /> fers, the premium increased from £210 to £308 per hectare.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated, the application of the increased premiums to pre-2000 planting was an essential element of the case submitted to the European Commission in August 1999. From the beginning, however, the Commission indicated that this aspect would be problematic and the increased rates agreed in March 2000 did not apply to such planting.</P>
      <P>My Department made a further detailed submission to the Commission in April 2000 in support of such increases. I vigorously pursued this case at a number of meetings with the Commission in the latter half of last year. The question of applying the increase to those who had planted in the period 1993-99 was the subject of protracted discussions at all levels with the Commission. In spite of cogent arguments, the Commission remained steadfast in its refusal to co-fund the increases.</P>
      <P>Careful consideration has been given in the meantime to the question of the Exchequer bearing the full cost of the increases.

      <P>I am shattered by the reply. A total of 12,000 forestry farmers were promised they would not suffer any loss if they planted prior to the introduction of the new grant-aid levels. This is the fourth occasion on which I have tabled a question on this issue during marine questions. On the three previous occasions the Minister of State gave an undertaking &ndash; and I believe he was genuine &ndash; that the Government would pick up the tab. However, that has been knocked on the head today and that is a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that he and the Government have let down 12,000 farmers who believed they would be at no disadvantage in planting when they did? These farmers were led to believe by Ministers and others that the EU Commission or the Government would pick up the tab. The Minister of State assured me in the House one month ago that the Exchequer and not the EU would do so, and I accepted that assurance. The Minister of State also said he would bring to bear all the pressure possible in this regard.</P>
      <P>This is a bad day for forestry to which the Minister of State is giving a bad name. We should not do this to such an important industry. On the last occasion I said the Government was playing politics with this issue and I genuinely believe it is doing so.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should clarify for the Deputy that the North Atlantic Salmon Fund is an Icelandic-based voluntary organisation, mainly financed by private donations from individuals and groups. It is not an intergovernmental organisation and the question of Ireland or any other member state signing up to its charter does not arise. As a lobby group, the NASF works to conserve and restore North Atlantic salmon stocks by focusing in particular on voluntary quota buy-outs with commercial salmon fishermen through a mix of public and private funding. The fund has periodically brokered annual compensation agreements with Greenland, Faroese and Icelandic salmon fishermen and is lobbying for the closure and buy-out of commercial salmon net fishing in Ireland with matching public funding.</P>
      <P>I had discussions recently with Mr. Orri Vigfusson, founder and chairman of the NASF. Mr. Vigfusson is a regular visitor to Ireland and is campaigning intensively for a voluntary compensation scheme for the entire Irish commercial salmon sector. We had a good exchange of views during which I outlined our current salmon conservation strategies, including the significant restrictions in place since 1996 on the commercial salmon sector, the work of the national salmon commission and my support for pilot set aside schemes in individual catchments. Mr. Vigfusson reiterated his belief that the key to restoring salmon stocks lies in ending the commercial exploitation of salmon through voluntary buy-out. I invited Mr. Vigfusson to submit proposals on how, in practical terms, the NASF would envisage taking forward such a strategy in the Irish context.</P>
      <P>I have stressed to Mr. Vigfusson and Irish salmon interests generally that fishing effort for salmon at sea and in the rivers needs to be further reduced in the short term and I am reviewing the need for additional measures, informed by the ongoing advice of the salmon commission. The issues inherent in a complete voluntary buy-out of the Irish commercial salmon sector are very complex. The international experience is also mixed. I have also cautioned previously against excessive expectations about large amounts of compensation and it is not the case that all active commercial salmon fishermen are willing to be bought out. Simplistic solutions will not work.</P>
      <P>The NASF submitted outline proposals to me in recent weeks. I have asked my Department, the fishery boards, the Marine Institute and the salmon commission to examine and advise me on these proposals. On receipt of their collective advice, I intend to have further discussions with the NASF to explore in detail the practicalities, realism and cost benefit of its preferred strategy. I will also continue to look at other approaches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter repeatedly and it now appears that we are moving in the right direction. Does the Minister agree with a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 3 April in which Mr. <Col N="1160" /> Vigfusson stated that almost all the representative groups he had met had agreed to buy-out rather than set aside? Does he agree it appears a majority of fishermen are in favour of buy-out rather than set aside? Has he received any communications from the representative bodies to that effect because that opinion has been made known to me?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The salmon commission is currently exploring the possibilities of buy-out and set aside schemes. I received proposals from and had discussions with individual groups of fishermen and various views are held by them regarding the desire for buy-out or set aside. Some fishermen would consider set aside to ensure the conservation of stocks, but they would also like the opportunity to continue commercial fishing when stocks improve. Other fishermen would favour a buy-out. All these matters must be carefully considered and much discussion must take place.</P>
      <P>An important factor from the Government's point of view is the cost involved. Some fishermen have unrealistic views regarding the value of their licences in buy-out or set aside scenarios. As I said previously, there are no crocks of gold available for the buying out or setting aside of licences. There must be realistic discussions with fishermen before a conclusion can be reached in that regard.</P>

For example, if three people fish from the same boat, is it the case that the licence will be bought out and that will be the end of the matter or will the licence be bought out and the three people, who would be considered crew members under the regulations, compensated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of fishing opportunity available to the fishing fleet year on year is determined by overall decisions on total allowable catches taken by the EU Fisheries Council every December. The resulting national quota for each fish stock is monitored and managed during the year and, where necessary, specific management regimes are put in place in consultation with the industry. The purpose of these management regimes is to ensure the best possible spread in terms of take up of quota during the year, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions. The key objective is to avoid early closure of fisheries through premature exhaustion of quota. By imposing monthly or two monthly limits on the amount of a particular stock which may be fished by an individual vessel, a more equitable spread of quota is achieved among fishermen and throughout the year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, many key whitefish stocks are seriously overfished and a number of stocks are in crisis. The massive reductions proposed by the Commission for whitefish stocks, including cod, haddock, whiting and hake, were moderated in negotiation at the December Fisheries Council in favour of a more phased approach linked to stock recovery programmes for cod and hake.</P>
      <P>In the interests of best management of the reduced national quotas for monk, hake, plaice, cod and whiting in 2001, regimes are in operation which limit landed catches per vessel on a monthly or two monthly basis. While the haddock fishery in the specific Rockall area has been closed from 1 May, all other haddock fisheries remain fully open and the need for management regimes will be kept under review. Whiting fisheries which had been fully open are subject to a management regime with effect from 1 May. The monk and hake fisheries have been under a management regime since January, reflecting the significant reduction in quota as a result of the worrying state of stocks.</P>
      <P>Negotiations at EU level to settle the details of the stock recovery programmes for cod and hake are being finalised. The industry has been fully involved in these difficult negotiations and we have worked with the industry to ensure effective conservation measures to protect juvenile and spawning stocks are put in place across the board without jeopardising the interests of Irish fishermen.</P>

Is it the case that the haddock quota will be reduced by 50% or more and that 50% less whiting will be caught this year compared to last year? Will <Col N="1162" /> there also be huge reductions with regard to other species, including hake and monkfish? Will many of the fishermen, who previously fished such species on a full-time basis, be unable to fish such traditional species?

All reports, including those in <i>The Irish Times</i> and the<i> Irish Independent, </i>indicate that it is £6.5 million. Will the Minister of State clarify this aspect? Is the EU claiming that we unjustifiably received £3.8 million or £6.5 million? What is the interest cost on the money being reclaimed by the EU? That is not <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money sought by the EU Commission from us is £3.8 million. That is the sum it paid to Coillte Teoranta. Without wishing to incur the wrath of the Attorney General, it should be said that Coillte was included in our submission to the Commission when forestry premia were first introduced. At that time the Commission did not suggest that Coillte should <Col N="1164" /> not be paid. The Department proceeded to pay Coillte in the same way it paid others who engaged in planting.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the Commission took a different view and since then the Department has not paid Coillte. Perhaps that is where the figure of £6.5 million arose. The Commission takes the view it is owed £3.8 million but had we continued to pay Coillte to date the figure would probably rise to £6.5 million. On the basis of what happened at the outset it is our intention to continue to make a case for Coillte in this instance.</P>

      <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in pressing for a comprehensive and open debate on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy. Almost 20 years from its inception the CFP is faced with major challenges in conservation, economic and political terms. The serious state of fish stocks and over capacity in the EU fleet are the key conservation challenges. The economics of the EU fishing sector are increasingly worrying in a scenario of high costs, labour market difficulties and a shrinking resource base. Politically the challenges are to secure the involvement of the stakeholders in the decision making process and to create a level playing field in compliance and enforcement. To prepare the Irish position, the national strategy review group of the CFP was set up in December 1998 under the chairmanship of Pádraic White. The group has presented me with a series of reports culminating in the comprehensive proposals and recommendations published last November in advance of the Commission's Green Paper in order to influence and input into the Commission's thinking. The group's report has been widely circulated throughout the EU and I have discussed the <Col N="1165" /> report with EU ministerial colleagues and Commissioner Fischler.</P>
      <P>The Commission's Green Paper on the CFP was published last March. This discussion document will now be the subject of debate at EU level in the coming months. I welcome the Commission's intention to conduct consultation with all the players over the coming months. The strategy group intends to play a high profile role in this process, with my support. There will also be a major policy debate on the Green Paper at the Fisheries Council in June and I will work closely with the industry and the national strategy review group in developing our position on all the key challenges and options.</P>
      <P>We are now proceeding with a rigorous analysis of the Green Paper. My initial reaction is to welcome the fact that a number of Ireland's priority themes are reflected in the Commission thinking. These include the need for enhanced technical conservation strategies, a structural policy which delivers balance between fishery effort and available resources, increased involvement of stakeholders in decision making and a level playing field in fisheries control.</P>
      <P>The Commission accepts that fishermen and their organisations and scientists must be more involved in decision making and that we need more decentralisation through regional advisory mechanisms. I am pleased the work of the strategy group has contributed to the thinking in the Green Paper and we will continue to work to influence and shape the overall direction with the input and support of the group. Under the chairmanship of Pádraic White the group met Commissioner Fischler and EU officials last week and held more than one hour of discussions which I understand proved to be very fruitful.</P>

      <Quest>if he will meet, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, senior officials of Waterford County Council to discuss the ongoing dispute over the provision of a sewerage scheme for Cheekpoint, County Waterford, to resolve the problem regarding the issuing of a foreshore licence in order that the scheme can proceed without further delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will no doubt recall the response I gave to Question No. 80 on 28 June 2000, Question No. 15 on 23 November 2000 and Question No. 151 on 20 March last. The position is unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I wish to stress again that because of the proximity of commercial mussel beds and the serious risk to human health from viral contamination arising from sewage receiving only second<Col N="1166" /> ary treatment and having regard to the impact such contamination would have on the livelihood of Irish mussel fishermen, I will have to insist, as a minimum, on provision for retrofitting of UV or equivalent treatment. Deputy Deasy will agree that it is only prudent to ensure the operation of the plant and the impact of the discharge on mussels do not adversely effect human health. If the provision for retrofitting of UV or equivalent treatment was agreed, it would be possible at a later stage to upgrade the plant at reasonable cost should it be found necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>Until the council indicates that it is prepared to accept a provision for the retrofitting of tertiary treatment I cannot, in the interests of human health and the livelihood of local fishermen, approve the application. The polluter pays principle must apply here and, in addition to the health issues, I also have to consider the impact on the livelihoods of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department has to date received a request from Waterford County Council for a meeting on this issue. Officials of my Department are available to discuss the matter with officials of the council if required.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. I understood progress had been made. I do not know if the Minister is familiar with the village of Cheekpoint but the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will know it well. It is a beautiful little seaside fishing village in Waterford harbour. No development can take place there at present due to the lack of a proper sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>I agree that one cannot cause contamination to the shellfish industry in the village's locality but I had been given to understand that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and Waterford County Council had reached agreement with regard to the introduction of retrofitting of UV or alternative equipment so the health threat to the shellfish in question would be eliminated. Am I incorrect in that regard? Was there an agreement which has not come to light in the House today?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any agreement being reached. Tertiary treatment is required to prevent viral contamination of shellfish. It is really an issue for Waterford County Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to put in place tertiary treatment. I cannot and will not consider a foreshore licence until I am of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so. Without tertiary treatment, my scientific and professional advice is that it would be wrong to grant such a licence.</P>

Is the Minister prepared to let his officials meet officials from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and <Col N="1167" /> Waterford County Council to work out an agreement? Officials in Waterford County Council regard the demands being made as unreasonable. They are not unreasonable people so a conference between the three bodies concerned might resolve the difficulty and allow the village of Cheekpoint to be developed properly. It is incredible that no building permissions can be given without the sewage treatment plant being in place.</P>

It is a matter for Mayo County Council to decide. My Department received an environmental impact statement for an application for a foreshore licence which it found to be unsatisfactory. Consequently and following discussions with the Department of Public Enterprise, it has requested a new and more substantial EIS. I assure residents with concerns that there will be a rigorous examination of the application in all its aspects before any decision is taken by my Department, and I am sure Mayo County Council will do the same. We will be happy to make information available to the local community when it is appropriate to do so.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the proposal from drift net salmon fishermen to establish safety days in respect of those days in June and July when they are entitled to fish but may not be able to do so safely owing to weather conditions; his views on their proposals to allow them to carry over such days as safety days at the end of the season; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12748/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a document from the Irish Fishermen's Organisation entitled, Safety Aspects of Salmon Fishing Regulations. This document calls for the introduction of safety days which are explained as extra days which would be allowed at the end of the drift net fishing season to compensate fishermen for days during June and July when fishing is not possible due to bad weather.</P>
      <P>The drift net fishing season for salmon is limited to the months of June and July on a four days per week basis. This season was introduced as part of the range of salmon conservation measures made following publication of the report of the salmon management task force in 1996. As part of the package, the prohibition on the use of monofilament nets was lifted.</P>
      <P>The case made for the introduction of safety days is to remove the pressure on salmon fishermen to go out in adverse weather conditions. However, I am aware that other interests would take the view that this would in effect amount to an extension of the drift net fishing season and an increase in the level of commercial fishing effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal of the IFO is made in the context of the introduction of the national wild salmon tagging scheme which commenced in January of this year. The tagging scheme is designed as a <Col N="1170" /> means of counting the catch of fish by all sectors to inform the development of policy on the wild salmon resource which remains in a vulnerable state.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to examine the IFO proposal taking all perspectives into account, and I invite the National Salmon Commission to let me have analysis and advice on the proposal. The commission is representative of all the stakeholders in salmon, including the commercial and angling sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be a correct interpretation of the Minister's response to say that he is kicking to touch and that he has not been able to make a decision on the proposal from the IFO? There were a significant number of fatalities at sea last year &ndash; the figure was about 30. Does the Minister agree there should be considerable emphasis on safety? Does he not accept that, in many cases, those involved in drift net fishing use small boats and that it is not appropriate to place economic pressure on them to go out on days when the weather is bad? That is the basis for the proposal. Does the Minister not believe that while there should be balance, we should give priority to safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attempting to kick to touch. My inclination is not to extend the season. While I accept the argument about the absolute need for safety, given that we are talking about the months of June and July and in the context of the difficult situation of stocks and the need for conservation, in balance, I am not well disposed towards extending the season. However, I am prepared to await the advice of the National Salmon Commission in which all stakeholders are involved.</P>
      <P>One proposal I will announce shortly is to engage in a new initiative on the quality of wild salmon catches which can enhance considerably the value of salmon caught. This would be much more beneficial to fishermen than an additional day or two to compensate for bad weather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the Minister has come off the fence by indicating that he is against this proposal. I have an answer to the question I was asked to table by representatives of fishermen. I am in favour of conservation measures but am concerned in this instance with the safety aspect. Does the Minister accept a different approach could be taken, such as buying out licences from fishermen, and that whatever solution is arrived at should not involve putting pressure on fishermen to the extent that they could compromise their safety? Will he not examine the issue in the broader context to see whether drift net fishing can be reduced by purchasing licences rather than forcing drift net fishermen to go out in very bad weather which could lead to further fatalities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter before the Deputy came into the Chamber and proposals are <Col N="1171" /> being considered for buy out or set-aside. It would not be correct to confuse safety with days at sea. In the management of fishing resources, days at sea are a curtailing factor for all fishermen. That should not result in economising on safety.</P>

      <P>This question is similar to a previous one. The European Commission's Green Paper on the CFP was published in March and was formally presented to the Fisheries Council on 25 April. I welcome the Commission's intention to conduct real dialogue. I do not underestimate the challenges faced by the Irish fishing industry in securing the best outcome in the CFP review. Other member states have their own agendas, access rights and quotas being two in particular.

      <P>The success of the December Council lay in the fact that for the first time technical conservation measures, as opposed to the old tax and quota system, were to the forefront of EU policies, We are now seeing those measures being implemented by way of the hake and cod recovery programmes and the closure of other areas. The very problems which the Deputy identified in his first question are now being dealt with. These are necessary conservation measures but they are hurtful. If we are to grow stock we must conserve. It is in our interest to have this policy pursued in Europe and for the first time other countries are now supporting it. Some countries have a greater interest in using quotas and total allowable catches as their method of management because they have huge quotas compared with ours. There is a divergence of approach because of a difference between our interests and those of France, for example. We face a tough battle but we are convinced that the only way forward lies in proper technical conservation allowing juvenile fish to escape, closing spawning areas and allowing stock to recover and be managed in a proper fashion. The scientific evidence supports this approach.</P>

      <Quest>if he will instigate an inquiry into the way in which the chemical lindane was allowed to be used by Irish companies, including Coillte Teoranta, to the extent that ten tonnes of this toxic substance was used throughout Ireland in 1998; and the basis on which the use of such a substance was allowed for use.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is the regulatory authority for approving plant protection products for use in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plant protection products are regulated in Ireland by 1994 regulations which implement EU <Col N="1173" /> Directive 91/414 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. The legislation provides for a high standard of safety, based on an assessment of the risk to human and animal health and to the environment.</P>
    <P>A total of 37 plant protection products containing lindane held approval for use as a seed dressing, for the control of wireworm or as an insecticide in agriculture, horticulture, home garden and forestry in 1999. Following the introduction of annual renewal fees in 2000, only eight products continued to hold approval. Approval for these expired on 30 April 2001.</P>
    <P>The directive also provides for a review, co-ordinated by the Commission, of all active substances on the EU market within specified timelines. The review of lindane was concluded in July 2000 when the notifier failed, within the specified timelines, to provide the data required to demonstrate that the continued use of plant protection products containing lindane was sufficiently safe.</P>
    <P>Following the review, the standing committee on plant health voted unanimously not to include lindane in the positive list of active substances. This decision followed protracted evaluations and discussions dating back to 1998, with Austria acting as rapporteur for the Commission. The decision included provisions requiring member states to withdraw all authorisations within six months of publication of the decision and allowed a period of grace which &ldquo;shall be as short as possible and not longer than 18 months from the date of adoption of the decision&rdquo; to allow existing stocks to be used up. The Commission published the decision to exclude lindane in December 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>Ireland was anxious to implement the provisions as soon as possible. Therefore, it was decided to set 30 April 2001 as the date on which all authorisations would be withdrawn to coincide with the end of the spring seed treatment period.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of these decisions is as follows. No more lindane products may enter the supply chain after 30 April; lindane products in the supply chain after 30 April must be used before 31 December next; and lindane products not used before 31 December will have to be disposed of as toxic waste.</P>
    <P>While I have no function in the approval of plant protection products or their use by bodies under my aegis, I understand from Coillte Teoranta that in addition to conforming with all statutory requirements it applies very strict internal procedures in the application of pesticides.</P>
    <P>I understand that plant protection products containing lindane were used by Coillte for the pest management of the large pine weevil in reforestation operations. The treatment consisted of spot application to the plant stem. I also understand from Coillte that plant protection products containing lindane were replaced by plant protection products containing permaset from 1 January 1999. Residual stocks of products containing lin<Col N="1174" /> dane were largely used up during 1999 and such products have not been used since then. Any remaining stocks are being disposed of in accordance with the governing regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State regard the use of lindane as a thing of the past and will the Forestry (Amendment) Bill copperfasten that state of affairs? Does it surprise the Minister of State that most of the lindane used in 1998, the last year for which figures exist, was used by Coillte? Those figures suggest that ten tonnes of the substance was used by Coillte in that year. Is this acceptable to the Minister of State, given the information now at his disposal? What would he say to people who are concerned about the effects of lindane on their health, the health of their animals and on the environment?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be happy to hear that Coillte Teoranta has not used any product containing lindane since 1999. I am pleased about that.</P>
      <P>According to pesticide manuals, it would take 45 grammes, or more than ten spoonfuls of the most concentrated lindane product on the market, to kill a cow. This is considerably more than half a spoonful, which was suggested by the Deputy. There are either very small cows or very big teaspoons in his constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House are concerned about the news emanating from Northern Ireland. Does the Taoiseach believe that Mr. Trimble's threat to resign as First Minister of the Northern Executive poses the most serious threat yet to the Good Friday Agreement unless the republican movement makes a serious and credible move towards decommissioning by 30 June 2001? I know the Taoiseach will be aware of the surprise and disappointment expressed by spokespersons of both the SDLP and Sinn Féin. Will he agree that the onus to resolve this impasse now rests with the two sovereign Governments? Furthermore, will he make a commitment to this House that all the preparatory work necessary for negotiating a settlement will be made by him and the British Government and its officials so that when the new British Government takes office on or about 9 June, negotiations towards a resolution can commence immediately with a view to all-party agreement being reached on decommissioning and other matters before the de Chastelain mandate runs out on 30 June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of supplementary to Deputy Noonan's question, will the Taoiseach accept that there is a level of brinkmanship both in the statement of Mr. Trimble and the response of Mr. McGuinness to that statement that threatens to put at risk the acknowledged good work of the institutions put in place subsequent to the Good Friday Agreement? Has the Government plans to amend the decommissioning regulations, which are due to expire on 22 May, and in terms of those regulations what amount of time does the Taoiseach envisage will be required before the decommissioning commitments entered into by all parties in the Good Friday Agreement are achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan and Deputy Howlin for their questions on this issue. The Government is surprised by Mr. Trimble's statement. I met Mr. Trimble at some length, with his colleagues and my own, last Friday and he made no mention of this. I understand from the British Prime Minister that he only heard word of it five minutes before it was announced and that Seamus Mallon only heard about it two minutes before the announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> The Government recognises the need for urgent progress to be made on the implementation of all the outstanding aspects of the Agreement and we expect that all the pro-Agreement parties will work constructively with the two Governments, particularly following the British general election, to overcome all the remaining obstacles.</P>
    <P>I can tell Deputy Noonan that over recent weeks we have made substantial progress. We are working on the policing issue in particular. We are also looking at what we would need to do to extend the decommissioning remit. The British Government has said it is likely to extend the de Chastelain remit to February, at least, but since the 8 March meeting in Hillsborough we have endeavoured to find a way of making as much progress as we possibly can on the various issues, though they are not connected. We will continue that right up to tomorrow morning when the last meeting will take place shortly before the election is called, as is expected, when the officials will no longer be available to us. I hope that progress will leave us in a position to take up these matters after the election but we have learned many times over the past seven or eight years that the process is usually not helped by deadlines, although we were working to try to achieve as much as we could by the end of June. That is still the position of the two Governments and we will continue to do that to the best of our ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the decommissioning regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to take our lead on that matter from General John de Chastelain. Perhaps we will have to move outside the remit of some of the existing issues to extend or alter the schemes. Both Governments indicated that they would favour such a move and I believe the First Minister and Deputy First Minister would also be in favour of it. However, we must wait for a period because we have not yet received a clear signal from General John de Chastelain regarding the change he would require in that remit. We can, therefore, leave it as it stands for a period or wait to see if it can be extended. In my opinion we will be asked to extend it in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the statements that have been made by party leaders in Northern Ireland, does the Taoiseach agree it will be impossible to resolve this issue through cross-party negotiations in that jurisdiction and that, consequently, the onus will devolve to the two sovereign Governments? Will he contact Prime Minister Blair and inquire if the British officials could be allowed to work through the British election campaign in order to continue the satisfactory work they have been doing with Irish officials until now? I know the British Government will remain in office until election day and that it is the precedent that its officials do not <Col N="1182" /> remain involved in negotiations. However, will the Taoiseach request that an exception be made in this instance? Given that, once the election takes place, a new UK Government will be formed on 9 June, that the relevant meeting of the UUP will take place on 23 June and that the deadline set by David Trimble is 30 June, there will be precious little time to resolve this matter in round table negotiations unless the A, B and C plans are put in place by 9 June.</P>

During the past three weeks in particular we made as much progress as possible in terms of seeing what more we can do on the issue of putting arms beyond use while dealing separately with the issue of policing, a number of lesser but important outstanding issues and the difficulties that already exist in the North-South Ministerial Council. The final meeting takes place in the morning. The difficulty is that the key officials who deal with these matters &ndash; they are very close to Prime Minister Blair &ndash; are obliged to resign their positions, leave No. 10 Downing Street and return to party headquarters. They will, therefore, be out of the equation after tomorrow. We will, however, in so far as is possible, remain in contact with them.</P>

      <P>The civil servants of the Northern Ireland Office will continue with their work. However, the key people responsible for driving forward the process in recent years are not civil servants, they are political advisers to Mr. Blair. However, in so far as is possible, we will remain in contact with the civil servants involved. We will then have to resume negotiations immediately after the election. During the course of the election campaign, the Government will remain in contact with Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the UUP and the other parties. We will also remain in contact with the Northern Ireland Office and the Secretary of State's office. We hope to maintain those contacts, even in a limited way, over the next four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated previously on Question Time, this will place an enormous amount of pressure on the system after 10 June. I have already reported to the House that the Prime Minister has a series of meetings arranged for that week and it is unlikely, from the information in my possession, that he will be available until after 15 June. That means that there will be only two or three weeks in which to make progress. The call the First Minister has made will not help the situation. However, we must deal with matters as they stand and try to make as much progress as poss<Col N="1183" /> ible after 9 June. While the Prime Minister will not be available until after 15 June, his officials should be available after 7 or 8 June.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the impact the inter-union dispute involving the ATGWU is having on the services provided by Iarnród Éireann. So far today, all mainline services out of Connolly Station have been cancelled, while DART services are disrupted. This action is significantly disruptive when this Government is investing unprecedented levels of funding in the railway network. Track and signalling are being upgraded, new rolling stock is being acquired and the standard of service for customers at stations is being upgraded. This strike does not have anything to do with pay and conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The average pay is £29,500, without overtime. It is not about low pay or working conditions. It does not have to happen at a time when we are trying to build public confidence in our railways.</P>
      <P>I have had several meetings with the chairman of CIE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in recent days to express my concern about the impact this dispute is having on the travelling public. Specifically yesterday evening, I asked train drivers, who are members of the ATGWU, to respond positively to the request from the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Peter Cassells, to call off their threatened strike action. Mr. Cassells had offered to chair a meeting of unions at Iarnród Éireann today in advance of a formal hearing by the disputes committee of congress into the inter-union difficulties next Thursday. However, I now understand that ICTU has been in touch with all the unions concerned and there are indications that the ATGWU will participate in the ICTU meeting on Thursday. Since this reply was written, that position has changed. The headline on the four o'clock news, which I heard, said it will not participate in the meeting on Thursday. I do not know if that has been further changed. The current action by the ATGWU is unnecessary. This strike is unnecessary and I urge all parties to seek an early resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards direct meetings with ICTU, a meeting was held last Wednesday between the general secretary, the deputy general secretary, the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, the Secretary General of my Department and me. I met Peter Cassells on Friday in Tralee at the communication workers' conference. A meeting was held yesterday afternoon between the officials in my Department, the chairman of CIE, the deputy general secretary of ICTU and the Secretary General of the Department of the <Col N="1187" /> Taoiseach. That was held in two sessions. The first session involved everyone and the second session involved the officials, the chairman of CIE and me. There have been a number of meetings since it became clear that one trade union was determined to disrupt rail services.</P>

        <b>:</b> Despite the fact the Minister mentioned various meetings and initiatives, a key component was missing. Did she receive a letter from the ATGWU dated 19 April in which the union clearly set down its grievances about promises it was given last August if it called off its strike? I am not an advocate for either ILDA or the ATGWU. It was obvious from the letter that we could face serious industrial relations action which has now culminated in the withdrawal of train services today and a further escalation tomorrow and the next day. Why was that letter not acknowledged and dealt with? Why was follow-up action not taken to head off the catastrophe we are now facing, namely, ten or 12 weeks of industrial action and devastation similar to that which happened last summer? </P>

        <b>:</b> One would imagine that given the letter contained serious material about grievances, which are now the subject matter of today's industrial action, some contact would have been made with the union. There has not been any contact with the union, good, bad or indifferent, to try to establish a common ground to broker a deal. I am not an advocate for the union.</P>
      <P>As regards the line being argued by Iarnród Éireann that it is not in a position to negotiate with the ATGWU, is it not a fact that the company is already dealing with the ATGWU in relation to certain sections, for example, craft workers, etc.? It is dealing with the union on one aspect of labour relations, but it will not deal with this group, although ILDA has moved from outside the tent into the tent and is now part of a legally established negotiating body? </P>

      <P>As regards the briefing note I received, that was sent immediately to the section in the Department of the Taoiseach which deals <Col N="1188" /> with disputes appertaining to the PPF. That section dealt immediately with Peter Cassells and has continued to do so, as I have also done. This is an inter-union dispute. There is a mechanism within congress for dealing with such disputes. It is not a matter for Iarnród Éireann to deal with a dispute which has the umbrella of congress to find a resolution. That has been made clear not just by me but by Peter Cassells and others who have spoken on the issue. An open invitation was issued to the union in question to come to talks chaired by a prestigious person, the general secretary of congress, but it was spurned and the needless route of a disruption to the rail service was embraced. The only way to solve this is through the ICTU. The method is laid out in congress procedures and to operate outside those procedures would be wrong. An apology to commuters from me may be seen as of little use but it is necessary for me to do so. I apologise for the fact that this disruptive route has been chosen by the ATGWU. That union is an affiliate member of the ICTU which makes the action very difficult to understand.</P>

      <P>This morning 110,000 passengers were left on platforms because of this dispute. Is the Minister aware of the situation for students, many of whom had returned home to study and must sit exams tomorrow? They will not now be provided with public transport and parents will have to take a day off work to bring them to their exams. What action has been taken to resolve the dispute, which concerns the non-recognition of ILDA and now the ATGWU and which has been ongoing for the past 18 months? Now that there is a proliferation of inter-union disputes, what measures are being taken by Government to ensure these issues can and will be resolved? The situation in Irish Rail, Aer Lingus and numerous other companies show that inter-union disputes are causing major disruption within the transport sector. Why was it only in the past days that the Minister discussed this matter with the ICTU and Irish Rail?</P>

      <P>We had a meeting last Wednesday which is almost one week ago. Prior to that, the section within the Department of the Taoiseach dealing with PPF had taken the matter up with the ICTU. It was not just today or yesterday that the matter was addressed. My Department had a meeting on the matter on Wednesday last, on Friday last and yesterday.</P>
      <P>The dispute is hugely disruptive to the travelling public and is extremely damaging to the trade union movement. Inter-union disputes are doing enormous damage to the public perception of trade unions. There are many fine people in the trade union movement and I am a strong believer in that movement, but not in the disputes which arise among unions. It is unacceptable that the consumer pays the price for rivalries between two unions. The price is paid by the public yet the dispute rumbles on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> The first group which came to my mind when this dispute occurred were students, not just secondary students but also those at third level travelling to and from examinations. They will be severely disrupted. However, it is an inter-union dispute for which there is a formula for resolution within congress. Congress has extended the invitation to the ATGWU and has asked the union to come to talks at which other unions will be represented and at which the issues will be dealt with in the round. The ATGWU has not accepted the invitation so far. A radio programme claimed that the ATGWU would attend talks, but that has been discounted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this is an inter-union dispute about recognition of Mr. Brendan Ogle's maverick group, ILDA, and is not about pay and conditions for workers? I am a paid up member of SIPTU. Will the Minister agree that it is unhelpful to the settlement of this dispute, and has been unhelpful in previous disputes in CIE, for the Minister to go on the national airwaves and say that the matter has nothing to do with her? The Minister's good offices and influence are available and are being used, according to the Minister's account to the House. Why is the public not told this? Does the Minister support the case made by Mr. Peter Cassells, general secretary of the ICTU, asking the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union to call off its dispute and to use the mechanisms officially available within the ICTU for the resolution of disputes? There is a special committee in the ICTU for cases where affiliated unions are in dispute with each other. All sides of the House should call on the ATGWU to accept that invitation from Mr. Cassells to use the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly endorse what Mr. Cassells said on television today, and I endorsed it on Wednesday last, on Friday last and yesterday. That is the correct way to deal with this situation. If we allow the procedures demanded by the ATGWU, not alone will there be total chaos in the rail system but there is likely to be a disruptive effect on industrial relations in other arms of the public sector. Mr. Cassells said that the invitation was extended and I endorse that. The matter has much to do with my Department but I will not and cannot intervene in an industrial dispute between two trade unions. There is a procedure laid down in the ICTU for dealing with such a dispute. The ATGWU is an affiliate member of the ICTU and should accept the invitation to talks rather than cause the disruption which the travelling public suffered today. Deputy Stagg is correct that there is a special committee within congress for dealing with this type of dispute. I agree that the dispute is not about pay and conditions.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a need to persuade the various institutes of education and universities to give a second chance to a number of students who missed important exams due to today's industrial action? Will the Minister use her offices to make the message clear that those who unavoidably missed exams should be accommodated where possible? This has been done in the past. Will the Minister take up the strong recommendation from the Labour Court that everyone should avoid a process where some parties are treated less favourably than others? Will the Minister take steps to respond to the ATGWU on the basis of the letter to which Deputy Jim Higgins referred. Will she ensure that lines of communication are kept open and that she does her utmost to reach out so that there will be industrial peace in the company and so that we can say that the Minister was instrumental in bringing that about?</P>

      <P>On the examinations due to take place today, I will speak to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science whose office, I presume, will be in a position to ascertain how many students were affected. I am aware that examinations in third level institutions &ndash; oral, written etc. &ndash;  commence in May. I was glad to see the fine weather this morning although it has not ameliorated the current problem.</P>
      <P>The Deputy stated that all people should be treated equally and I concur with that. ICTU has clearly stated that this is a matter to be determined under its rules and procedures for dispute resolution. It has outlined that view repeatedly since last Wednesday when the General Secretary of ICTU informed me that he was under the impression, following a meeting with the ATGWU, that the matter was resolved in so far as its representatives were to attend a meeting he was to chair this morning. That plan unravelled by Wednesday night. The general secretary informed me on Friday that the situation had deteriorated much further than he anticipated and, today, he strongly reiterated ICTU's position. It would be incorrect, from a procedural point of view and from the point of view of the future conduct of industrial relations in any company, for one to intervene in what is clearly an inter-union dispute.</P>
      <P>I accept that the dispute will do great damage to the travelling public but, sadly, it will equally damage the regard people have for the trade union movement.</P>

Does she accept it would be inappropriate for her to intervene at all in the management matters of semi-State companies and will she assure the House that she does not do so? Does she further accept that ongoing industrial relations difficulties, as witnessed in CIE in recent times, can always be attributed to bad management?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments on intervention which echoed those of his leader, Deputy Noonan. I hold the firm view that a Minister should only deal with the chairman of any semi-State company which experiences difficulties or faces challenges, not with executives or line managers. The communication channel in regard to the exchange of views and information is between the Minister and company chairman and this has always been the case. The Deputy conducted his business in that way when he was a Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to give an opinion on the Deputy's contention that prolonged or frequent industrial relations difficulties are attributable to bad management as the current problem arises from an inter-union dispute. The information I received last Wednesday, Friday and yesterday was to the effect that if the request of the union in question were acceded to, the other two unions &ndash; SIPTU and the NBRU &ndash; would immediately pull out of all transport operations. This issue could not be easily resolved through my intervention with the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court. I reiterate that the ATGWU is an ICTU affiliate.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the splintering of trade unions is not in the interest of workers, good company management or the public as it gives rise to maverick-type action? While accepting that the right to strike is sacrosanct, does the Minister agree that this action, which affects more than 100,000 people, is totally disproportionate to the grievance which the trade union in question is seeking to resolve? That union is not only affiliated to ICTU but is also affiliated to the Labour Party. I call on ATGWU's Irish branch secretary, Mr. Michael O'Reilly, to accept Mr. Cassell's invitation to attend the meeting of the unions involved and to call off this unnecessary action.</P>

        <b>:</b> I hope the negotiations due to take place on Thursday will proceed although we are unsure about their status. If they do not proceed and a further stand-off occurs, does the Minister accept that, notwithstanding ICTU's dispute resolution mechanisms, a case <Col N="1192" /> could be made for the appointment of a credible mediator, a person with a proven track record, who would be acceptable to all sides? In that way, the unions could sit down together at the negotiating table to hammer out some kind of rational solution to this problem to ensure the dispute is called off as soon as possible. I am thinking of someone like Mr. Phil Flynn who would have the necessary know-how in this area and in whom all parties would have confidence.</P>

The resolution of this issue lies with ICTU and it will urge all sides to co-operate with the proposed resolution which will emanate from Thursday's meetings. The appointment of a mediator would be a matter for ICTU and, while I cannot comment on his potential role in this matter, I endorse the Deputy's comments about Mr. Phil Flynn.</P>

How else does the Minister explain that the company could, under the individual grievance procedure, hear the complaints of the seven workers but is refusing to do so because they are insisting on their right to be accompanied by a union member of their choice? How does she explain the failure of the company to respond to 56 invitations to conciliation from the LRC? The company dismissed the claims as spurious before a hearing has even taken place. It is time people got real about this. Members of SIPTU and the NBRU did not pass the picket today. Train drivers are supporting each other despite the disgraceful attempts of the Labour Party to undermine them here today. What would Jim Larkin say, the founder of the Labour Party who stood for solidarity among ordinary trade unionists and workers? Perhaps we need to talk to the leaders and not the ordinary members of ICTU and other unions who in recent times have been too cosy in bed with Government and employers resulting in them losing many members as happened in the case of Aer Lingus and so on.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short, technical Bill. Its main purpose is to provide, where necessary, for the replacement of Irish pound amounts in law with convenient amounts in euro to apply from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The need for the Bill arises from the fact that under Regulation (EC) No. 974/98, Irish pound amounts in law at the end of 2001 are from then on to be read as amounts in euro, converted at the fixed conversion rate 1 euro = £0.787564 and rounded to the nearest cent. As a result, convenient Irish pound amounts, for example, £10, £100 or £500 will convert to non-convenient amounts in euro or 12.70, 126.97 and 634.87, respectively. Action is therefore required to provide in necessary cases where, for example, amounts are usually paid in cash, for convenient amounts in euro to replace existing Irish pound amounts from the start of next year.</P>
      <P>Much work has been done on this issue already. For example, this year's Finance Act provided for the replacement of Irish pound amounts in the tax code with convenient amounts in euro from 1 January 2002, and the Social Welfare Act did the same for money amounts in the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>The current Bill is aimed essentially at dealing with places elsewhere in law where convenient amounts are necessary. The amounts covered in the Bill have been identified by Departments, following a trawl of their legislation, as needing to be replaced by convenient amounts in euro from 1 January 2002. I stress that the principle on which the move to convenient amounts, where necessary, has been made is that we should favour the citizen in all such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I turn to the specific provisions of the Bill, it is proper to give the House a brief description of the current state of changeover preparations. Euro notes and coins will be introduced into circulation on 1 January 2002. There will then be a short period of about six weeks while the use of euro cash will be increasing and the use of Irish cash will be decreasing. Under our cash changeover plan, published last year, it is intended that legal tender status will be withdrawn from Irish notes and coins at midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002. This period should be long enough to enable people to familiarise them<Col N="1197" /> selves with the new currency and short enough to ensure that the changeover is carried out quickly.</P>
    <P>In March I laid a draft order before both Houses of the Oireachtas to provide for the withdrawal of legal tender status at midnight on 9 February 2002. Deputies will be aware that a resolution approving the order is being taken together with the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Preparations for the changeover to the euro essentially involve six elements, namely, legislation, the production of euro cash, preparations by the public sector, preparations by the private sector, consumer matters and the provision of public information.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with recent legislation. As regards cash production, I am assured by the Central Bank that this is on target. The process will involve 250 million euro notes and over 1,000 million euro coins.</P>
    <P>Departments continue to confirm that progress on implementation of their changeover plans and those of bodies under their aegis are on target. Each Department and body is responsible for the changeover of its own operations, but they must report regularly to my Department.</P>
    <P>Preparations by the private sector are primarily a matter for companies themselves. However, as long ago as 1996, Forfás established a campaign to provide businesses with the information they need to prepare themselves for the changeover. The EMU business awareness campaign has distributed large quantities of information to Irish businesses. Forfás has also involved business extensively in its campaign by means of its consultative committee which includes a wide range of business organisations and its retail group which includes a wide range of retail organisations.</P>
    <P>The Forfás Loughrea euro town project, under the aegis of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, provided excellent case studies of the practical experience of businesses making changeover preparations. More recently, Forfás produced a document entitled Getting Your Retail Businesses Ready for the Euro. Over 150,000 copies of these guidelines have been issued, including one to every retailer in the country.</P>
    <P>Despite the excellent work Forfás has been doing and continues to do and despite the fact that by now every business person in the country must have heard many times that the euro is coming, it is clear that some businesses have still to engage seriously with their changeover preparations. The message for these businesses is simple &ndash; prepare now.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with business preparations, I should mention a recent agreement aimed at facilitating a speedy changeover to euro cash next January. The House will be aware that under the cash changeover plan retailers will give change only in euro from 1 January 2002 and that Irish notes and coins being received inwards will be retained and not issued outwards again. The purpose of these measures is obvious, namely, to ensure that the changeover to euro cash is carried <Col N="1198" /> out as quickly and efficiently as possible. This is particularly in the interests of retailers.</P>
    <P>However, retailers have been concerned that they will have to pay bank handling charges for the euro cash they will need to get in advance of 1 January 2002. They have also been concerned that they will face cash lodgement charges on the Irish cash they will be depositing with their banks during the dual circulation period.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the House that the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and the Central Bank have reached an agreement with the banks whereby banks will not charge cash handling charges on euro cash provided to retailers in advance of 1 January 2002 and will not charge cash lodgement charges on Irish notes and coins lodged by retailers during the dual circulation period and for a short time afterwards, namely, from 1 January 2002 until the end of the week after legal tender status is withdrawn from Irish notes and coins.</P>
    <P>In return for this waiver, the Central Bank will, during the dual circulation period and for a short period afterwards, provide the banks with a lodgement fee for Irish notes and coins it receives from them. The lodgement fee will partly, but only partly, compensate the banks for the fee income they will forgo. The cost is estimated at £5 million to £6 million.</P>
    <P>The banks will shortly be communicating with their retailer customers about their arrangements in relation to this agreement. In addition, they will be giving details of the date next January on which they will debit retailer customers for the euro cash provided to them in advance of 1 January.</P>
    <P>The consumer aspects of the changeover are being addressed by the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and by the Director of Consumer Affairs. They relaunched the national code of practice on the euro changeover last December, with an action plan for consumer protection during the changeover. The House will be aware that a key aspect of the code is that subscribers to it, and any sectoral code approved under it, commit themselves to carrying out the changeover fairly and to seek no advantage from the conversion.</P>
    <P>The final element in the changeover preparations is the provision of public information. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has responsibility in this area and it has been carrying out very extensive public information activities since its establishment in a programme that is part-funded by the EU. Among many other items, the board has sent a leaflet about the euro to every household every year since its establishment; organised widespread circulation of leaflets, posters, booklets and other information materials, including educational material for schools and materials for every teacher; run several advertising campaigns on television and radio and in the press; set up a lo-call helpline and a website, the latter with a special section for schools; and made a train-the-trainers pack <Col N="1199" /> widely available for general use in both the public and voluntary sectors.</P>
    <P>The needs of low-awareness and special needs groups are catered for through the board's consultative panel. Furthermore, the board runs a programme of part-funding for non-governmental organisations carrying out euro information activities, and many of the projects funded under the programme relate to these groups. This programme has been operated by the board since 1998. Its most recent round of funding, which closed in early April, attracted over 150 applications.</P>
    <P>The board is issuing large quantities of information. In April alone, it issued over half a million items of information about the euro. The board is also currently distributing a leaflet on the euro to every household in the country. Public information activities will intensify greatly in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Let me now return to the Bill before the House. As I have said, it is a short, technical Bill. It has been the subject of widespread consultation among interested parties, including those represented on the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. Most of the money amounts covered in the Bill are routine fees and charges in respect of licences, permits etc., which are, or may be, paid in cash. These amounts are being reduced to the nearest convenient amount below the exact euro equivalent, so as to favour the citizen. A typical example, with which Deputies will be familiar, is the deposit for candidates at Dáil elections. This currently stands at £300, which would convert to 380.92 at the conversion rate. However, in the Bill I am providing for the more convenient and easier to remember amount of 375.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a number of thresholds which are being increased to the nearest convenient and memorable euro amounts, again so as to favour the citizen. An example is the £500 threshold for disclosure of gifts under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, which would convert to 634.87. The Bill provides for a convenient amount of 650 in this case.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the replacement of IR£ amounts at specific references in Acts and Statutory Instruments with convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002. It does so by means of general provisions which refer to the Schedules to the Bill. Schedule 1 lists the IR£ amounts being replaced and the euro amounts to replace them in respect of fees and charges while Schedule 2 lists the statutory references at which the replacement will take place. Similarly, Schedule 3 lists the IR£ amounts being replaced and the euro amounts to replace them in respect of thresholds while Schedule 4 lists the statutory references at which the replacement will take place. In all cases only the specific amount appearing at the exact statutory reference will be replaced. Other amounts appearing elsewhere in those Acts will not be affected, but will convert to euro at the conversion rate under the EU regulation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Sections 2 and 3 are technical provisions in support of section 1. They provide respectively for dispensing with consents and for the continuation in force of existing powers to set amounts. They are included for the avoidance of doubt. Section 4 provides for technical amendments to the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998, to align the exact time of the withdrawal of legal tender status from IR£ notes and coins &ndash; intended for midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002 &ndash; with that of the repeal of earlier law under which IR£ notes and coins are issued or under which limits are placed on the number of coins that may be tendered. Due to a wording difference, under the 1998 Act as it currently stands, these repeals would come into effect from the start of the day for withdrawal of legal tender status from IR£ notes and coins, whereas legal tender status itself would continue until the end of the day. The effect of the section is to eliminate this gap. The draft order I have laid before both Houses to withdraw legal tender status has been drawn up on the assumption that the 1998 Act will be amended as provided for in this section. The order will not be made until the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends the Credit Union Act, 1997, in a number of ways with effect from 1 January 2002. First, it redefines a share in a credit union as one euro, in place of one pound, standing to the credit of a member in a share account. It goes on to make a number of consequential changes to amounts dependent on the definition of a share and to substitute convenient amounts in euro for certain minimum and maximum amounts in the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the threshold for declaration of interest by staff of the Heritage Council. The IR£ and euro amounts are already included in Schedule 3, but 1,300 in figures is being substituted for the current &ldquo;one thousand pounds&rdquo; in words in the Heritage Act in line with general drafting practice. Section 7 contains the usual citation provisions.</P>
    <P>I intend to propose a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. One amendment will defer until the next working day the giving of value by banks in respect of transactions that fall due for processing by them on a day when the TARGET interbank settlement system is closed by decision of the European Central Bank. This is similar to what already happens in respect of public holidays. The vast majority of the closed days already correspond with our public holidays. The exceptions are Labour Day on 1 May &ndash; our public holiday is on the first Monday in May &ndash; and 31 December this year when the ECB has decided that TARGET should be closed in order to safeguard the smooth conversion of retail payment systems and internal bank systems to the euro. The ECB has welcomed our intention to introduce this provision.</P>
    <P>Regarding the other amendments, a couple are technical while others merely add a few references that have come to notice recently from Departments and delete a reference that will now <Col N="1201" /> be dealt with otherwise. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to Deputies' contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I support the Bill. We are coming towards the end of the changeover period from the IR£ to the euro. However, our currency was undervalued when the value of the  was set at IR£0.787564. We are stuck with that exchange rate but if it was still a free currency, the value of the IR£ would be higher. This is a significant point because the fact that the settled rate is less than it might otherwise have been means the national wealth has been diminished in relative terms. It is also an inflationary factor.</P>
      <P>I remember the change from pounds, shillings and pence to pounds and pence when 240 old pence per pound became 100p. It meant that the minimum increase in prices thereafter was 1p, which was equivalent to 2.4 old pence. Although some people dispute it, this factor tended to have an inflationary effect. Previously, prices increased occasionally by one old penny, but subsequent increases were by 1p and then 5p, which was equivalent to 12 old pence. There is a great danger that something similar could arise on this occasion, although that should not happen because the value of 1 cent is less than the value of 1p. Therefore, if prices are increased by 1 cent or 5 cents, it will be equivalent to less than 1p or 5p.</P>
      <P>People cannot use the excuse of convenience to introduce inflationary increases. However, every possible step should be taken to clamp down on people who try to exploit the changeover and make a killing at the expense of the consumer, thereby adding to inflation. There is a serious danger in that regard and the Government has not given adequate consideration to it. I am aware that this aspect is a matter for the Minister with responsibility for consumer protection in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I hope he and his Department are fully aware of it and taking every appropriate step.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a 40 day changeover period, which is less than six weeks, and this is much too short. The original proposal was for a changeover period of six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A period of at least three months should be provided because, as it stands, tender will cease to be legal on 9 February after only five and a half weeks. What will happen if people still have large amounts of £5 or £10 notes or coins? Will they lose the value of this money immediately? Will there be a transition period during which sums can be exchanged for new currency? The Minister is aware that money is kept under mattresses in thousands of homes throughout the country, particularly by elderly people. It may be some time before this money is used and it should be possible for people to exchange old <Col N="1202" /> money for new currency in banks within a certain period. Will the Minister comment on this suggestion?</P>
      <P>The period of 40 days provided for in the Bill could cause serious problems because people will not have enough time to get used to the new currency. Items that now cost £1 will cost 1.26. They will appear more expensive and there will also be an opportunity for some people to increase prices. My concern is based on the fear that retailers will decide on new convenient sums at the higher rather than the lower range. That is where the inflationary danger will arise. This issue has not been adequately addressed.</P>
      <P>I am puzzled that the Central Bank is to pay the financial institutions between £5 million and £6 million during the changeover period. The Minister states:</P>
      <P>. . . the Central Bank will, during the dual circulation period and for a short period afterwards, provide the banks with a lodgement fee for Irish notes and coins that it receives from them. The lodgement fee will partly &ndash; but only partly &ndash; compensate the banks for the fee income they forego. The cost is estimated at £5 million to £6 million.</P>
      <P>I understand that banks must be profitable and that they must operate on a commercial basis but we have been badly let down by them in recent years. I do not refer only to the DIRT issue but to the high level of bank deposits in the Isle of Man and elsewhere and the need for these to be examined as a means of tax evasion. I will return to this aspect at a later date.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the banks' total lack of social obligation or awareness of their duty to be good corporate citizens. They have withdrawn from involvement in areas of activity that occur lower down the socio-economic ladder. This has all the hallmarks of a cartel operation between the main banks. For example, when one withdraws from engagement in one area another withdraws from a different area. There is a state of collusion rather than competition between them. There are also worrying signs of bad corporate governorship by the banks and financial institutions.</P>
      <P>It is for these reasons I take exception to the Minister's confirmation that the Central Bank is to pay the banks £5 million to £6 million during the changeover period. That is wrong. It is a cost the banks should bear. They will have much extra business during the changeover. Furthermore, membership of the euro is highly beneficial to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that section 5 will amend the Credit Union Act, 1997. It redefines a share in a credit union as one euro, in place of one pound, standing to the credit of a member in a share account. This could be construed as meaning that members of credit unions will see their shares reduced in value from pounds to euros. Will the Minister clarify this aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> The changeover to the new currency requires painstaking preparation over a long period. It is part of a great project to give much of the EU a single currency. The changeover board has provided much timely and comprehensive information. I hope its efforts are successful and that those businesses and individuals who have not taken sufficient notice of the forthcoming change begin to do so and begin to make the preparations that are so necessary to ensure this transition will be fluent and successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take stock of our position as we commence the third stage of economic and monetary union and address the details involved in the changeover to the new currency. There is virtually no chance of avoiding serious chaos at the start of next year. There is overwhelming evidence that all of the good work of the changeover board is not making any impact. All the surveys demonstrate that the percentage of trade in euros by companies within Ireland is the lowest in Europe and that the proportion of their trade in euros with companies abroad is among the lowest. They also demonstrate that the numbers with cheque books in euros is very small. I doubt if there is an instant solution to this but over the next few months there is a need for those in the House who care about this issue, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the changeover board and all concerned to redouble their efforts and use whatever innovative means are necessary to get the message across. Otherwise we will be in serious trouble at the start of next year.</P>
      <P>This is an unprecedented project. It must be the most ambitious economic project in Europe since the industrial revolution. That it already involves 12 countries is a measure of its success and almost certainly guarantees its future. The euro will rapidly become used in eastern Europe, probably before the countries of the region accede to the formal mechanisms involving the ECB and so on. I visited Latvia 18 months ago and was interested in debating the issue with people involved in the Ministry of Finance. They take the view that the euro will be used by them within a relatively few years whether or not they are part of the ECB structure. As long as they accept the currency as legal tender or businesses use it when engaging in transactions outside their country there is nothing to stop them from proceeding on that basis. In terms of its acceptance throughout Europe the euro is almost certainly a guaranteed success. That was not obvious four or five years ago. It is something with which those of us who supported the project can be pleased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project exists on two different but interlinking levels. It has always had and continues to have a very significant political aspect. It is, at least in part, a political project. It was intended, and will have the effect, of binding together the Continent through binding together business and the interests of citizens in a way which very few <Col N="1204" /> other measures could do. That is hugely important.</P>
    <P>The currency is also necessary to make it possible to complete the Single Market. A currency exchange acts as a barrier to internal trade within a structure such as the EU but it is also a safety valve for under performing economies. That tension has always been there. It was inevitable that a choice would be made sooner or later on removing the barrier or maintaining the safety valve. The inevitable and correct choice was made.</P>
    <P>In joining the eurozone we have sought to become part of a zone of economic stability. That has been largely achieved in the few years since the start of the third phase of economic and monetary union. This year economic growth in the eurozone will be between 2.5% and 3%, depending on the figures to be believed. We are told that is roughly where the sustainable level of non-inflationary growth generally stands within the eurozone and it is something with which we can be happy. The eurozone will have a budget surplus this year, something that would have been virtually unimaginable ten years ago when some countries within the eurozone had what appeared to be incurable and permanent budget deficits. Many countries which do not have a tradition of budgetary stability now have budget surpluses or small deficits and that must be an incontrovertibly good thing. It can be largely ascribed to the euro and the stability pact that underpins it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will forgive me for moving a little from the consensus when I say the European social model is alive and kicking within the eurozone, despite the carping of those who still speak in a negative way about deregulation, structural reform and so forth. I agree with certain comments but I retain a critical eye and approach to many of them.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at what benefits EMU was supposed to bring to Ireland and how much we have benefited so far. One of the major benefits was low and stable interest rates. It is important to state clearly what most of us knew or should have known all along, that internal stability within the eurozone is far more important than exchange rate stability. Ireland is in a unique situation. It is more dependent on exporting to non-eurozone countries than the rest of the eurozone. The bulk of trade carried out by countries within the eurozone is with other countries within that zone. Maintaining control of inflation and internal stability within the eurozone must, therefore, have paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Nobody who looked at the argument which preceded Maastricht could have believed anything different. We should bear that in mind during the current debate on where interest rates should be. The Minister has famously not engaged in this debate and I do not blame him. Not many years ago I was one of those who believed, perhaps naively, that it was possible to have a genuine public debate about these issues and that politicians, including Ministers for Fin<Col N="1205" /> ance, should engage positively in that debate. I believed it was simply part of accountability, given that the bank was an independent bank. I have regrettably come to believe, after a couple of years observing the dynamic of these things and how the markets interpret and overshoot following the most innocuous comments from players, it is not possible to have such a debate in public. That is most unfortunate but it appears to be an inevitable part of how the markets work. I regret that. However, I am not bound in that way so I feel entitled to express my view.</P>
    <P>We cannot be impervious to the argument that a reduction in interest rates would benefit the global economy, specifically the US economy. Ireland, in particular, cannot be unaware of that argument given our dependence on foreign direct investment from the United States. Nonetheless, it is my strong belief that as long as the euro is relatively weak against the dollar the case for reducing the ECB interest rates within the eurozone is not well made or well grounded. The bank might well abandon its current policy in future weeks but I believe it is right to hang on to it for the present.</P>
    <P>We should not return to the days of the Bundesbank when anything resembling an inflationary threat was met with an immediate hike in interest rates or to the attitude that the ECB should be, as the Bundesbank undoubtedly was, completely immune to any thoughts about the need to stimulate or assist growth. We need a bank which has balance and, at present, the ECB has got the balance right. The mandate of the bank, in terms of internal stability and inflation control, is probably about right too.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to reflect about the markets generally, at the risk of giving succour to Deputy Joe Higgins. The events of recent weeks have been fascinating, particularly how the markets reacted to events in the United States where they appear to be screaming for a further reduction in interest rates despite Mr. Greenspan giving them a far greater reduction more quickly than had been anticipated. They are still not satisfied, however, and are unlikely to be satisfied until further reductions are delivered.</P>
    <P>One cannot help thinking that some of this, at least, is being sought to sustain what the markets have already themselves decided are unsustainable asset prices, particularly stock market prices. It is astonishing that the markets can decide that the stock market is too high and can promptly reduce it yet their spokespersons have no difficulty in demanding of public policy makers that they intervene to sustain those unsustainably high asset values. Perhaps that is the way markets work. Markets overshoot, they propagate themselves and are self-centred but they are indispensable in the context of a market economy, which is the reason parties like the Labour Party argue for regulation of institutions to provide a measure of balance.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to look at what has happened to Irish trade. The experience in this coun<Col N="1206" /> try is most informative and has been different from what would have been expected a few years ago. Our assumption was that Ireland would re-orientate its trade even more towards the eurozone, given that it had a fixed exchange rate and, consequently, no exchange rate risk. However, the opposite happened. For most of last year our exports to countries outside the eurozone grew, particularly our exports to the United States. The conclusion to be drawn is fairly simple. The value of the euro and the fact that it is weak <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar has been more important in determining where trade has gone than the fact that we have a fixed exchange rate with the rest of the eurozone.</P>
    <P>So far, that has had a benign effect. Perhaps it simply indicates that we are flexible and that business can take advantage of the &ndash; what I believe to be &ndash; short-term, weakness of the euro but it might also indicate a dependence on the US and the United Kingdom which could be difficult for us if the euro appreciates, as it surely must, and could have consequent effects on our competitiveness. We must re-orientate. Business must be given the message that it should re-orientate within the eurozone, not only because it is safer to do so in the long term but because not to do so would involve a massive loss of opportunity for Irish business, which would be a great pity.</P>
    <P>There was a three year period for eurozone countries to move from fixing the exchange rates to providing the notes and coins. That was intended to give people in business time to familiarise themselves with and get used to the new currency and to adjust their systems. That intent, however, has been little short of a failure. All surveys indicate we are not well prepared and that we have moved in our thinking and preparations less far than any other European country, with the possible exception of Italy. I read in<i> Le Monde</i> last week that, according to a Commission report, only Italy could be said to lag behind Ireland. It listed a raft of areas in which Ireland is deficient both in terms of the arrangements made by the banks and small and large businesses and in the way it has impacted on the consciousness of individuals. We have a real problem and the first thing we must do is appreciate that fact.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with individuals is a basic one. They have got used to the idea that the euro is, in theory, our currency. However, it has the existence of a virtual currency and they seem to imagine that this will continue. They see the changeover not as a switch from the punt to the euro but as the two currencies continuing alongside each other for a longer period than will actually be the case. We need to make it clear that this is not the case and that the punt will disappear and be no more. Many people, particularly older people, have not understood that fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the experience of decimalisation. I do not remember it well because I was just 12 or 13 years old at the time. However, many people are making that comparison but it is a fundamentally false one. Decimalisation was <Col N="1207" /> basically about pennies, 100 pence as opposed to 240 pence. This is about something much more fundamental, namely, the unit of currency, and the cultural shift will be much more important than decimalisation ever was. We need to put that point across, especially to older people.</P>
    <P>I said to the Minister on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill that I had a cultural difficulty in reading the Bill because it set out the tax credit and other provisions exclusively in euros without pound conversions. I then had to amend that. I have had a similar experience since, as I am sure others who have to do this have had, when reading the Central Bank report, for example, which appears to have converted exclusively to euros and does not give the pound equivalent. It is only when we all have such experiences of being confronted with a unit to which we are not accustomed and without a conversion that we will begin to realise it is for real and that we need to think in a different way. Unfortunately, we are a long way from that.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the euro equivalent for various amounts the Government charges and the provision it makes for different items will be rounded to the benefit of consumers. That is right and proper and is right in principle. However, there is a major difficulty to which the Minister alluded. It is not just a question of rounding to the nearest amount but also that rounding will inevitably be to the nearest convenient amount. A lottery ticket costs £1.50 and should be 1.90. It will not stay at that for very long and will become 2 very quickly if it has not already been announced. There is a range of different costs and charges of that variety. I received a bill from Dublin Corporation for the first time for service charges amounting to 120.69. This will still be charged in six or seven months' time and will not remain at that level. It will obviously be rounded up or down to a convenient amount and not just to the nearest 5c or the nearest euro or whatever. The Government needs to give a lead in making clear that, in the next budget, there will be a move to convenient amounts where tax credits and social welfare benefits are concerned rather than just the nearest figure to which they are rounded up.</P>
    <P>I read with interest recently that IBEC urged its members to examine what it euphemistically called its pricing policy. It was referring to the decision of retailers to pitch prices at £9.99, for example, which converts to 12.70. The £9.99 is there for a reason. It is just short of £10 and gives an impression of being a little cheaper. That advantage does not attach to the euro equivalent and it is likely when reviewing pricing policy that many retailers will round up.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a friend who is a doctor who always felt and certainly said to me that the call-out charge of £25 for his private patients was not great. This will be a little more than 31 and I know, because he told me, that he will use the opportunity to increase the charge to 35. This <Col N="1208" /> increase in prices by the back door will happen wholesale unless we take specific measures to ensure it does not happen.</P>
    <P>I know the Euro Changeover Board and those in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment who are involved will say we will have dual pricing and that people will be able to see on 1 January if prices increase. I know they will say competition should keep prices down and that there is a responsibility on us all to keep an eye on prices to ensure they do not increase in the first few weeks of January next. However, I do not believe it will work. If retailers are allowed to do it, there will be a significant amount of rounding up unless we take measures to ensure it does not happen. The Government should examine the possibility of giving the Director of Consumer Affairs additional powers to ensure this does not happen. If that entails something approximating to price control or a price freeze for the first three to six months of next year, we should go that far. The credibility of this process is very important and it is something on which it is a little short.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the Irish Wheelchair Association addressed by the Euro Changeover Board and others and the cynicism of the public was palpable. They are determined they will be ripped off and nothing I nor the Minister could say will persuade them otherwise. Notwithstanding that that type of cynicism is something to which, unfortunately, we have had to become accustomed, they have some basis for that cynicism. We must ensure prices are not increased in the manner I have outlined and, if that involves giving additional powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs, then they must be given.</P>
    <P>The message is not being put across and the only way it can be is by our taking certain measures which we have not envisaged taking heretofore and which will oblige people to take cognisance of the fact the euro is around the corner. The Government and banks have a specific role to play in this. The commercial banks, certainly in the case of AIB with which I bank and, I presume, in other cases, give customer account statements in both pounds and euros in separate columns on the same page. They should consider switching earlier to euro figures rather than maintaining the dual statement for some months into next year. They should consider changing over in October or November of this year. It would make people look twice at their statements and try to make sense of them. It would be a benign way of shocking people into taking account of the fact that this will happen and that the pound equivalent will disappear quickly. Without such measures, people will not pay any attention to it.</P>
    <P>Banks should also give a choice to their business customers, from the smallest retailer to the largest, as to whether they want their next chequebooks in euros or pounds. The banks should pro-actively push the idea of giving people euro chequebooks. We have issued very few and that reflects in the amount of business conducted <Col N="1209" /> in euros. Banks have a role to play in pushing the process further, and I would like to see the number of euro chequebooks in circulation increasing dramatically this side of summer, if possible.</P>
    <P>There is also a role for public bodies who, presumably, can be trusted not to use the process of changeover to increase prices. There is a role for them in pricing exclusively in euros as quickly as possible. For example, we could ask An Post to begin billing people in euros for their television licences. There are a number of other measures which could be taken to make people face the fact that this is something which will happen soon.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, in his reply, to say something about the implications of the changeover for the system of Government and the manner in which his Department and other Departments which interface with the public more regularly will deal with it. I was struck, when reading the budget day report, by the claims of both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that it will take them months to effect the changeover. I want to know why. Is this a change in software or systems? Does it mean printing more books with the euro amounts on them? What is it? Why will it take so long? What is the process that will be undergone?</P>
    <P>There are two other questions to which the Minister might like to respond when summing up. How are we fixed regarding ATMs? I hope most of them will convert immediately on 1 January next to the use of euros, but perhaps the Minister will confirm that is the case and indicate the percentage of ATMs which will change over. Will he indicate whether other machines routinely operated using coins or notes will be changed over and if any difficulty is expected? Six months ago the operators of machines which use coins were concerned that they might not have sufficient time to change over. Has the Minister had contact with their representative organisation and does he expect, when we go to pay a car parking fee on 1 January next that the machine will be capable of accepting euro coins and notes?</P>
    <P>I support this process, both at a political and economic level but I am concerned that the changeover will not be as smooth as we would like. I am aware that the changeover board has produced much material and has gone to great pains to make that material as accessible as possilbe. I assume that process will accelerate rather than decelerate over the next few months. However, I am concerned that it is not being made clear that what will happen on 1 January next is far more serious than decimalisation or Y2K, and will be with us for much longer. It behoves those of us who have a role in telling people about the changeover to do so between now and 1 January 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill. This topic has been discussed on several occasions in the House in the past two <Col N="1210" /> or three years. When the matter was introduced many of us questioned the need for such a long transition period. However, time flies and the prospect of the changeover is now upon us. Within a matter of months the Irish pound will be replaced by the euro.</P>
      <P>People have a clear and simple understanding of what will happen on 1 January 2001. When bank business resumes after the New Year holiday withdrawals from accounts will be in euro and ATM machines will dispense in euro notes only. Will the 50 euro or 100 euro note be the largest to be dispensed from ATM machines? We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of £50 notes in circulation in the last year. This results from their widespread availability from ATM machines. The 50 euro note will be a smaller denomination and I wonder if ATM machines will dispense 100 euro notes. This will be quite an increase in the amount of currency which can be handed out in a single note from an ATM machine. Wages, salaries, pensions and social welfare payments will also be in euro from that day. The first day of 2002 will be an interesting one. It will be the start of a new tax year and a new social welfare year and the beginning of a new currency. It will take a few days for people to become used to the new currency. I advise older people to ask their children to explain the changeover, just as we now ask the youngest rather than the oldest member of the family how to use the video recorder. Children are being very well taught about the new currency in school and will be well equipped to tell their parents and grandparents about the exchange rate.</P>
      <P>On 1 January retailers will charge in euro only. It will be quite a surprise to people to pay for goods in Irish pounds and be given their change in euro. Retailers will then take the old currency to the bank and it will never be seen again. Banks, building societies, post offices and credit unions will exchange up to £500 per person in Irish cash for euro, free of charge and will continue to accept Irish cash in their customer lodgments until 9 February, the end of the dual circulation period. We will have six weeks of frenetic activity.</P>
      <P>I am an optimist and I tend to believe everything will be all right on the night. Some Members have expressed the fear that individuals and businesses are not ready, but, as has happened in many other situations, we will cope with the changeover when it happens. We will not cope a minute beforehand but we will rise to the situation on the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changeover is essential because so much of our trade is with countries within the euro currency area. Some people have made the mistake of thinking the changeover will cause difficulties in cross-Border trade. We already have two currencies in Ireland and that situation will remain unchanged after 1 January next. We already cope with two currencies and the introduction of the <Col N="1211" /> euro will make no difference to cross-Border trade.</P>
    <P>The dual circulation period is welcome and I am pleased it is short. Within two weeks 85% of the new currency will have worked its way into the system and people will soon realise the need to change any cash in hand into euro. If people find they have Irish currency in their homes after 9 February 2002 will they be obliged to go to a bank? I understand that retailers will not accept old currency after that date.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Euro Changeover Board on the large amount of explanatory literature it has produced. If people do not understand the new currency it is not the fault of the board. However, I wonder why so much emphasis has been placed on the equivalence of £1 to 1.27 euro. The public has not grasped the fact that 1 euro is worth 79p. Perhaps it has been decided that it is enough for us to grasp one idea at a time.</P>
    <P>What will the cost of the changeover be to the Exchequer? What will the cost be to the Central Bank and how will it compare with the cost in other countries. Is our Central Bank efficient compared with the central banks of other countries?</P>
    <P>The clearing banks will have contractual arrangements with the Central Bank to deal with the changeover. It is my understanding that the Exchequer will fund the changeover. Much work will be done in banks during the change-over period. They will have their own internal change-over costs and will have a separate cost for the work they do on behalf of the nation in taking the old and distributing the new currencies. There must be no crossover between the costs of the two procedures. Banks must fund their own internal costs as all other businesses do. They must not use their special position to include normal banking costs with the overall costs of the currency changeover. No other organisation will be in a position to do this and I hope banks will not do so either. The Minister has mentioned the cost of counting the dual currencies during the changeover period but I am sure that is a very small part of the changeover cost.</P>
    <P>I read in today's newspaper that the Central Bank is inviting tenders from people to collect old coins to be transported abroad to be minted down because we do not have a mint in Ireland. What will happen to the old notes? Will they be shredded or incinerated? I hope they will not be transported by train so that some latter day Ronald Biggs can head to Brazil for another 60 years and we will be forced to extradite him.</P>

      <P>That is very good, once they are put to good use. People will be curious to know what precisely will happen to these hundreds of millions of Irish banknotes. The same article <Col N="1212" /> mentioned that we will have an additional problem of forgery. It is a problem that we have never really had up to now, although there has always been an element of small-scale forgery. Because the country is small and our currency is not internationally known, there never was an effort by major international criminal groups to forge Irish banknotes. As part of the euro zone, however, we will come under increasing pressure from forgers across Europe, and European central banks will have to address the matter. The coins are different and specific to each country but the notes will be the same.</P>
      <P>We will have to watch inflationary trends, including the rounding up of prices. Deputy McDowell said it was a separate issue but some people will take advantage of the changeover. The oil crisis which spurred high inflation, occurred around the same time as decimalisation so people associated one with the other, although they were caused, substantially, for different reasons.</P>
      <P>A pint of milk may rise to 90 cents but we must remember that pensions will be increasing also. We have all talked about having a weekly £100 old age pension and, hopefully, next year we will have an old age pension of at least 150 euros.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this legislation. The Euro Changeover Board has done tremendous work. From next autumn and into 2002, the Director of Consumer Affairs will have to be given greater resources to monitor price changes. Everybody knows that all business operators will be affected. We are talking about people who are in the business of making money and if there is an opportunity to make an extra few bob they will use it. Therefore, prices will have to be policed in the change-over period. The euro is long overdue and is very welcome. I look forward to the day when Britain decides to join the euro zone so that the anomaly caused by having two different currencies on this island can be eliminated. It is a matter for Britain to decide but I hope that in a few years it will join the euro when they are satisfied that it is working well. When that happens there will be greater currency stability because the vast majority of our trade will then be within the euro zone, including the United Kingdom. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak in support of the legislation. The departure from the old currency is an historic occasion. It will be the third time that we have made such a major change: first, with the introduction of decimalisation, second, in breaking the link with sterling, and now with the introduction of the euro. We have become accustomed to such changes. I do not recall any debate from the time when we introduced our own currency as to whether prices were rounded up, down or side<Col N="1213" /> ways. My only memory of dealings with our neighbours in the UK is that we always seemed to have had a lower value currency for some unknown reason. That made life difficult for importers and others buying goods from Britain.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important for many reasons. It opens up a whole new era in which European unity will be copper-fastened by having a common currency. Although there are a couple of exceptions at this stage, it is to be hoped that those countries still remaining on the sidelines will come on board quickly. That will be important for the success of the euro.</P>
      <P>Napoleon was the first person to come up with the notion of a European single currency, although he had a different way of going about achieving it. Fortunately, his ways were not pursued. The concept of a single currency has been there for quite a long time and it is fundamental to the workings of the European project.</P>
      <P>Much store has been set by the degree to which inflation rose as a result of decimalisation but I am not sure that is correct. Take the example of shopping over the past 12 months. This is not a political point. I am just talking about checking prices over that period during which there has been a fair amount of price inflation here and there. Yet, there has been no currency change-over in that time. I presume that if the change-over had taken place on 1 January 2001, inflation would have been attributed to that, whereas in fact it did not cause it. Inflation is an ongoing process that takes place all the time. I mean no disrespect to the medical profession, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I was very interested to hear that particular part of the debate. It is simply a fact of life that such changes take place in the normal course of events and they are not unique. There is always a danger that we would stop short and say this is attributable directly to the change-over, when it is as a result of something totally different. For example, cost fluctuations for businesses may necessitate price increases at a particular time.</P>
      <P>My only quibble with the proposal is that the euro should have been introduced on 1 January this year for a variety of reasons. I said that a couple of years ago. It was hoped that a number of countries would come on board if some delay in introducing the euro was exercised. That is fine except that it did not work and because it did not work it raised question marks which is the case with anything that continues for too long. Once we procrastinate on issues such as European enlargement there will be a tendency to lose the impetus and impact. It would have been much more effective if the euro had been introduced on 1 January 2001 and it would have been as easy to do it then as one year later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Euro Changeover Board is to be congratulated on the work it has done so far. The Minister, his Department, and those associated with it have done a tremendous job. They have created an awareness of the impending change by encouraging dual pricing. Such a move is not evident in <Col N="1214" /> the United Kingdom. Although the UK financial services sector is aware of the issue other areas are not, even though the UK will have to introduce dual pricing on 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>The point was raised as to how the changeover will affect our trade with Northern Ireland. There is no doubt that it would be much better if we had a common currency throughout the island of Ireland. The sooner the UK joins the euro zone the better for everybody inside the zone, as well as for the UK itself. I see no reason for harking back to the past and attempting to opt out. There are people who say, &ldquo;the old ways were so nice. The old currency was different; you had the feel of it in your hand and you were accustomed to it&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was grand if one had enough of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. That is the point; we never had enough of it. It was so elusive, it escaped us all the time. There were good times but we experienced some hard times, also. Let us hope that this new era will open up something of real importance to the people and to the economy. Somebody once explained it to me as follows: in the 1960s the United States had the same standard of living that we reached in the late 1990s. That puts the matter in perspective, although it is a serious matter to think that a progressive European country could find itself being compared in that fashion. We now recognise that we have come into a new era and have played our part in every aspect of European development, expansion and integration, including financial services and the business sector generally.</P>
      <P>It is of critical importance that everybody recognises the beneficial impact of Ireland's integration into Europe and all that entails. People will hark back to the good old days, but that is a sad reflection on what happened for 150 years during which we exported our people and imported consumer goods. Our people left through no fault of ours. They did not want to leave nor did we want them to but we could not keep them here. However, circumstances have changed primarily as a result of our membership of the EU and our involvement in the European project. It is essential that the benefits Ireland has accrued and will continue to accrue from EU membership are recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people will say it was nicer in the old days because there were fewer people. What did they expect when huge numbers of people had left? There were many wide, open spaces and there was nothing but grand, wild countryside as far the eye could see. To this day along the west coast where I was born there are remnants of houses on the hill sides which belonged to people who gradually, inexorably were forced to leave as a result of economic misfortune. That was the case for approximately 150 years. I do not know whether we fully appreciate and recognise what <Col N="1215" /> has been opened for us as a result of European involvement.</P>
    <P>Continental Europeans will say Ireland has benefited significantly from direct payments by the EU. That is true and Governments of all persuasions put the money to good use and set an example for all other member states and aspiring member states. Nobody can gainsay our success and the use that was made of EU payments. The greatest contributory factor to our success in the EU has been access to the wider market within the EU. We are keeping our people at home instead of exporting them. We are now producing and exporting consumer goods.</P>
    <P>Some people think it would be grand to revert to the old days and the old ways to which we had become accustomed. Letters were sent from America and the UK and they were very important because more often than not they contained money from another economy. We should be glad we have moved away from those days. What we do with our future is entirely in our hands.</P>
    <P>With regard to the euro changeover and everything else associated with our economic development I hope we do not get greedy and become complacent. Everything can change and the degree to which we are committed to the concept of European integration is the degree to which we will achieve success in that area.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt we must compete with everybody else and as long as we compete successfully our economy will continue to thrive and full employment will be maintained well into the future. I do not accept the notion that our economic development is a short-term phenomenon. It can continue for the next 30 years uninterrupted given our economic development. The industrial revolution passed Ireland by because the country was not seen as a good investment prospect but things have changed now.</P>
    <P>The euro will pull together all the strands within Europe but that will not be an easy task. The notion of a single currency has been contemplated previously and has been worked on repeatedly. If everybody pulls together the rewards will be hugely beneficial to the economy.</P>
    <P>The euro changeover will have less of an impact on the economy than had decimalisation. It will impact positively because there is a major difference between the two conversions as a result of the time that has gone into Euro Changeover Board's efforts to make the public aware of what is likely to happen. The only danger is that people assume the date is so far in the future it will not affect them and an event such as the euro changeover may catch them unawares. However, the board will undertake the necessary campaign to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Every price increase was attributed to the advent of decimalisation. Many people spent weeks figuring out what the new price of a product would be when the conversion took place and then decided they were due an increase and <Col N="1216" /> slipped it in because if they did not they would have had to wait six months or a year for it or would not have been able to impose an increase at all. It was unfortunate that happened but the increase in inflation that followed directly as a result of rounding up was not as great as some people said and it would have occurred in any event.</P>
    <P>People who shop regularly say there has been a dramatic mark up in prices over the past 18 months but the euro changeover has not taken place yet. If it had, the increase in prices could not be attributed to it. However, the changeover will be used by those who have negative notions about European integration and European services generally and we need to keep a close eye on that type of attitude. Freedom of speech is a right and everyone is entitled to make his own case. The people who wish to denigrate the concept of European integration will seize any opportunity. I do not blame them for that but they should not be allowed damage the concept of a single currency which will be hugely beneficial to Europeans in general and Ireland in particular.</P>
    <P>The single currency has been contemplated and agonised over for long enough. However, it would have been better to introduce the currency at the beginning of this year rather than next year. I hope when the time comes the Irish business sector will avail of the opportunity presented to it to enhance its prospects and, thereby, improve the economy further.</P>

      <P>Of all those who die in Ireland aged under 65, one third die from cancer. We have the third highest death rate from cancer in Europe and many of those who die are awaiting so-called elective treatment.</P>
      <P>The Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Children informed us in his 1999 annual report that one third of all cancers are preventable, and one third are potentially curable. He also stated that good palliative care can provide significant improvements in quality of life.</P>
      <P>The appalling reality is that in a society awash with money, this Government has failed to give the priority to cancer services which could see more people survive cancer and enjoy many more years with their loved ones.</P>
      <P>At the launch of Daffodil Day last year, a consultant radiotherapist at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin painted a very unacceptable picture regarding the availability of radiotherapy services in Ireland. He pointed out that, on average, only 16% of cancer patients are receiving radiotherapy despite the fact that up to 50% of patients could benefit from it. It was pointed out that up to 1,000 people are dying because of inadequate treatment. Whereas 16% of Irish cancer patients receive radiotherapy, an average of 66% of patients receive such treatment in the EU.</P>
      <P>An eminent oncologist, Dr. John Crown, writing in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> in February last, stated:</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Strategy which emerged . . . undoubtedly led to service improvements. However, by the time the civil servants were finished with it, it contained some awful clangers, principally its total failure to address the hopelessly fractioned Dublin set-up, and its determination that Galway would become the world's only radiotherapy-less comprehensive cancer centre.</P>
      <P>He continued: &ldquo;In truth, what was the worst cancer treatment system in Europe is better, but is still the worst cancer treatment system in Europe&rdquo;. They are his words, not mine.</P>
      <P>The verdict of professionals such as these, and the fact that two major hospitals in Dublin recently confirmed that they had to postpone potentially life saving treatments for cancer patients to make way for non-cancer emergency admissions at a time of unprecedented wealth, huge budget surpluses and unprecedented amounts of taxpayers' money being made available by Dáil Éireann to the Minister for Health and Children, give rise to the concerns expressed in the motion before the House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One mother who needed chemotherapy for a cancerous lump on her neck said recently she had her life saving treatment cancelled each day for almost two weeks. She is reported as saying that the stress was so great, she telephoned twice daily but every day the queue was getting longer. The Minister is quoted as describing these developments as &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;, as if he were some<Col N="1218" /> how a disinterested and unconnected commentator. We have all of this despite the launching of a National Strategy on Cancer in 1996 and an implementation strategy announced in 1997.</P>
    <P>The effect of cancer on society in Ireland is now devastating. One third of all deaths in those aged under 65 means that, on average, 7,500 persons per year die from cancer in Ireland. This constitutes one quarter of all deaths every year and this figure has remained at that level for almost ten years. In 1995, the numbers of persons dying from ischaemic heart disease was 7,926 and this figure declined in 1999 to 6,876. There was no such decline in cancer deaths in the same period.</P>
    <P>An average of 18,000 new cases of cancer are recorded annually in Ireland and on the basis of epidemiological data available, there are regional disparities in both the death rate and incidence, that is, the new cases of cancer, even after taking differences of age profile into account. Death rates from cancer are significantly higher in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area than in the rest of the country. Death rates from cancer are significantly lower in the Southern, Western and North-Western Health Board areas. Death rates for the major types of cancer show statistically significant variation between regions but that has not given rise to strategies to combat those variations.</P>
    <P>There are about 1.3 million new cases of cancer every year in the European Union and more than 840,000 deaths from the disease in Europe. The number of new cases each year is rising and it is anticipated that overall mortality rate in the EU will increase significantly up to 2010 in the absence of effective strategies for prevention and treatment. Ireland's mortality rate from cancer compares unfavourably with that of the EU average. While our death rate from cancer has declined by almost 10% in the under 65 age group since 1970, it is still above the EU average and our mortality rate for the overall population, that is, including those aged over 65, has been rising significantly since the late 1970s.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence that lifestyle and environmental factors play an important role. It is estimated that tobacco, alcohol and diet, the three major lifestyle risk factors, contribute to two thirds of all cancers in Europe.</P>
    <P>More than 6,000 deaths each year in Ireland from cancer and other diseases are directly attributable to smoking. Smoking is a major causative factor in almost 90% of the 1,500 deaths from lung cancer which occur each year. Smoking is also a risk factor in cancers of the mouth, head and neck, throat, oesophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidneys and cervix. An increasing proportion of cancer deaths among women is due to lung cancer. Passive smoking is now recognised as a proven lung carcinogen in humans.</P>
    <P>There is substantial evidence of an increase in cancer risk to the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, larynx and stomach due to regular alcohol consumption. The combined consumption of tobacco and alcohol considerably increases the risk of <Col N="1219" /> upper respiratory and alimentary tract cancer by a factor of ten to 100 in heavy smokers and drinkers. While the percentage of smokers in the Irish population has fallen from 43% in the 1970s to around 27% today, the figure is much higher within certain sub-groups of the population.</P>
    <P>In the National Cancer Strategy it is stated that &ldquo;Ireland will continue to press for an EU-wide approach to banning of advertising of tobacco products&rdquo;. This is the same EU which cannot agree to vote for the banning of tobacco advertising at the World Health Organisation. Despite the fact that Richard Peto's research, Mortalities from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000, shows that the estimated numbers of deaths from smoking as a percentage of total deaths in EU countries in 1995 is as follows: Austria, 12%; Belgium, 16%; Denmark, 21%; Finland, 10%; France, 12%; Germany, 13%; Greece, 13%; Ireland, 20%; Italy, 16%; Luxembourg, 15%; Netherlands, 19%; Portugal, 8%; Spain, 14%; Sweden, 8%; and the United Kingdom, 21%, what has Ireland's Minister for Health done to reverse the obscenity of disagreement within the European Union on support for World Health Organisation initiatives?</P>
    <P>One in ten people will develop skin cancer at some point in their lives and there is evidence to suggest that this figure continues to rise at a rate of 4% per annum. Why, with all this dreadful evidence, is the United States, not Europe, and certainly not Ireland, the best place to receive treatment for breast cancer? Why do we not yet have a national high quality screening programme matched by an equally high quality arrangement for women with symptomatic breast disease? At present, breast screening refers to the investigation by mammography of women who have no symptoms, that is, those who believe themselves to be free of disease, whereas symptomatic patients are women who have a breast complaint and fear that they may have cancer. Why do we not have high quality services for both, given that breast cancer is the second highest cancer killer of women in Ireland?</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of the BreastCheck screening programme and encourage all the women invited for screening to take up the offer. I regret that the screening service is not available nationwide. I also regret that the medical manpower and infrastructure is as yet unavailable to extend the BreastCheck service.</P>
    <P>Despite this welcome development, are we not in danger of being dazzled by the success of the new screening scheme and missing the gross inadequacy of investment in the current service for symptomatic breast disease? Women who present for breast screening under BreastCheck are rightly guaranteed timeframes within which they will receive treatment should they require it. Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff at breast disease clinics in many of our major hospitals, women who already have breast disease symptoms can receive no such service <Col N="1220" /> guarantees. The BreastCheck service shows what can be done with proper resources. The long queues at the out-patient clinics of the under-resourced breast clinics of major hospitals tell a different tale. This under-resourcing is a scandal which could cost lives.</P>
    <P>The professor of surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, Dr. Niall O'Higgins, informed a conference on women and cancer in Dublin that 43% of Irish women who develop breast cancer will die compared with an EU average of 37%. It should be noted that some EU countries have a breast cancer mortality rate of less than 30%. Still, the Minister has not bitten the bullet on the need for rationalisation of breast cancer services.</P>

      <P>The real problem is that this Minister has no plan. Everything is done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. There are so many advisory groups, steering committees, reviews, commissions and inquiries under this Minister that a parliamentary question put down to him on 27 March last inquiring about the number of such bodies and their terms of reference has not yet been answered, though we are now in the month of May. Most questions of this kind are answered in three sitting days. I suspect the Minister does not want to answer the question because he is embarrassed about the number of reviews which are ongoing and the number of matters he has submitted to committees at the drop of a hat instead of taking strategic decisions about the running of the health service.</P>

      <P>The Government launches reports, initiatives and studies with great fanfares, but where is the follow through? For example, in the Building Healthier Hearts document endorsed by the Government it was proposed that tobacco be removed from the consumer price index to avoid the situation where increases in the price of cigarettes, necessary from a public health point of view, are vetoed because of their potential impact on the inflation figures. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, advocates this change but his colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach veto it. So much for discouraging smoking. Instead of real action we have sponsorship of snooker tournaments out of Department of Health funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only does the Minister not have a plan for the health service into which a cancer policy would dovetail, he has presided over an Irish health care system which spends well below the <Col N="1221" /> EU average. In 1980 Ireland spent 8.7% of GDP on health. By 2000 its spend had dropped to 5.1% of GDP, 6.05% on a GNP basis which is probably a fairer measure. Ireland is 22nd in a list of 29 OECD countries in terms of health spending. From a low base in the early 1990s, health spending has more than doubled but it remains far behind the European average of over 8% of GDP.</P>
    <P>Of course those who can pay for themselves suffer less. The percentage of the population covered by private health insurance has more than doubled in the past 20 years with almost 45% of the population now covered by private insurance. However, as the ESRI research for Irish men aged 55 to 64 points out, the poor die younger. Higher professionals have a death rate of 13 per 1,000 for semi-skilled this rose to 22 per 1,000 and for unskilled manual groups to 32 per 1,000, that is, the mortality rate was almost three times higher among lower income groups than better paid professional groups.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has published comprehensive health policy proposals, including extensive proposals for preventative care and health checks so as to tackle the horrors of cancer and similar serious illnesses. The Minister now pretends he will publish a policy after a hurried six to eight week consultation period and that he will do this in July next, that is, it will be published in this Government's fifth year in office.</P>
    <P>Who can take the Minister seriously? He has abused the trust placed in him by this House by consistently appointing large numbers of people from his bailiwick to sensitive health positions. This included appointments to the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, a most sensitive service. He has refused to answer questions in this House and released the information outside the House in a controlled and distorted way, a gross discourtesy to Parliament. Worse than that, he has refused to answer a question put down to him on 27 March inquiring about the precise numbers of advisory groups he has established. According to an independent report the Minister left the managerial system in the Department of Education and Science in a total mess but managed to come out smelling of roses. His <i>ad hoc</i> sticking plaster approach to the health service and his manipulation of the media with daily leaks and reactive announcements is typical of a style which will do little to strategically reorient the health services in general and to tackle specific issues such as cancer in particular.</P>
    <P>I have set out my proposals for health reform and I challenge the Minister to say why he has not set out his. I would go further, however, particularly in relation to cancer and cancer related issues. Mortalities from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000, from which I already quoted, states that an estimated 20% of deaths, that is, 5,881, in 1995 in Ireland were due to smoking. In the United States, the tobacco industry settled with the individual states for a total amount of $347 billion. This money is to be <Col N="1222" /> paid to the individual states simply to compensate them for the cost of the health services used in treating those who have suffered cancer and other related diseases from smoking tobacco. Individuals seeking compensation are now taking class actions. The US has a population of approximately 250 million people while Ireland has a population of approximately 4 million. Ireland should, therefore, receive compensation of the order of $6 billion from the same companies. Legal advice I have received indicates that this level of payment can be obtained from the tobacco industry if the Government follows on the US precedent. Why should we not do this? Should not the Government pursue the tobacco industry and use the money recovered from them in a ring-fenced fund to help give Ireland the best cancer treatment system in Europe?</P>
    <P>Given the relationship between smoking, alcohol and cancer is it not time to ban the advertising of alcohol? Why is Guinness, for example, allowed to continue to sponsor the national game of hurling? Why, given the relationship between smoking and drinking and cancer, and the proven connection of lung carcinogen in humans from passive smoking, has the Government not moved to ban smoking in most parts of public houses? Should those who wish to smoke and drink be confined to a small part of a public house? I believe there is a case for doing this. Why do we not compel public houses to have proper and adequate air extraction and renewal systems? Is it not time we had a health ombudsman to whom the citizen, particularly the poor citizen, can go to defend his or her rights when he or she is treated to such an appalling health service and when life saving treatments, such as for those who suffer from cancer, are, without precedent, withdrawn?</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is time we gave consideration to the appointment of a surgeon general. The chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children does well, but he suffers from being an officer of a Department. The Comptroller and Auditor General is effective because he is appointed by and answers to Dáil Éireann. A surgeon general who would report directly to the Dáil and who is appointed by the Dáil could give us an independent overall view of the health service and its constituent parts, such as cancer treatment. He or she would force us to give this issue the attention it deserves. We have the resources and we must now have the courage and the commitment. Regrettably, I do not see any evidence of this from the Minister.</P>
    <P>People in Ireland will collectively live 13 million years less than a comparable population of just under four million people in France. Why? It is time for a more professional approach to the management of our health services and to health strategy. The religious orders and medical people of the past gave us excellent service. Much of their dedication kept the services together. Furthermore, in times gone by we spent approximately 8% of GNP on the medical services which <Col N="1223" /> meant we were spending figures comparable to those of the EU average. However, those who gave generously of themselves in the past did not have or pass on the type of professional and managerial skills which a modern medical service needs today. Nothing short of a major reform of the strategic leadership and management of the medical services will bring about the type of change we need. Why should we not aspire to live as long as French people, for example? Why should we not live longer? Why should we not live healthier and longer lives? Why should the poor die younger? Should they not also live longer and healthier lives? If we are to do this, we must abandon the <i>ad hoc </i>behaviour and the downright mischievous political meddling with the health services of the nation which are the hallmark of the Minister's administration. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to second this motion. Cancer is a disease we all dread. It is the plague of the 20th and 21st centuries and it is the tuberculosis of earlier generations. Everything possible must be done to defeat the curse of this disease. Extensive expenditure in research is required and maximum use of available cures and treatment controls must be made. Sufferers must not be spared treatment. Counselling services must be made available for those who suffer and for the families of patients. The Minister's efforts are severely lacking in all these areas. There is an immediate need to inject urgency into the service. A person suffering from cancer should not have to wait one minute longer than necessary for treatment. The most up-to-date treatment method must be made available. The deliverers of the service must be facilitated to keep them fully abreast of all new procedures and treatments for the disease. However, that is not happening.</P>
      <P>This disease accounts for approximately one third of all deaths in those aged under 65. This means cancer is the cause of approximately 7,500 deaths in Ireland each year. Every year, an average of 18,000 new cases of cancer are recorded in Ireland and each year there are approximately 50,000 hospital cases of cancer. Ireland has a higher mortality rate from cancer than the average for other EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable and a scandal that people who suffer from the dreaded disease of cancer do not have adequate treatment facilities. No one should have to accept the excuse that the problem of bed shortages in the public hospital sector is so acute it is forcing cancellations of such services as chemotherapy for cancer patients. It is a nightmare for a person to be informed that he or she suffers from cancer. It is then frustrating, frightening, annoying and unfair if the patient cannot get treatment when he or she needs it. All doctors agree that time is of the essence when it comes to the treatment of cancer. A patient has a better chance of being cured if the condition is diag<Col N="1224" /> nosed early and the treatment is delivered at the appropriate time. There cannot be any excuse or reason for delaying treatment in such circumstances. The Minister and the Government stand indicted for doing so.</P>
    <P>Approximately 20,000 people in Ireland are diagnosed with cancer annually. There is an urgent need for these people to obtain full and timely treatment. Experts believe that at the present level of service improvements it will take more than five, and perhaps ten years, before the service can cope. By that stage demographics will mean that the demand for cancer services will be significantly higher. In the meantime there are many surgeons and drugs and money to buy them, but there are not enough beds, radiotherapy units or personnel and there is a scarcity of nurses. There are too few specialists concentrating on one type of cancer, long waiting lists in some hospitals and few, if any, support services.</P>
    <P>As we debate this issue, there are people who need to be treated as a matter of urgency. They need to have their treatment on schedule as that is their best chance of cure. The problem with beds has been there for a long time. Inadequate planning by the Minister and his Department to ensure this difficulty is overcome has caused a crisis. Consultants are competing with each other to get beds. Two years ago an eminent consultant in Cork University Hospital claimed that up to 1,000 cancer patients per year were dying because of inadequate treatment facilities, particularly radiotherapy. The consultant still stands over his claim that this is the case. Radiotherapy is one field where there are serious deficiencies. The Minister should take immediate action to overcome this difficulty. There are not enough radiotherapists. Of the 1,580 consultants in the country, only four or five radiotherapists operate in the public service. This is not good enough for a disease that affects one third of patients, 50% of whom need radiotherapy. There should be 40 radiotherapists for the Irish population.</P>
    <P>The head of the UK cancer research campaign, Professor Gordon McVie, recently compared British waiting lists for colonoscopy with the Dutch scenario where a test is available within days. He said that &ldquo;nowhere else in the civilised world are cancer patients treated so badly&rdquo;. He is incorrect as the Irish experience is more uncivilised. We need proper resources for research. Recently the director of the National Cancer Registry, Dr. Harry Comer, called for more resources to be made available to investigate why rates of bowel cancer are higher in Ireland compared to Europe. The key message from a new all Ireland report on the incidence of cancer is that it is a call to action to investigate the variations in cancer incidents and mortality in Ireland and Europe. Dr. Comer said they had identified in some cases quite a major difference between North and South and urban and rural Ireland and the rest of Europe. The Minister should immediately introduce a research programme into the high incidence of bowel cancer, as the medical <Col N="1225" /> profession does not know why this is the case. Bowel cancer is more common in Ireland than in the rest of Europe. This must be examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The prevention of lung cancer also needs to be addressed because all attempts at prevention to date have failed. There is an urgency to introduce a national prostate screening programme. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Ireland after skin cancer. Earlier this month the Department of Health and Children stated there were not any plans to introduce such a screening programme. If left untreated or if it is not diagnosed early, the cancer will gradually spread to surrounding tissues, such as the lymph nodes, the bones and then usually the spine and the ribs. While there is no cure for it, there are many treatments available. The earlier the cancer is detected, the greater the likelihood that treatment will stop it from spreading. Figures from the National Cancer Registry show that approximately 1,100 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year.</P>
    <P>The Minister must, as a matter or urgency, implement the recommendations of the report on the development of services for symptomatic breast cancer and specify the plans for the development of proposed breast units. Access to services for women with symptomatic breast disease is uneven, according to Europa Donna. It states that women treated in the type of multi-disciplinary breast units recommended in the report have better survival rates. Women must have equal access to high quality care, regardless of their income or where they live. The group states that there is an unacceptable waiting time for mammograms, for consultant appointments and for chemotherapy, particularly among public patients. I ask the Minister to respond to the submission of Europa Donna which was recently made to his Department. Earlier this year Mr. Michael Moriarty, consultant radiotherapist at St. Luke's Hospital painted a grim picture regarding the availability of radiotherapy services in Ireland. He stated that on average only 16% of cancer patients are receiving radiotherapy, despite the fact that up to 50% of patients could benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The Government has made much play of the increased expenditure on health care. However, Irish expenditure on health care is well below the EU average and health outcomes are disappointing according to the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. Compared to other EU members, Ireland has the lowest health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, standing at 6.3% compared to the EU average of 8.1%. Not alone are the services under pressure but services are being withdrawn because of shortages of facilities. In late last year a breast cancer clinic in the North-Eastern Health Board area was forced to suspend operations due to staff shortages. The North-Eastern Health Board mammography services at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan were suspended due to the turnover of staff and the diffi<Col N="1226" /> culties the board were encountering recruiting certain grades of staff. The nursing services manager of the hospital described this as very regrettable. This is not acceptable and should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister must immediately make available the facilities to prevent cancers for which a cause is known or suspected and to increase awareness and promote knowledge of the causes of cancer among professionals and the public to provide patients and their families with clear information on all treatment options available. The Minister must provide screening services of proven value in prevention and early detection. He must ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with uniform high quality care wherever patients live and he must ensure that treatments are provided appropriately and administered safely in accordance with established best practice. Treatments must be aimed at cure where possible and, failing this, at effective disease control and palliation. The patient should be cared for in a comprehensive way. This involves carrying out appropriate clinical and other investigations, providing care for complications arising from the disease and its treatment and offering appropriate emotional, social and psychological support. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Our health system is in a shambles. It is a system which favours the rich. Money talks. If one can afford it, one gets the services one needs but if one cannot, one waits. Ireland has the lowest number of hospital beds<i> per capita </i>within the EU. Chemotherapy is cancelled due to the lack of beds. This inequality in access to health care is a fundamental problem within our system. This is supported by the fact that there are more people buying health insurance as waiting lists increase. Time is the crucial element that can secure treatment and survival for a patient with cancer.</P>
      <P>The Minister will tell the House of the millions of pounds he is spending on our clapped out health service. It is allegedly a priority of this Government, yet in its term of office the percentage of funding for the health service has not increased. We are still below the EU average in relation to GDP investment in our health service. People should expect to receive equal medical services no matter what part of the country they live in. However, waiting lists can vary dramatically in different health board areas. Instead of one health service, there are ten health services. We need to decentralise our health services. We need to bring services back to communities where that is feasible. With the development of information technology these services are now feasible in rural towns and rural hospitals, not only in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that public representatives must plead with consultants to get treatment for people. That should not happen. It is no wonder that we have the worst cancer treatment in Europe. As Deputy <Col N="1227" /> Neville said, 1,000 people are dying each year because of lack of treatment. That is a damning indictment of our health services and cancer treatment. Cancer patients must queue to get treatment and to get a bed. Each year the number of people diagnosed with cancer is increasing. Each year under this Government people wait longer and longer for treatment and for beds. Young women with families waiting for breast cancer treatment are in a crisis. Panic sets in for many of these women as they wait for treatment. There is still no national screening service for breast cancer. In Ireland a woman with breast cancer is more likely to die than in any other EU country.</P>
    <P>Given the high level of awareness of cancer among women and the associated screening which is being put into operation, why are men left out? Apparently, it is not an issue of funding as there is no shortage of money, given that a sum of £1 billion is to be spent on the new &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. Overall, the incidence of cancer is 30% higher in men than in women. There is a one in three chance of developing cancer by the age of 74 and a one in four chance if skin cancer is excluded. There are still no plans to introduce a national prostate cancer screening programme according to the Department of Health and Children, yet prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men after skin cancer. According to the Department, the question of introducing screening programmes for different types of cancer is under review. How long will the matter be under review? How long must we wait before those screening services are put in place? Will the Minister give a date when those services will be provided? Every year, 1,100 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer. The earlier that disease is detected the greater the likelihood of survival, yet we still ignore the issue of cancer in men. This is despite the fact that men are less likely to visit their GP if they have a problem or concern.</P>
    <P>Our health system is crumbling. The Minister has invested money, but this has not worked and it is now time to ask questions. What about the management and the manager? Sadly, the Minister has done a bad job at that. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, last week when I listened to Mr. Joe Duffy's &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme on the radio and I have never known people as shocked as when a woman caller to the programme told listeners that she had cancer and was waiting for chemotherapy, yet could not get a hospital bed. One after another, callers expressed their shock. I have no idea of the politics of the callers but all said it was a shame and a disaster that such a situation could arise. If this motion does nothing else but spur the Minister to tackle this problem, it will have served a useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> There is talk of decentralising the various services, a need highlighted by the situation of a 77 year old man from east Galway who recently had to spend seven weeks receiving treatment at St. Luke's Hospital where he was extremely well treated. However, he had to stay in bed and breakfast accommodation from Monday to Friday for the seven weeks. The hospital could not take him as they had no places. The treatment took just ten minutes every day. The man had no relatives in Dublin and only occasional visitors from home over his period of treatment. Given the cloud hanging over him, it is difficult to imagine the fear such an elderly person would have in those circumstances. He received excellent treatment from the hospital, but for the other 23 hours of each day one can only imagine the problems that man experienced.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves the Government's continuing and sustained commitment to implementing the National Cancer Strategy and welcomes the significant investment which the Government has made in enhancing patient care and in improving cancer-related services generally.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I reject the motivation behind this Fine Gael motion which is clearly opportunistic and calculated to cause concern among a most vulnerable patient group. However, it provides me with the opportunity to put on record the significant resources in terms of infrastructure, personnel and services which this Government has put in place for cancer patients since the publication of the national cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>This motion has been prompted by recent publicity concerning access to treatment by a patient in the Mater Hospital. It is not my intention to discuss the details of an individual patient's treatment as the provision of such treatment is a matter for the individual consultant and hospital concerned. It is unacceptable as a general principle for a patient's treatment to be disrupted and I know that Mater Hospital management has taken steps to ensure that the most immediate issues are addressed. I have already indicated that if there are resource issues to be addressed, I am willing to sympathetically consider any proposals I receive in the matter from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the agency responsible for planning service needs in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be given the opportunity tonight to outline the developments to date under <Col N="1229" /> the national cancer strategy and to brief the House on the areas of cancer services identified as priority areas for future development. The 1994 health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, set out a framework for the reorientation of our health care system. The reorganisation of our cancer treatment services was an integral part of this strategy and targets were set for reducing the mortality from cancer in the under-65 year age group by 15% in the period 1994 to 2004. Health care services were to be focused on improvements in health status and quality of life and increased emphasis was to be placed on the provision of the most appropriate care for patients.</P>
    <P>Cancer was identified as one of the major sources of premature mortality in Ireland. The effect of cancer on health status in Ireland is striking. There was a clear need to address this and the national cancer strategy emerged as an evidence-based initiative to enable high quality cancer services to be developed throughout the country. The two principal objectives of the strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in Shaping a Healthier Future; and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>There are specific objectives in relation to key elements of the cancer strategy concerning such areas as prevention of cancers for which a cause is known or suspected; access to equitable, effective, quality services throughout the country; improved quality of life for patients; appropriate multidisciplinary treatment administered safely and in accordance with best practice guidelines; greater co-ordination of cancer treatment services from primary care to hospital care through to rehabilitation and palliative care; promotion of arrangements for appropriate research and education for those providing cancer services; and there should be a co-ordinated approach by all those involved in the care and treatment of patients with cancer to ensure that all services are provided in a cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that a range of support structures was put in place to co-ordinate and take a lead role in the implementation of the national cancer strategy. The first National Cancer Forum was established under the chairmanship of Professor James Fennelly. The forum, a multidisciplinary body, proved to be extremely useful and advised on many issues central to the successful implementation of the strategy. The term of office of the first forum expired last year and I subsequently appointed Professor Paul Redmond as the chairman of the second National Cancer Forum. The forum is currently examining a number of issues of tremendous importance to the effective progression of the development of cancer services in this country. Areas such as protocols for the care and treatment of cancer patients, information requirements, audit and evaluation of our services are all important com<Col N="1230" /> ponent parts of the appropriate future development of cancer services and the forum, as the established expert advisory body, will report to me on these issues.</P>
    <P>Regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area to oversee and co-ordinate the development of cancer services in their respective areas in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards. I appointed regional directors of cancer services in each health board area last year and these posts are proving to be of great benefit in assisting in the development of appropriate future cancer services. I am pleased to report that considerable and tangible progress has been made to date under the national cancer strategy which has progressed beyond the original commitments made in the action plan for its implementation about which I will brief the House.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the national cancer strategy was estimated to cost £25 million when it was launched. The sum allocated for the strategy in 1997 was £6 million. Since then, the Government has invested some £60 million in cancer prevention, treatment and care services, with £11 million being invested last year and almost £19 million being invested this year in such services. All of the commitments made in the action plan for the implementation of the strategy have been fully funded and have either been implemented or are in the course of implementation. The main implementation elements of the strategy included the areas of cancer prevention, early detection and screening, additional consultant appointments in key areas of cancer treatment and care and cancer research.</P>
    <P>Cancers occur as a result of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Risk of cancer depends on age, sex, genetic make-up and where and how people live. To some extent, certain aspects of cancer risk are within our own control. There is strong evidence that lifestyle and environmental factors play an important role in the development of cancer. The use of tobacco, the excessive consumption of alcohol and unhealthy diet all contribute to increasing the risk of developing cancer. In spite of the fact that the EU directive on the banning of tobacco advertising was struck down, I successfully introduced legislation to ban the advertisement of tobacco in Irish newspapers and magazines. Contrary to Deputy Mitchell's assertion, the Minister for Finance is also keen to remove the cost of tobacco from the CPI but this matter is not within the Government's decision-making jurisdiction. Independent agencies must call for that. I am currently progressing this issue as it is a key factor in this country in the context of tobacco and alcohol alike.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public is made aware of the scope for preventing many cancers by making appropriate lifestyle changes. To this end, the health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and aware<Col N="1231" /> ness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. These include mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The unit also provides funding to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives, including the yearly Europe Against Cancer campaign.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000. Phase one of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age, on an area by area basis. In the period January to March 2001, approximately 2,700 women per month were screened at the BreastCheck units and approximately 700 per month were screened on the mobile unit. Less than l% of those screened are admitted to hospital for further management.</P>
    <P>The board of BreastCheck has reviewed progress to date and has informed me it is pleased with the level of uptake in the areas screened to date. Uptake levels have virtually reached their target of 70%, while meeting the quality parameters set and providing evidence of a significant level of screen detected cancers. The successful roll-out of the programme is dependent on a number of factors, including the availability of appropriately trained staff. BreastCheck offers suitably skilled radiographers the opportunity to work in state of the art facilities in addition to an attractive employment package and the board has taken a number of initiatives, including an international advertising programme, to address the current shortage of suitably skilled radiographers.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck, in conjunction with the school of diagnostic imaging at the Faculty of Medicine, UCD has also set up a post-graduate diploma in mammographic imaging, the first of its kind in Ireland. This joint initiative aims to increase levels of mammographic trained radiographers in Ireland and share the experiences of BreastCheck with other mammography services. The board of BreastCheck plans to carry out a national feasibility study on the availability of skilled staff for the programme and this is expected to be completed in a number of months. The board expects to provide me with recommendations regarding the extension of the programme to the rest of the country later this year. This is an area in which I am keenly interested but we must avoid rhetoric on this issue. We must not continue rolling out a campaign which is not appropriately backed up in terms of treatment centres etc. as to do so would be reckless and irresponsible.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of rationale behind the manner in which we are now progressing the BreastCheck programme. We are doing so on a proper professional basis so as to obtain the best results for the women of this country. I am committed to the extension of BreastCheck to ensure that women throughout the country have the <Col N="1232" /> highest quality breast screening services available to them. This involves, not only screening services, but also the availability of quality symptomatic services so that an equally high standard of hospital care is available for those who may require it following a screening detected cancer.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck is providing an excellent, intensely quality-assured service for screened women who believe that they are healthy and for the treatment of women who, through screening, are discovered to have breast cancer. It is essential that this service be matched by an equally excellent service for those with symptomatic breast disease. As the plans for the commencement of BreastCheck progressed, it soon became apparent that the symptomatic breast cancer services in this country were not provided in the manner which would or should lead to the best outcomes for women. International experience tells us that women who are treated in a multidisciplinary centre, where all the relevant medical expertise is on one site and where there is a minimum number of patients with similar disease treated by the same team, have a greater chance of long-term survival and have less chance of their disease recurring than those treated in smaller centres. Having regard to these concerns, my predecessor Deputy Cowen, requested the National Cancer Forum to review symptomatic breast disease services nationally. The forum established a sub-group to undertake this task. The report on the Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease was presented to me in April of last year. I accepted the broad thrust of this report and established an advisory group to meet with all the health boards to advise and assist in formulating regional plans for its implementation.</P>
    <P>Concerns were raised in many areas because of a perceived notion that certain smaller hospitals around the country would be downgraded if they did not maintain their mammography services. I would like to stress to the House that this report was not about the downgrading or closure of any hospital. It is about the reorganisation and development of breast disease services in centres of excellence to ensure that every effort is made to reduce the number of women in this country who die from breast cancer every year. I want to assure Deputy Mitchell that I have bitten the bullet regarding this report and its recommendations despite the efforts of his senior colleagues who tried to sabotage the implementation of this report by scare tactics in localities across the country which did no service to the work of the sub-group regarding the centres of excellence. Nonetheless, I pressed ahead and have provided funding of more than £4 million this year to enable a number of agencies to commence the development of seven centres of excellence for the treatment of symptomatic breast disease. It is my intention to proceed with the remaining six centres in the Estimates for 2002. We are awaiting proposals from the health boards in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> Phase One of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. Under the programme, in the region of 67,000 women of between 25 and 60 years of age will be screened, free of charge, at minimum intervals of five years. The question of extending the programme to the rest of the country is currently under consideration by my Department in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the expert advisory group on cervical screening. A number of key consultant appointments were committed to under the National Cancer Strategy. All of the commitments made in the Action Plan have been met at this stage and additional appointments were made in the areas of medical oncology, histopathology, haematology and palliative care.</P>
    <P>New consultant medical oncology appointments have been made or approved in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board, Mid-Western Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board, North-Western Health Board, South-Eastern Health Board, Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board. Likewise, new consultant haematology appointments have been made or approved in the following areas: Midland Health Board, Mid-Western Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board, North-Western Health Board, South-Eastern Health Board, Southern Health Board and Western Health Board. In addition, I have provided funding of £2 million this year to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the further development of oncology and haematology services.</P>
    <P>New consultant histopathology appointments have been made or approved in the following areas: Eastern Regional Health Authority, Mid-Western Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board, North-Western Health Board, South-Eastern Health Board, Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board. New consultant appointments in the areas of palliative care have been made or approved in the following areas: Eastern Regional Health Authority, Mid-Western Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board, North-Western Health Board, South-Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board. In addition, funding has been provided to the Midland Health Board for a palliative care consultant.</P>
    <P>In addition to the appointment of palliative care consultants in the areas mentioned, the National Cancer Forum advised that as these important services were at an early stage of development in this country, it would be appropriate to obtain detailed advice on their further development. This Government's Action Programme for the Millennium contained a commitment to develop a national palliative care plan. In this context, a national review of palliative care services was undertaken under the chairmanship of Dr. Tony O'Brien, a report of which will be published in the near future. That in itself out<Col N="1234" /> lines a very significant degree of necessary investment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned consultant appointments, there have been additional consultant appointments resulting from the National Cancer Strategy as follows: two new consultant posts approved in the specialty of radiation clinical oncology at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and additional consultant surgeon appointments with special interest in breast disease and gastrointestinal disease in various locations throughout the country. More than 55 posts have been sanctioned since the Government took office as a result of an identified need and in a strategic manner. Everything we are doing under the cancer strategy is strategic by nature; it is not<i> ad hoc</i>, we are not filling in gaps as Deputy Mitchell suggested. It is strategic in terms of how we are rolling out the services, taking on the expert advice and providing the funding.</P>

      <P>Statistics available from the national cancer registry show that the number of primary treatments for cancer have increased significantly year on year since 1994. That is a very important point. In 1994, there were 12,682 primary surgery treatments for cancer. By 1998, this had increased to 16,470. The number of patients receiving chemotherapy/hormone treatment has also increased significantly from 3,796 in 1994 to 4,974 in 1998. These figures refer only to treatments given for the initial disease and not for any recurrence or for palliative purposes. HIPE data shows that the total number of treatments for cancer has increased from 36,442 in 1997 to 50,063 in 1999. That is a very significant increase in a short number of years and is indicative of the <Col N="1235" /> fact that more specialist consultants were treating cancer patients and reflects a more active and aggressive approach to the management of cancer. A substantial increase in drug costs has resulted from the more complex treatment options offered to patients. This was not envisaged when the strategy commenced and following consultation with the chief executives and regional directors of cancer services I have made additional funding of £6 million available to health agencies this year for this purpose. We are far more generous than other jurisdictions in terms of allowing for a whole range of treatments.</P>
      <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service, requiring specialist personnel, including, for example, therapeutic radiographers, nurses with training in oncology, technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required in order to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service. Because of these considerations and the complexity of radiotherapy services, the national cancer strategy recommended that radiotherapy services should be provided from two supra-regional centres. The two centres currently providing radiotherapy services to cancer patients are St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>The strategy recommended that the case for providing a radiotherapy service from a third supra-regional centre at Galway should be kept under review. I am pleased to report that this Government acted quickly in assessing that case and took the decision to provide a service at Galway at an estimated cost of £10 million. That is what I was referring to when I interrupted Deputy Connaughton. We have taken action to provide those services in the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now established a sub-group. The radiotherapy service there will be provided as part of the overall phase two development at the hospital. This is currently under way. In addition to this major investment in new radiotherapy facilities, the existing services available have also been benefiting from a major injection of resources. I announced an important investment in radiotherapy and other cancer services in Cork University Hospital, with the allocation of £12.5 million for this purpose. The development will include a chemotherapy day unit, two state of the art linear accelerators and advanced CT simulation facilities. Together with approval for the appointment of two consultant medical oncologists, the improvements will ensure that the service for cancer patients in this area is in line with the best available internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State's largest radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospital opened in June 1998, having undergone a major redevelopment funded by a capital investment of over £20 million. Last year, two additional consultant radio<Col N="1236" /> therapists were appointed to the hospital as part of the ongoing process of developing services there.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the National Cancer Forum, I established an expert working group to examine the future requirements of radiotherapy services nationally. I was anxious that the group would produce results as quickly as possible. It is taking a strategic and evidence-based approach to this issue. The work of this group is at an advanced stage and I expect to receive its recommendations in the coming months. The group will deal with the issue of geographic coverage.</P>
    <P>The effective management of cancer services requires a fuller understanding of its causes and in this context cancer strategy funding was provided to the Health Research Board to co-ordinate cancer research projects. The signing of the NCI all-Ireland memorandum of understanding in Belfast in October 1999 by the National Cancer Institutes of the United States, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland gave further impetus to cancer research and international co-operation in the area of cancer.</P>
    <P>This tripartite agreement facilitates the sharing of information on cancer treatment between the countries involved, with particular emphasis on epidemiology and cancer registries, scholar exchange and clinical trials. The recently launched all-Ireland cancer statistics is a joint report on the incidence of, and mortality from, cancer on the island of Ireland and is part of this initiative. I am pleased to inform the House that I have provided £500,000 this year to enable these developments to commence. This initiative will significantly contribute to the understanding of cancer and, thus, to its effective management.</P>
    <P>As previously mentioned, the second National Cancer Forum established last year is currently examining a number of areas for priority development, including the establishment of evidence-based guidelines and care pathways for the management of patients with cancer. This will ultimately lead to uniformity in cancer care throughout the country which will result in a reduction in mortality and the delivery of more effective and efficient cancer services.</P>
    <P>The House will gather from the breadth and scale of the investment I have described that I am well aware of the need for further investment in cancer services and will continue to identify this as a priority. The national cancer strategy has achieved a widespread enhancement of the range and quality of cancer services available and a major improvement in equity of access to these services. However, we must continue to look ahead and to examine ways of building on the success to date by continual improvement and investment. It is also important that cancer needs are addressed in the context of the ongoing bed capacity review which will shortly come before Government and the impending new health strategy. It is time for a strategic look at health services but I disagree with Deputy Mitchell's obser<Col N="1237" /> vations on what that strategy involves. Seven years after the previous strategy is an opportune time to look forward in terms of a new strategy.</P>

      <P>I cannot over-emphasise my commitment to the further development of cancer services. Cancer is a scourge on this society as it is on societies throughout the world. While it must be recognised that significant progress has been made in the development of our infrastructure and services for the treatment and prevention of this disease, I am equally aware of the need for a continued concerted effort in this area. It is my intention to continue to work with the National Cancer Forum to ensure that those people requiring cancer treatment services will have available to them a high quality, equitable service that matches the best available anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Hanafin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised by Deputy Mitchell's motion which criticises the Government, particularly in light of the fact that, in a recent radio programme in which he treated us to his choice of music, Deputy Noonan stated that it is only since Deputy Martin took over as Minister that a further advance is being made in the treatment of cancer. When one receives such recognition from the Leader of the Opposition one is surprised by a motion such as this which does not take cognisance of what is happening regarding the provision of cancer services.</P>

      <P>I am saddened that Deputy Mitchell would use a topic as serious as cancer as an opportunity to talk about appointments to boards and that he would make political points about something which has nothing to do with this subject. Cancer hits at the core of every family. Every Member has been affected by cancer by way of family or friends and we have lost Members to cancer. It is sad that Deputy Mitchell would abuse this situation when most Members are genuinely interested in this topic.</P>
      <P>The Minister has drawn attention to the wide range of efforts involved in the implementation of the national cancer strategy. This strategy is far-reaching and is continually expanding now that greater needs are being identified. The additional investment, increased staffing and the provision of services throughout the country can only, one hopes, lead to better statistics than those cited in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reorganising cancer treatment services will ensure a patient focus and equity of access. I too am aware that people have to drive home after chemotherapy treatment. However, do people receiving only ten minutes of chemotherapy need <Col N="1238" /> a bed? Medical advances are such that people can now access medical treatment on a day-patient basis, which is to be welcomed. However, the development of the centre of excellence in Galway which will provide chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment will be of great benefit to people who have to travel from the west.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the resources allocated for screening and early detection programmes. These programmes are of proven value and those concerning cervical and breast cancer are of interest to all women. The Minister cited the encouraging statistics regarding the uptake of the breast screening programme. However, I wish the 70% take-up rate would grow to 90% or 100%. Most Members have come across women who say they will not bother going for screening as the mammogram is painful. However, it is not half as painful as cancer and we should all do our bit to encourage women to avail of the opportunity of screening.</P>
    <P>The development of the strategy also involves the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. Deputy Naughten accused the Government of ignoring men's health. However, it is men who ignore men's health. They are the worst culprits in terms of looking after their own health. The fact that the Government is providing resources and facilities cannot compensate for people who do not look after their own health. This is also true of women and children.</P>
    <P>Skin cancer is one of the cancers not referred to so far in this debate. However, after only three days of sun people are showing the effects of sunburn. We might be excited by the sun but we are careless of its long-term effects on health. The same is true of women who speak about availing of the service while they never have a smear test or check for a lump. I visited the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital and saw hundreds of women, and the only thing these women had in common was that they were waiting for the results of tests. I welcome the fact that St. Vincent's is now a centre which provides the best service and top-class diagnostic facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the important development of specialist palliative care services as it facilitates greater co-ordination of cancer research. Members are aware of the European code against cancer and research throughout the EU. However, research is only of use if people follow its findings. These findings include the manner in which healthy lifestyles assist people and the effects of smoking. Statistics indicate that at least 1,500, perhaps 2,000, people die of lung cancer each year. Of these cases, 95% are caused by smoking. The Government can play its part by way of tobacco legislation but people must shoulder the greatest responsibility for this situation.</P>
    <P>The treatment of cancer demands much input and financial investment. The centres of excellence have been identified as the way forward. The cancer strategy is aimed at developing these centres of excellence and concentrated expertise <Col N="1239" /> so we can achieve a multidisciplinary approach. It is natural and politically unfortunate that counties which will not have a centre of excellence are demanding a small local service. Patients want what is best and, not being politicians, patients will want to go to a centre of excellence because they have a throughput of people and can recognise, quickly diagnose and treat cancer.</P>
    <P>The centres of excellence are bringing services closer to people's homes, thus ensuring access and a high-quality service. Great progress has been made by the national cancer strategy since 1997. However, even as the health service has developed, health boards have identified a range of additional needs with regard to surgery, radiotherapy, cancer nurses, drug costs and palliative care. These areas will continue to demand further funding and the Government is committed to providing it. It is also committed to supporting counselling, other support services and nurse education. This issue was highlighted recently when I launched Daffodil Day with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's son. The support services for patients provided by voluntary organisations and funded by the Department mean&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is now four years since the Government took office. The Taoiseach and his Government were elected on a programme to deliver on priorities in health care, to create a customer focused health care service and to target key health care areas for special attention. He promised to tackle the crisis in hospital waiting lists, but four years later the failure of both he and his Government is painfully evident. Waiting lists are still chronically long, waiting times for certain specialties have increased and the health service is overstretched and understaffed as patients suffer and even die as they wait for treatment they need. Nowhere are the deficiencies in the Government record more acute than in cancer treatment services. While the Government claims an increased spend on health, the experience of cancer patients tells a different and terrible story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cancer patient who attended hospital for chemotherapy recently was prevented from completing a course of treatment for weeks because no bed was available for her. Another cancer patient, a man who had already had surgery once, found that further surgery he needed was repeatedly postponed because of a shortage of beds. He presented himself at the hospital seven times and it was only on the eighth occasion that he was able to access the surgery he so desperately needed. Another woman telephoned me recently <Col N="1240" /> and told me that her specialist is concerned that symptoms she is displaying may be caused by cervical cancer. She has been told that it will take three months for the results of her cervical smear test to be delivered to her specialist. I asked an oncology specialist if such experiences were exceptional. He assured me that these were common events for many cancer patients and were not exceptional.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday, Dr. Des Carney, a consultant medical oncologist in the Mater Hospital, said:</P>
    <P>There are people who need to be treated as a matter of urgency. They need to have their treatment on schedule; that is their best chance of a cure. The problem with beds has been there a long time, and it is an extremely frustrating one. Consultants are competing with each other to get beds. We are also competing with casualty to get beds and this is wrong.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that when the Government came into power, a national cancer strategy had already been prepared. The Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, are generous people. It is an indication of how defensive they are feeling that they did not credit the origin of the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned it in my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch that; it did not penetrate very far in terms of the Minister's references to the cancer strategy. Our strategy was well thought out and targeted a particular need. It seized an initiative and it is a model for how the Government could have strategically dealt with developing a new and better health service. If it had been adopted, the health service would be in a much better state now.</P>
      <P>As other speakers noted, the prevalence of cancer is high in Ireland, particularly among women. The rate of breast cancer is high, but the screening programme which is effective and particularly helpful for women over the age of 50 years is being developed at a slow pace. Women in my county of Wicklow have still to be called by BreastCheck. I have received calls from constituents who want to know why they have not been called. They are as much at risk from breast cancer as any other woman in any other part of the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. What is the position regarding the women who make up the 50% of the population who live outside the areas that have been targeted? Are their lives somehow less in need of the protection that this screening programme offers? If, as the organisers of BreastCheck believe, deaths from breast cancer can be reduced by 20%, why are women whose lives could be saved being effectively condemned to die because they live in the wrong parts of Ireland? There is a need to deliver a genuine national screening programme that reaches all parts of the country at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> Cervical screening has proved to be an even more effective way of saving women's lives yet no national screening programme is in place. Most shamefully, women on the GMS must pay for this service if they wish to have a routine cervical smear test, something all women are exhorted to have done. I take issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. Women want to access screening programmes; that is not the problem. There is no need to encourage women. The problem is that the service is not being fully delivered to them. Cervical cancer is a preventable disease and screening is a most effective way of detecting it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to testicular cancer, which is the most common cause of cancer in young men. A national screening programme could make a significant difference in detecting this disease but there is no sign of such a programme being instituted. If detected early enough, this cancer is 90% curable. This raises issues about the delivery of services in terms of general practice primary care and particularly the GMS. Screening on an ongoing basis is not part of the GMS. Services such as vaccination are taken as special items and the natural area in which screening could take place at primary care level is not being properly exploited and developed. It is impossible for a proper screening programme to be delivered in this way as long as patients are not registered with general practitioners.</P>
    <P>Another example is bowel cancer. It runs in families and it is now becoming possible to test for a genetic predisposition to it. However, these genetic techniques are not being considered or included in the Department's measures. Increasingly, pharmogenetics will play a central role in tackling certain cancers but they do not appear to have impinged on Government policy. The use of genetics in health care and its delivery is a huge challenge facing the Government. However, it appears it cannot see the elephant.</P>
    <P>Although it was handed a strategy on cancer, the Government has not moved with any great sense of urgency. There have been some welcome improvements in hospitals, but the service to cancer patients is at best patchy and uneven across the country. It is being directly damaged in Dublin in particular by bed and staff shortages. The expert view and recommendation of Professor Niall O'Higgins is that there should be 13 hospital cancer centres across the country. I welcome the Minister's commitment in this regard and I hope he follows it up. As an election draws closer, questions will be asked about whether the Government, instead of securing the kind of excellence of service that is required to meet the needs of cancer patients, funks the issue when faced with local opposition. People will ask what is more important to the Government &ndash; the delivery of high quality cancer care, inevitably centralised to an extent throughout the country, or pacifying local interests.</P>
    <P>Local communities are committed to maintaining their local hospitals. I support this good <Col N="1242" /> commitment and the Government, despite all its limitations, should be able to provide a good future for local hospitals. However, this must be done in a way that does not put patient care at risk. This challenge needs to be discussed and real policies need to be put forward because there is an important role for the local hospital in terms of the delivery of quality care that is appropriate to its size and capability. However, on the basis of its track record, the Government has ducked difficult questions rather than face up to the changing nature of health care.</P>
    <P>When it comes to overall health care, it is obvious that the Government has no idea what to do about the health service. It is spending a great deal of money &ndash; although it is probably not enough &ndash; but it does not have a coherent plan on how to provide a quality health service to everyone who needs it. The Minister's statement at the launch of the health strategy's national consultative forum is dispiriting if not illuminating. It is dispiriting because it shows the Government has no strategy for health care. After lurching from one health crisis to the other the Government now wants to know what it should have been doing over the past four years. It is illuminating because the public has realised this is one last effort by Fianna Fáil to get a lifeline on health policy before the next general election.</P>
    <P>At the launch the Minister asked many questions, including should we move to a rights based approach to access to health care? How can we achieve fair access for all based on medical need? What are the pros and cons of moving away from the current tax based system of funding health care? How do we compare with other developed countries? What impact does the public/private mix have on the effective use of resources? What level of funding is needed to achieve a more people centred, equitable and high quality health service? Many other questions were posed by the Minister, who is a member of a Government that has been in charge of the health services for the past four years.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate why he is only asking these questions now? Why did he and his predecessor not ask them four years ago when they made these commitments to the public? Why did he not get answers from the fine and large Department he runs? The Government was elected to deliver on health care as a priority. Coming towards the end of its term it has yet to decide what are its priorities in this regard.</P>
    <P>In our proposals, outlined in the document, Curing our Ills, the Labour Party sets out its priorities. We seem to have set the agenda for the Government. The elimination of a two tier health service and the provision of free GP care form the central planks of our policy. When we articulated them a year ago they were new and controversial and they were considered to be radical. Today there is widespread support for our objectives from within the medical profession and the public. We set the agenda while the Minister still poses the questions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> The record of the Taoiseach has been less than impressive. When he speaks about health, which is rarely, he generally refers to money. While the Government has spent a lot more money on health, it has much more to spend. The Taoiseach has a different priority, for Abbotstown, which is likely to cost at least £1 billion. Nobody would argue that we should not invest in sports facilities. Even on health grounds it is worthwhile. Many argue that investment should be made in local sports facilities, such as football pitches, swimming pools, running tracks or boxing clubs while others support the grand project at Abbotstown. Regardless of what side of the argument one favours there is unanimity among the public that cancer patients should not come second to the development of a range of sports facilities, whether at Abbotstown or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, that every family has been touched by cancer and they want the best possible care for those who suffer from it. I suspect that every family knows they have been sold short by the Government. What shocks people most is the lesser priority it is giving to the health service. People know the Government must make choices about its priorities and they know the kind of dedication of resources, including the strategic planning of management resources, going into the Abbotstown project could and should have been directed towards the transformation of the hospital service.</P>
    <P>Even long standing members of Fianna Fáil are disturbed by the poor state of the health service and the lack of attention it is receiving by the Taoiseach. In the past Seán Lemass delivered economic growth, Donogh O'Malley delivered free second level education and Erskine Childers delivered a quality general medical scheme for the poor. These men understood the hardship people had to endure and responded to their needs. Their legacy lives after them, not in bricks and mortar but in the transformed lives and opportunities of citizens. That kind of outlook is needed now. Regrettably, this Government is deficient of any vision or ambition to transform society and to meet the needs of today's citizens.</P>
    <P>The health service is riven with inequality in a society where inequality is being made worse by the Government's policies. We could have a great health service, a wonderful education system, a comprehensive child care programme, an effective transport network and a high quality clean environment. However, we have none of these things because we have a bad Government, even though it is in power in good times.</P>
    <P>A Seán Lemass or a Donogh O'Malley would have delivered a world class health service accessible to all who need it but the Taoiseach comes from a more recent tradition in Fianna Fáil. He wants to leave another kind of legacy. The former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, led Fianna Fáil in a very different manner from his predecessors. The extent of that difference is being revealed to us <Col N="1244" /> daily through the work of the tribunals. We know Charles Haughey liked to leave physical monuments behind, including Temple Bar, the IFSC and Government Buildings. His loyal lieutenant, the Taoiseach, shares the same desire. Deputy Bertie Ahern is not in the Seán Lemass or Donogh O'Malley mould. At Abbotstown he is seeking to leave a legacy that is even more extravagant and costly than Charles Haughey could dream of. In the meantime the health service is creaking from a lack of focus, direction and leadership. The Minister is making the best job he can of it. When he cannot make a good job of promoting his views he apportions blame to the hospitals when things do not work out.</P>
    <P>When he spoke of health promotion and cancer research, the Minister did not mention the issue of poverty, yet it is clear from the research undertaken on a North-South basis that poverty is a significant factor in terms of ensuring an improved health status for the population. Jane Wilde made a similar point recently in <i>The Irish Times.</i> She pointed out that countries with a narrow gap between the rich and the poor, where there is more equality, generally have a better health status. However, the Minister for Finance advises us to party while his financial policies deepen the chasm between the better off and the poor. No wonder the Minister for Health and Children is silent.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to talk about lifestyle, smoking and drinking but over the past four years the problems stored up will create a worse situation. Young people are drinking, smoking and taking drugs to a much greater extent. It is not as if the problems go back a long time, it is that they are getting significantly worse.</P>
    <P>I hoped when the Government took up office it knew what it was doing. It is clear that is not the case. Any future health strategy must have meaning and clear objectives. We must learn from the past in terms of devising strategies. The cancer strategy devised by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, has stood up to the test of time although it can always be improved. The Government is deficient in that kind of thinking. More than anything the health service needs strategic planning and leadership from the Taoiseach. The loss of this is creating many problems for cancer and other patients who are desperate to access and avail of services at a time of such plenty.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Immigrant Workers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this important matter, about which there has been a number of reports. This issue requires Government action of a type we have not seen to date. The plight of non-national workers is giving rise to much concern. In light of our current deficit of workers and the fact that the Tánaiste reckons we will need tens of thousands of non-national workers over the next couple of years if we are to fulfil our labour requirement, there is a greater onus on us to ensure that the workers who come to work in this country with valid permits and passports are treated in the same way as national workers.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that the Government invites workers from abroad to come to this country to take up employment but then does not offer an adequate programme of protection once they arrive in the State. It is clear that there is systematic exploitation over a wide range of sectors. It is important that we get a proper assessment of the problem with a view to rectifying it.</P>
      <P>The work permit arrangement must be subjected to review to stop unscrupulous employers and employment agencies from engaging in direct exploitation and extortion where immigrant workers are concerned. Enforcement of the domestic regulations which apply to workers is dependent on a complement of 17 inspectors to police them. That is hardly sufficient and requires considerable improvement. The problem is particularly acute in the hotel and catering sector as well as in the meat industry and agri-related outdoor activities. Numerous cases of exploitation of foreign nursing staff have been highlighted recently.</P>
      <P>This represents the tip of the iceberg. The most common complaints include long hours, no overtime pay, lack of information, working Sundays and weekends for no extra pay and general insecurity as far as rights and terms and conditions of employment are concerned. This results in a certain amount of fear and anxiety on the part of hundreds of workers who have come to this country to earn a livelihood and participate in our economic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, the work permit means the employee is indentured to a specific employer. The personal nature of the work permit dissuades an exploited employee from making a complaint. That is why the complaints which have come to our notice represent the tip of the iceberg. Many <Col N="1246" /> people are fearful of making a complaint lest they suffer deportation from the State. I know of employees who have been told that if they bring a complaint to the authorities, they will be sent home immediately and will not have an opportunity to work any longer in the State. Many non-national workers have come to this country after paying vast sums of money to agencies and middlemen to give them access to the State in the first instance. In many cases they will not give their names and addresses.</P>
    <P>The Department must undertake a vigorous campaign to address this matter. I hope prosecutions will be forthcoming in cases which have been brought to the notice of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Flanagan raising this issue this evening. I have taken a personal interest in the matter in recent times given the issues that need to be addressed. Increasingly, employers in Ireland are turning to immigrant workers to fill vacancies that they are unable to fill through Irish or EEA nationals. Generally, an employer is required to apply for a work permit if he or she wishes to employ any person who is not a national of an EU or EEA state. The EEA comprises the European Union together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</P>
      <P>In the examination of work permit applications, the proposed pay and conditions of employment of immigrant workers are examined to ensure that they comply with the statutory rates of pay or other pay rates as determined from time to time by the joint labour committees of the Labour Court. In addition, the proposed working week must comply with the Working Time Act. The number of work permits issued has increased significantly in the past two years from just over 6,000 in 1999 to more than 18,000 last year, an increase of 300%.</P>
      <P>I am aware of media reports in regard to the treatment of certain non-nationals placed in employment here which suggest a total disregard for the employment rights of the people concerned by a number of unscrupulous Irish employers and employment agencies. With regard to today's media reports, my Department is writing to the Consumers Association of Ireland seeking details of their relevant complaints. Any abuses of such statutory employment rights and protections that immigrant workers may have been subjected to are to be unreservedly condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental tenet of my Department's strategy statement is that the statutory rights and entitlements of all who work in Ireland will continue to be assured and enforced and that effective mechanisms by which they can vindicate their legal rights will be provided. This principle holds good in relation to all workers, irrespective of their nationality, and it lies at the heart of my Department's policy and approach in regard to the enforcement of employment rights in the <Col N="1247" /> workplace. My labour inspectorate, in conducting its enforcement responsibilities under labour legislation, operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</P>
    <P>I am determined that we eliminate any abusive treatment of immigrant workers already in employment here and stamp out practices such as employment contract switching, that is, switching the contract offered before the immigrant worker leaves his or her home country to a revised one presented upon their arrival in Ireland. We are taking a number of specific initiatives. The feasibility of administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries is being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of immigrant workers in Ireland. A fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, is under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business. The work permit administrative procedures are being amended to ensure that the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned are better protected and to facilitate more effective enforcement.</P>
    <P>Employment agencies operating in Ireland must be licensed in accordance with the requirements of the Employment Agency Act, 1971. The Act permits employment agencies to charge placement fees to the employers for whom they source the foreign workers but it precludes them from charging placement fees to the individual workers concerned. The media reports have alleged that agencies both in Ireland and abroad are charging fees to the foreign workers who come here. My labour inspectorate has been and still is investigating these allegations.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that the labour inspectorate is powerless to intervene in cases where employment offers or contracts presented to foreign workers are reneged upon when they arrive in Ireland. This is because no breach of statute law arises in such cases, except to the extent that the contract itself provides for terms or conditions which are illegal under Irish employment legislation, enforcement of a contract of employment being a matter for the civil courts under the common law of contract.</P>
    <P>To minimise the opportunity for Irish employers and employment agencies to mislead would-be immigrant workers about their employment conditions, especially in the matter of pay and general employment rights entitlements, certain adjustments are being made to the administrative process. These new processes will require the provision in writing of specific job-related information and conditions to the immigrant worker before he or she leaves his or her home country.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. As to the labour inspectorate, I am alert to the necessity to ensure a responsive and efficient inspection service. To this end a business process re-engineering project is under way to review the systems and procedures underlying employment rights information provision and inspection and the resulting follow-through actions. In the past 12 months I have increased the number of inspectors to 17. I appreciate Deputy Flanagan's point about the number of inspectors, but we have increased it.</P>
      <P>The labour inspectorate's business plan for the current year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employment hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed. Plans for the commencement and implementation of that campaign are well advanced.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputy Flanagan and any other Member who has evidence of a breach of employment legislation to provide that information to me as a matter of urgency. I will ensure the labour inspectorate investigates it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to deal briefly with the economic position in the Cooley Peninsula. A case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in the area a number of weeks ago which resulted in a complete cull of the sheep population in the area. A significant percentage of the farming population is very dependent on the income it derives from sheep production. As a consequence, many farmers, especially those employed on a full-time basis, have found themselves dependent on farm assist or forced to seek alternative employment outside their normal role of working on sheep farms in the area. Adjusting to alternative employment for those who have spent their entire working lives on a farm, especially one on the hillsides, is not easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the repopulation of the area is being considered. While it may be early days, it is no harm for preliminary work to commence on the plans and strategy for repopulation. A task force is in place embracing various interests in the industry which will plan that strategy and <Col N="1249" /> implement it over a number of years. The greatest cause for concern is the serious loss of income. There will be no cashflow on many of the farms concerned. It is reasonable to assume the repopulation process will take a period of years as opposed to weeks or months. As a consequence, the problem will be with us into the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Many farmers who have reached their mid-50s will be examining the potential offered to them by the revamped early retirement from farming scheme. I hope they can combine it with the installation aid scheme to allow sons or daughters or, perhaps, nephews or nieces to commence farming and derive the financial support available under both those headings.</P>
    <P>In many other areas throughout the country the availability of initiatives under the general heading of rural development has been very worthwhile. While the county enterprise board and other agencies in Louth have actively encouraged investment in small and medium-sized enterprises, a point has been reached where there is a need to accelerate the efforts in the Cooley Peninsula. The population there will be interested to hear what the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, has to say. It is fortunate he has responsibility for rural development. There are strong similarities in the geography and economic structure of the Cooley Peninsula and the area of west Galway he represents. I will be delighted to hear from him. I invite him to visit the Cooley area to see the practical problems and difficulties there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as ucht an cheist seo a thógaint sa Dáil mar is dóigh liom gur cheist fíor-thábhachtach é. At the outset, I pay tribute to the great public effort displayed by all sections of the economy and society in keeping foot and mouth disease to one outbreak in the country. The potential of this disease to cause havoc to our agriculture and food industries has become clear to all from the pictures on television screens in recent weeks. While we are endeavouring to facilitate trading in susceptible animals under strict controls, we need to keep uppermost that foot and mouth disease is still a real threat and we have to remain extremely vigilant for a considerable time into the future.</P>
      <P>The people of the Cooley Peninsula have been through an horrendous experience. The farmers have experienced the reality of the culling of their herds. My Department addressed the immediate situation through the establishment of the control centre at Ballymascanlon. There, farmers were able to meet officials directly and quickly about compensation and other arrangements applicable to their circumstances. Farmers have acknowledged the very beneficial support and comfort derived from having a key Department presence on the doorstep and operating around the clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> One of the critical matters yet to be resolved is the question of restocking of farms in County Louth. This must be handled in a phased and controlled manner having regard to the attendant risks. No one will thank us for rushing into a relaxation of restrictions if the consequence is another case of foot and mouth disease, a re-establishment of surveillance and protection zones and a reversal of the tremendous progress made over the past several weeks with the assistance of the people of County Louth and the public generally.</P>
    <P>My Department is examining this aspect, taking account of the differing risks in infected premises and in those associated with them, in commonages, lowland farms into which sheep were moved from the commonages and other lowland farms in the area. I am not yet in a position to provide indicative dates for restocking. This process will be carefully managed on the basis of the best veterinary advice, taking into account the residual risks and balancing the genuine need for the people of County Louth to get back to business with the danger of putting at risk the sacrifices made in recent weeks, not just by the people of County Louth but by all people, through any ill-thought out and precipitate restocking strategy.</P>
    <P>Teagasc, the farm organisations in Louth, and bodies such as Louth Leader continue to apply their resources to supporting and assisting farmers and others in the area. Other Departments and agencies have played their part in bringing helpful and practical information to the attention of farmers and those whose employment has been affected, including the various sources and types of payments potentially available.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in establishing the interdepartmental task force on foot and mouth disease in County Louth. The task force membership also included representatives of local bodies, including the county council, the county enterprise board and Louth Leader. At its meeting on 25 April 2001, the Government noted the report of the task force describing the impact of the crisis in the area, especially in the farming, tourism and trading sectors, and agreed to continue to address urgently the issues raised in the report which are within the remits of a number of Departments. The Government endorsed the proposal to establish a monitoring committee to co-ordinate the follow-up of the task force recommendations at local level under the auspices of Louth local authorities, taking advantage of their strong working relationship with local public service providers and their close contact with the communities in the county which are most affected.</P>
    <P>I realise the foot and mouth disease outbreak has affected all the population of the Cooley Peninsula. As Minister with responsibility for rural development, I am examining ways to ensure rapid economic and social regeneration of this <Col N="1251" /> area and I hope to be able to make an announcement in this regard in the near future. I will take up the Deputy's kind invitation to visit the Cooley Peninsula. I will do that when I have clarified the steps to be taken. It would be important when making such a visit that the type of assistance to be given to the area would be known. Every area has suffered from this crisis in one way or another but the Cooley Peninsula, a rural and geographically isolated community, has suffered more than most. Special steps must taken to regenerate farming in the area and to help the whole community to regenerate itself in the aftermath of the outbreak.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Regulation of Genetic Testing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Irish Insurance Federation to introduce a voluntary code to guard against the use of genetic information in determining eligibility for life insurance is a positive step. However, this move by the industry is by no means a satisfactory tool in insuring that discrimination will not take place on the basis of genetic make up. Moreover, this initiative by the insurance industry should not act as a reason for the Government to be complacent. It is vital that legislation is put in place by the Government to ensure against discrimination on the basis of genetic make up, particularly in the area of life insurance but also in employment opportunities and in accessing credit and other such services.</P>
      <P>Throughout Europe governments are making decisions on whether to legislate for the use of genetic information by insurance companies to determine premiums. Our neighbours in the UK have already agreed to the use of genetic information in the insurance industry and my fear is that without strict legislation here, the use of such information may eventually become a reality in Ireland also.</P>
      <P>While the guidelines by the insurance federation are welcome, they have their limitations. They only apply to people applying for life assurance worth up to £300,000 and not above that limit. In addition, they are voluntary and this is no guarantee against the use of genetic information in determining insurance premiums. Besides, unless we have legislation outlawing the creation of what could become a genetic underclass, discrimination can occur in a whole range of areas such as employment and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications arising from the completion of the human genome this year are being ignored by the Government. While such a breakthrough in determining the mapping of the human genome will have positive outcomes, it is crucial that we keep up to speed on how this information on genetic make up is being used. When the breakthrough came in mapping the human genome I raised the point that the coding of the genome <Col N="1252" /> had the potential for the discrimination of people based on their genetic make up, thus possibly excluding them from employment, preventing them from obtaining insurance, biasing their opportunities for a place in school or affecting their rights in court. On foot of this I wrote to the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology asking him to establish a special committee attached to the Oireachtas to examine developments in genetics and to prepare guidelines for the use of genetic information. To date there have been no moves to convene such a committee despite the fact that one is operational at EU level.</P>
    <P>As politicians we have a responsibility to guard against a genetic underclass arising from this breakthrough in the mapping of the human genome. Insurance companies should not be able to access a person's genetic data. New genetic information should be used for purposes of improving the quality of life and not in order to penalise people because of their genetic inheritance. The use of genetic information by the courts should also be strictly monitored.</P>
    <P>It is now time for this Administration to wake up to the advances which have been made in genetics. Legislation should be framed promptly in relation to the use of genetic information before we reach a situation of mass discrimination of people who are born with genes which could lead to life threatening conditions.</P>
    <P>The mapping of the human genome is very complex and detailed. It has enormous potential, for example in the area of gene therapy, to control and even eliminate some diseases. However, we must ensure that the rights of the individual are not diminished or compromised arising from these developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to set out the position regarding the use of genetic testing, in so far as the health services are concerned and I thank Deputy Upton for raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the National Centre for Medical Genetics has been operating in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, for a number of years. A genetic disorder is any medical disorder which is due to a significant degree to a defect in a gene or group of genes and which may therefore be inherited. Genetic tests use a variety of techniques to determine if a person has a genetic condition or disease or is likely to get the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individuals may wish to be tested if there is a family history of one specific disease, if they show symptoms of a genetic disorder or if they are concerned about passing on a genetic problem to their children. In some cases, the risks of inheriting the gene involved can be accurately specified and the family provided with genetic counselling. It is also possible to identify those family members who are not carriers and so are not at risk of passing on the disorder. I have no <Col N="1253" /> plans at present to introduce statutory regulation of this service.</P>
    <P>In so far as the possible use of genetic testing in relation to private health insurance is concerned, I wish to emphasise that the operation of private health insurance business in this country is subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the Health Insurance Regulations, 1996. These require all health insurers to operate on a community rating and open enrolment basis. The 1994 Act specifically provides that premia payable under health insurance contracts shall not be varied by reference to the suffering or prospective suffering from a chronic disease, illness or other medical condition. The provisions of the legislation provide an effective safeguard to individuals <i>vis-à-vis</i> access to private health insurance in a competitive market. Genetic testing does not therefore arise as an issue, and cannot be used to the detriment of persons insured or seeking cover in that sector.</P>
    <P>The possible use of genetic testing in other areas of insurance does not fall within the administrative remit of the Department of Health and Children. Issues pertaining generally to the regulation and conduct of insurance business in this country are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised from time to time regarding the possible use of genetic manipulation in the context of human reproduction. The potential of science to control or even alter the natural process of the creation of human life raises basic and fundamental ethical questions for the medical profession, the Government and society as a whole.</P>
    <P>In Ireland work in the field of assisted human reproduction is not subject to statutory control. Medical practice is governed by the Medical Council's ethical guidelines. These guidelines apply only in the case of registered medical practitioners and would be ineffective in the case of any service operated by other persons. In order to ensure that a range of concerns about assisted human reproduction are addressed, last year I established an expert commission on assisted human reproduction. The terms of reference of the commission are &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Among the wide range of issues which the commission will be examining is the possible screening of embryos for genetic conditions. It will also consider whether regulation in the whole field of assisted human reproductin is best achieved by legislation or reliance on medical ethics, or a combination of the two.</P>
    <P>The Government will await the commission's report before further considering the question of possible regulation of the whole field of assisted reproduction, of which genetic testing is just one aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> I will reflect on what the Deputy has said to see how best we can progress this important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>This important issue of the level of greenhouse gases which we continue to emit has not been taken seriously and is not being addressed in a meaningful manner. We have, for a long time, been participants in discussions and negotiations on how best to tackle the increasing emissions of these gases which scientists inform us are contributing to global warming and changing weather patterns throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol was agreed in 1997 and ratified by the EU Council of Ministers subsequently. This stated that the EU as a whole would have to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% on 1990 levels by the period 2008 to 2012. The EU as a whole would have to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% on 1990 levels to meet the target in the years 2008-12. Ireland obtained the fourth most generous concession whereby we are allowed a growth limitation target of 13% over 1990 levels. Today, however, we heard that our greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 22% and we have already exceeded our target rate by 9%. If we continue on this basis we will exceed our emissions by up to 40%.</P>
      <P>In his response, I know the Minister will refer to the climate change strategy that was produced last November. I compliment him on that strategy but it took a long time to produce and where is the plan to implement it? Will the Minister leave it to the next Government to resolve these issues after the general election? I read his statement on promoting the strategy which is described as a radical blueprint. The Minister said the Government will move into the implementation phase immediately by establishing a cross-departmental climate change team but is the strategy stuck in consultation between committees and interdepartmental groups? </P>
      <P>At the time, the Minister said he would run a special campaign to promote awareness and underline the need for support for the strategy. It was considered so urgent and important that it needed to be implemented immediately but where is this process now, seven months later? Both the Minister and the Minister of State have said publicly that we have totally failed to uncouple economic growth and energy consumption. Already, however, it looks as if our interim targets set for the year 2005 will not be met. Is it possible to meet them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent announcement by the United States that it will pull out of the Kyoto Protocol, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, was quick to take action in instructing our ambassador in Washington to let the American authorities know we were concerned about the decision. Today, however, we heard the embarrassing revelation that Ireland is one of the worst offenders in <Col N="1255" /> Europe when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas Ceann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter, and I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, for attending the House to respond. The situation is very serious. We have had strategies, statements, and well-meaning proposals to deal with greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. So far, however, we have not seen anything concrete. Today came the embarrassing revelation that Ireland has already exceeded its target greenhouse gas emission rates for 2010. We will certainly not meet our targets under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for tabling this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me an opportunity to respond to the points she has raised. Ireland's emissions of greenhouse gases are currently more than 20% above 1990 levels and are projected to rise by up to 37% above 1990 levels by 2010, if we do not take action. In common with most other countries, it has always been recognised that we would initially exceed our target, just as we recognised that in order to represent meaningful action, our target must represent a significant move away from &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;. Implementation of the Government's national climate change strategy will reduce annual emissions by 15 million tonnes C02 equivalent, enough to ensure we meet our target by 2008 to 2012.</P>
      <P>The rapid increase in emissions is a result of Ireland's sustained economic growth throughout the 1990s from a relatively low economic base in 1990. While this growth has generated additional emissions of greenhouse gases, the EPA's &ldquo;Millennium State of the Environment&rdquo; report shows that there has been a relative uncoupling between GDP growth and most environmental indicators. We must now intensify this uncoupling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister published his strategy last November, significant progress has been made. <Col N="1256" /> The necessary institutional structures to drive forward its implementation have been established. A high level cross-departmental climate change team now meets regularly to ensure that all areas of Government work in partnership to meet our Kyoto target. A consultation process ensures that key sectoral interests are informed of progress and can factor in climate change considerations and forthcoming policies and measures into their planning processes. Work is also under way on the development of a long-term communications strategy addressing awareness of climate change. Comhar has submitted proposals for this and we are working to put it in place.</P>
    <P>The national climate change strategy also agreed to put in place an appropriate framework for greenhouse gas taxation, prioritising C02 emissions from 2002 on a phased incremental basis. We remain committed to delivering on this measure. As provided for in the strategy, measures will be developed in a balanced manner so that they are broadly fiscally neutral and provide new incentives, for example towards energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>Many measures have already been taken by this Government. In recent weeks full market access has been granted to electricity from combined heat and power, the most efficient of all forms of generation. A new renewable energy competition will be announced shortly, a key measure to bring renewable electricity generation to 500 megawatts by 2005. Staff in the Irish Energy Centre are being doubled to oversee a £23 million spend on promoting energy efficient housing and a £40 million spend on research and development for energy conservation. Afforestation grants and amounts of premium payments were increased by 30% last year. We are also advancing the national development plan investment programme in public transport: five quality bus corridors were opened recently, and Luas is ahead of schedule.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to ensuring that we meet our Kyoto target in an economically efficient manner so that we in Ireland can make our contribution to tackling the most serious global environmental challenge.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 9 May 2001.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department's consideration of the advice received from the Chief State Solicitor's office has yet concluded regarding Iarnród Éireann's work at Killiney Beach, County Dublin; if it is now intended to initiate prosecutions against Iarnród Éireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that last January Iarnród Éireann commenced emergency repair work at Killiney to prevent the railway line from being undermined by the action of the sea. This work necessitated trespass on the foreshore and the temporary occupation of Killiney Beach. My Department was made aware last November that Iarnród Éireann proposed to carry out works at this spot and would, in due course, apply for a foreshore licence to allow the carrying out of the works. No such application was made and the first notice my Department received was through complaints being made by residents. The issue was immediately raised with Iarnród Éireann which responded that, under its legislation, no permission was required for emergency works.</P>
      <P>There was a lack of clarity as to whether the railways legislation took precedence over the Foreshore Acts and my Department sought the advice of the Attorney General, according to whom the legislation governing the maintenance of the railways has precedence over the Foreshore Acts in the case of works of an urgent nature which are essential for the safety of the public. I am satisfied that such a situation has arisen in this case and that a prosecution would not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may well ask why, given that Iarnród Éireann had planned for some months that it would undertake these works, it did not make application for a foreshore licence in the normal course. I can only surmise that the company considered that the built-in delays which examination in my Department and public consultation would involve would lead to an unacceptable delay and that the railway would either collapse or have to be closed. My Department is, at the highest level, in communication with Iarnród Éireann to ascertain details of any other urgent works involving foreshore which will <Col N="1258" /> require a departure from the normal application of the Foreshore Acts and to set in place appropriate arrangements for ensuring that the public is made aware in advance of the intention to undertake the works in question and that the site is properly managed and vacated in a proper state after the works have been completed. Such works are an exception rather than the rule and in the normal course the provisions of the Foreshore Acts take precedence in the case of railway works involving foreshore. Iarnród Éireann has assured my Department that it will apply for a foreshore licence to undertake the essential permanent works at Killiney Beach and prior discussions have taken place on this matter already.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in a reply on 20 March to a similar question raised by the Deputy, there were developments in relation to the Corrib gas accumulation. Enterprise Energy Ireland declared the Corrib gas field commercial in January this year, on behalf of its co-venturers Statoil and Marathon, and have applied to me for a lease for its development which my Department is at present considering and evaluating.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expects the field to be in production for about 15 years. There will be a substantial increase this year in offshore drilling activity with up to five exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited recently drilled an exploration well in the Rockall Trough which has now been plugged and abandoned. Exploration wells will also be drilled by Statoil and EDC in the Porcupine and Fastnet basins respectively. Subject to availability of a drilling rig, Ramco Oil and Gas also proposes to drill one or two exploration wells in the Celtic Sea. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited also proposes to drill a further appraisal well in the Corrib gas field and two development wells will be drilled by Marathon in the south-west Kinsale area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, well commitments beyond 2001 only amount to between three and six for the entire Irish offshore. In addition, the number of offshore exploration licences has fallen to 20 compared to a peak of 32 in 1997 while a number of exploration companies granted licences under the 1997 licensing round have indicated their intention to relinquish these licences this year. As regards the onshore, the position is that two licensing options are currently held over parts of the north-west Carboniferous Basin. The licensed area comprises lands in Counties Sligo, Leitrim, <Col N="1259" /> Roscommon, Cavan and Monaghan, and I understand that there is likely to be an application to drill at least one well in this area in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor, Deputy Woods, initiated discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are chaired by my Department and are ongoing.</P>
      <P>Exploration and production companies employ Irish workers in offshore exploration and development, particularly in the Kinsale gas field. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate fully in such activities and I will continue to do so. In an address to the Institute of Petroleum last November I made it clear that the Government does not expect the industry to avail of Irish goods, services or employment where these are clearly not competitive but it does expect the industry to encourage and facilitate potential Irish suppliers to compete for the services required. This should be done in partnership with State agencies and should be seen as part of the industry's commitment to Ireland, within a long-term commercial and marketing framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any company operating in Ireland for the long term should see that it is in its own best commercial interest to build strong links into the Irish economy and to demonstrate a significant economic and social dividend both at regional and national level. The discussions being facilitated by my Department, IOOA and FÁS, in consultation with SIPTU, have established a procedure to identify suitably qualified personnel who wished to be considered for any specific vacancies for work both in the development of the Corrib field and in the Irish offshore. This procedure was advertised recently by FÁS in the national press and 83 applications were received, including 38 seeking work on rigs. Of these, 30 applicants, and a further 30 who had not applied but who showed up at the interviews, were interviewed by Transocean-Sedco-Forex, rig contractors, in Cork and Limerick in March. Offers of employment have <Col N="1260" /> been made to 38 personnel, who are both experienced and trained, and of these 34 have accepted and are undergoing induction training in Cork.</P>
    <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland has the co-operation of the Irish Offshore Operators Association and individual operators to ensure that there is early notification of future offshore work to potential Irish suppliers. I am glad to say that the Irish Offshore Operators Association is committed to fully support these opportunities and I understand that both Irish and Norwegian contractors are having difficulty finding qualified and available seagoing personnel for standby-supply vessels, nevertheless, the sole available Irish contractor has obtained about one third of the available business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 March this year, I published the official report of the investigation into the collision between the British registered fishing vessel <i>Sea Horse</i> and the Irish fishing vessel <i>Exodus</i> which occurred on 9 March 1997 and which resulted in the sinking of <i>Exodus</i> and the death of her skipper, Mr. Daniel O'Driscoll. I take this opportunity to once again express my sincere sympathy to the relatives and friends of Mr. O'Driscoll.</P>
      <P>The official report sets out fully the sequence of events which led to the collision and the subsequent attempt to rescue the crew of the <i>Exodus</i>. In summary, at the time of the collision the <i>Sea Horse</i>, which had its autopilot engaged, was attempting to overtake the <i>Exodus</i>. The Sea Horse suddenly swung rapidly to port towards the <i>Exodus</i>. The skipper of the <i>Sea Horse</i> changed from autopilot to tiller steering and put the rudder hard over to starboard and at the same time stopped the engines and put them full astern. The vessel did not answer the helm and the <i>Sea Horse</i> struck the <i>Exodus</i> on her starboard side a little forward of her wheelhouse breaching her hull from deck level to below the waterline. The <i>Exodus</i> foundered following the collision. All three members of her crew were picked up from the water by the <i>Sea Horse</i>&ndash; two deckhands from a life raft and the Skipper, Mr. Daniel O'Driscoll. Mr. O'Driscoll was subsequently airlifted to Cork Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The master of the <i>Sea Horse</i> appeared before Bantry District Court on 11 April 1997. He was charged under section 419(2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, with an infringement of the Collision Regulations (Ship and Water Craft on the Water) Order, 1984, as amended, in that he failed to ensure that his vessel kept out of the way of a vessel engaged in fishing as required by Rule <Col N="1261" /> 18(a)(iii) of the regulations. He pleaded guilty and was fined £750 with £250 costs.</P>

The primary purpose of the Act is to provide for the enactment of a new legislative and procedural regime to regulate the entire area of marine casualty investigation which will replace the system established in 1894. A key provision of the Act is the establishment of an independent Marine Casualty Investigation Board with enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties and to publish reports within a specified timetable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 66 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>The current licensing terms were very carefully designed and introduced in 1992 to compensate for Ireland's disadvantage in terms of perceived prospectivity and operating conditions and to encourage interest in exploration and development. Only two exploration wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore in the last three years, despite the existence of the 1992 terms and there are 20 offshore exploration licences in place at present compared to a peak of 32 in 1997. Furthermore, a number of exploration companies granted licences under a licensing round in 1997 have indicated their intention to relinquish these licences this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that Irish prospectivity is low and is not comparable with our oil producing neighbours. We have only had three successful exploration wells out of 123 wells in 30 years while over the same period the United Kingdom has drilled about 3,000 wells of which about 250 <Col N="1262" /> are in production. In the light of these factors, it is premature to consider changing our terms and, though I intend to keep them under continuing review, such a debate at this time is not justified by our record of prospectivity. It would send the wrong signals to the industry at a time when we need to encourage an increase in the level of exploration. There is, of course, no question of amending the application of the terms in respect of exploration licences already issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a thorough examination of the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into Accident DH 248/Rescue 111 Tramore, 2 July 1999, took place in my Department. The following is an update on the response of my Department to the recommendations which relate specifically to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. It follows the numbering set out in the report:</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.14. (S.R. 24 of 2000). My Department has in place training programmes for Coast Guard units in dealing with hazardous situations. This training is being upgraded in the case of incidents of serious aircraft accidents. On 14 October 2000, the chief fire officer at Shannon Airport delivered a lecture on the subject of downed aircraft search and approach techniques at the coast guard area officers' annual conference in Limerick. I plan to make this lecture a regular part of training personnel in relation to downed aircraft situations.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.15. (S.R. 25 of 2000). My Department accepts the need for formalising current relationships and such agreements are at draft stage at present.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.16. (S.R. 26 of 2000). My Department in its contract relationships with private operators ensures that appropriate agreements to the Department's satisfaction are in place between service providers and airport authorities. It should be noted that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is not a party to relationships between the Air Corps and airport authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendation 4.21. (S.R. 31 of 2000). My Department has an ongoing training and review programme in place which encompasses, <i>inter alia</i>, aviation awareness. <Col N="1263" /> Twelve staff have attended two three-week search and rescue mission co-ordinator's courses to date and a two day aviation awareness module was introduced on the course.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.22. (S.R. 32 of 2000). The maritime circumstances that gave rise to the rescue mission are well known and documented. Unfortunately such circumstances are all too common despite continuing intensive media and publicity campaigns led by my Department assisted by the RNLI, Irish Water Safety, the Civil Defence, CIL and sporting, fishing and various representative organisations. The chief marine surveyor has advised that a formal investigation is not required as all the details are already available. The level of call-out to assist leisure craft in difficulty is more than 300 annually and a key aim of my Department is to bring about a fundamental change in safety culture.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.25. (S.R. 35 of 2000). My Department has to be satisfied when taking on private contractors that they will be fully capable and proficient in providing the required service from date of contract. The relationship with the Air Corps is not a contractual one and the matter of proficiency of crews and assets is primarily for the military authorities.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in replies to similar questions raised in the House on 8 February and 21 March, there will be a substantial increase this year in offshore drilling activity with at least three exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited recently drilled an exploration well in the Rockall Trough but it has now been plugged and abandoned. It is expected that further exploration wells will be drilled by Statoil and EDC in the Porcupine and Fastnet basins respectively. Subject to availability of a drilling rig, Ramco Oil and Gas also proposes to drill one or two exploration wells in the Celtic Sea.

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, well commitments beyond 2001 only amount to between three and six for the entire Irish offshore and with that in mind I established an initiative aimed at conserving certain areas of the Irish offshore by closing them off from <Col N="1264" /> development for the moment and gauging interest on the part of the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas. To that end, I have undertaken a consultation process involving companies who are licence holders here in order to gauge their view on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licences might be offered and this process is ongoing.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to a report published in <i>The Veterinary Record</i> of 6 June 1998. In 1995 and 1996 cataract problems developed in Irish farmed salmon and the affected fish had reduced growth rates and poor body condition. Research and clinical trials, here and in Norway, linked the problem to a deficiency of riboflavin in the dietary mix and this problem was subsequently remedied by the feed manufacturers. While the fish posed no threat to public health by entering the food chain, the physical condition of the fish was poor and consequently badly affected fish produced during the 1995 and 1996 cycles were sold as production grade fish. The dietary condition which caused their downgrading was due solely to the chemical composition of the feed and was not linked to either animal or human pathogens. In most recent years cataracts in farmed fish has not been a problem.</P>

      <P>Current stringent management practices and controls governing the operation of fish farms are kept under continuous review in line with our policy objective for the sustainable development of aquaculture. In May 2000 I intro<Col N="1265" /> duced five new aquaculture protocols with the support of the fish farming industry as part of an overall strategy to support the highest environmental standards for the Irish aquaculture sector. The Protocols have been welcomed by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation, an international body whose remit is the conservation and protection of wild salmon stocks in the north Atlantic region, and one of them relates to the sealice monitoring and control, where experience gained over the past decade has enabled Ireland to become a world leader in the development of sealice management and control strategies.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to inform the House that I have recently established a group to review the current status of sea trout stocks throughout the mid-western sea trout fisheries area, including examining the operation and management of fish counters and traps on key sea trout catchments with a view to improving data collection generally on stock levels. I have also asked the group to consider ways in which local aquaculture operators and sport fishery operators can liaise and co-operate on an ongoing basis through the linking of co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems and the catchment management process and establish a pilot project to further this objective.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I announced on Friday, 6 April that I had secured the agreement of the authorities at the UK ports, which service vehicle and passenger routes to Ireland, to the installation of automatic vehicle spraying equipment for all vehicles embarking for Ireland. The ports involved were Liverpool, Holyhead, Heysham, Fishguard and Swansea. At our request the port authority at Pembroke agreed to adjust the systems in place. The spraying equipment was delivered and installed to the five UK ports over a seven day period from 20 April and the total cost of its installation was in the region of £105,000, which will be funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. No contribution towards the cost has been sought from the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to confirm that spraying facilities are now in place and are fully operational. The move to put in automatic spraying, paid for by Ireland, is not to be taken as a criticism of disinfection procedures in UK ports, in fact, the UK was required under EU law to put in place disinfection procedures. However, we decided that more effective spraying facilities, not required under EU law, would better protect us. We do business with UK ports every day and port authorities on both sides of the Irish Sea have excellent working relations. The decision to pay for these facilities, which was fully endorsed by the Government and the FMD task force, reflects the fact that it is the island of Ireland that will benefit. The consequences for Ireland of infectivity crossing the Irish Sea are so great that the highest quality disinfection procedures are clearly warranted and this is a proactive approach to assist and complement the stringent precautions already in place and also to support shipping operations.</P>

      <P>While the responsibility for the configuration of distribution gas pipelines is a matter for commercial decision by An Bord Gáis and the Minister for Public Enterprise, I have been pursuing, and will continue to pursue with them, the question of having as many major towns as can be reached within BGE's commercial mandate connected to the natural gas network and to press for maximum availability of gas to areas which have currently been excluded. BGE is already <Col N="1267" /> committed to connecting the natural gas network to as many towns as can be reached within their commercial mandate.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing a gas supply to certain towns in the catchment area of the proposed pipeline and spur-line, BGE is examining the prospect of supplying gas to other centres of population in the north-west as part of a national study to determine centres that can be supplied with gas on an economic basis and when this assessment has been completed, a fuller picture as to the costs and viability of such extensions will emerge. The Government recently gave approval in principle for the construction of spur pipelines to the northwest of Ireland while recognising that State funding will be required as BGE has a statutory obligation to extend gas networks to new areas of supply on a commercial basis only. My priority is to see the extension of the gas network and a new supply off the west coast used to accelerate economic development in the Border, midland and western regions.</P>

      <P>The present position is that an Alouette 111 single-engined helicopter is based at Waterford and this aircraft, because of its visual contact flight conditions, daylight only restricted range, is not particularly suited for offshore marine emergency helicopter cover. It is, however, well suited for mountain, cliff and close-in marine search and rescue operations conducted by daylight in visual contact flight conditions. As the Deputy will be aware, the Alouette replaces, on a temporary basis, the Dauphin which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to urgently upgrade the current unsuitable SAR helicopter service in Waterford and have pursued with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, how this might be achieved. I am happy to say that we have commenced negotiations on a contract for the early provision of a new dedicated all weather, night flying, medium-lift helicopter capacity at Waterford. This provision will be an interim arrangement pending a more permanent placing of a fully suitable service in Waterford. The Department has also commenced the contract procedures for the acquisition on contract of the latter service and, though I am not in a position at the moment to put any precise date on when the replacement will be in place, it is my hope that this can be achieved later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board regarding the use of fertilisers by Coillte Teoranta. The board's concerns arise largely from an incident in the Ballycastle area of County Mayo in July 2000 where Coillte Teoranta applied fertiliser by air to a site. It is worth noting that the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board approved of the aerial fertilisation project which it is now acknowledged caused a degree of damage to adjacent watercourses. My Department was not directly involved in this matter but subsequently an Inspector from its forest service investigated and reported on it. This report concluded that this site was not suited to the aerial method of fertilisation and a more conventional method of fertilisation should have been employed. The forest service plans to publish aerial fertilisation for forestry guidelines by December 31 2001 which will augment the current forestry and water quality guidelines as well as the code of best forest practice, copies of which have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The aerial fertilisation guidelines will represent best practice in this sensitive area and will limit aerial fertilisation to suitable sites where aquatic zones are not threatened. In addition, my Department plans to develop guidelines on phosphorous application which will cover fertiliser application. The production of these guidelines will involve consultation with interested parties including Coillte and the fisheries boards. Compliance with the guidelines will be a condition of grant aid and of the issue of a felling licence. My Department's forestry schemes, procedures and standards manual and code of best forest practice provide specific details on how fertiliser application should be carried out and penalties are provided for under the Department's schemes for non-compliance with these requirements. My Department's forest service inspectors visit sites and issue binding recommendations in relation to the application of fertiliser.</P>

      <P>The <i>City of Cork</i> was detained as a result of inspections jointly carried out by my Department's marine survey office and the United Kingdom's Maritime and Coastguard Agency in accordance with my Department's practice of inspecting all passenger ferries operating to this country and in compliance with the European directive on inspection of such vessels. These inspections cover not only the ship and its equipment, but also the crew's qualifications, competence and ability to deal with emergencies in accordance with the standards laid down in the relevant international conventions.</P>
      <P>In the case of <i>City of Cork</i>, after a number of drills had been jointly carried out by the MSO and the MCA in Cork, it was agreed that some further training was necessary and that further drills would be held in Swansea. While undergoing these further drills in Swansea certain language difficulties were revealed with a small but critical number of the ship's crew. The vessel was detained by the MCA in Swansea, with the involvement and agreement of the MSO, until such time as its owners had replaced the crew members concerned and was released from Swansea when the MCA was satisfied with the new crew. When the vessel returned to Cork it was again inspected by surveyors from the MSO and further drills carried out until they were satisfied that any crew deficiencies had been rectified.</P>

      <P>Effective arrangements and procedures for the integrated management of the coastal zone, embracing close co-operation with all relevant public bodies, are essential. Priority has been given in recent years to the introduction of new legislation and frameworks in relation to, <i>inter alia</i>, planning and development, aquaculture regulation and dumping at sea, as well as local initiatives such as the Bantry Bay coastal zone charter and co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems. The way is becoming clear to bring forward new frameworks which will focus on the interaction between different sectors, agencies and legal structures with a view to creating a more integrated and holistic approach to coastal zone management.

Sacrifices have been made in the national interest throughout the country and, though we must remain vigilant against the threat of the disease, I am hopeful angling is now well placed to regain momentum and the remainder of the season will make up for difficulties experienced in the last few months.</P>

      <P>Dumping of toxic and radioactive waste is prohibited under the Sea Pollution Acts and my Department is not aware of any such dumping taking place in Irish water. The Irish marine environment is, however, contaminated by radioactive discharges from nuclear installations in the UK.</P>
      <P>Discharges of radioactive waste from the British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing plant at Sellafield continue to be the dominant source of radioactive contamination of the marine environment. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities, carries out a marine radioactivity monitoring programme throughout the year. The primary objective of the ongoing monitoring programme is to assess the exposure of the Irish population resulting from radioactive contamination of the Irish marine environment. That involves the routine sampling and testing of radioactivity in fish, shellfish, seaweed, sediments and sea water and the RPII publishes the results of its programme, which include levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea, in a series of marine monitoring reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent of these reports covering the years 1998 and 1999 is available on the RPII's website at www.rpii.ie which it updates with data on a quarterly basis. Arising from its marine monitoring programme, it is the view of the RPII that the doses received by the Irish public through the consumption of seafood, walking on the beaches or engaging in any other marine-based activity are low and do not constitute a significant health risk. Nevertheless, as my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, who has responsibility for nuclear safety and radiological protection, has advised the House on numerous occasions, the continued contamination of the Irish marine <Col N="1274" /> environment from the Sellafield plant is totally unacceptable and the Government continues to maintain the maximum pressure on the UK authorities for the cessation of nuclear reprocessing activities and of radioactive discharges.</P>

      <P>The task force in question was established under the chairmanship of Dr. John Mangan to advise me on transport logistics in connection with ports. It will examine the potential for, and prospects of, increasing the volume of port traffic transported by rail and the transfer of port generated freight traffic from road to rail. This will include the development of rail head facilities at existing ports, transport of freight across transport modes by night and traffic diversion by rail and pipeline, including relocation of oil tank farms, to other less congested ports outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>The task force will also seek to identify other imaginative proposals to reduce congestion and make port access and egress more efficient. It will identify cost effective options for the movement of port-related traffic through Dublin and the possibility of transferring non-essential activities away from the commercial sector. In addition to these specific tasks, the group will be free to advise on any aspects of transport logistics in connection with ports which they feel merits comment and will take into account various reports and international experience. In an effort to consult as widely as possible, it has placed advertisements in the national media inviting submissions from interested parties.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, a figure of IR£20 million over the seven-year period has been allocated to the marine tourism and leisure sector. Of this, £14 million has been allocated to the Border, midlands and western region, and £6 million to the south and eastern regions.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the marine tourism grant scheme will be to improve marine tourism access infrastructure and to encourage integrated development and co-operative partnerships, particularly concerning networks and clusters.</P>

      <P>In addition to discussing environmental aspects of fisheries policy, the Fisheries Council received an initial presentation from Commissioner Fischler on the green paper recently produced by the Commission on reform of the Common Fisheries Policy &ndash; CPF. This represented the start of the political debate on CFP Review 2002.</P>
      <P>I stressed that the Green Paper, as a discussion document, should stimulate a real and wide-ranging debate on the key challenges and future directions for the CFP. Commissioner Fischler indicated at Council his intention to encourage genuine dialogue and consultations with all the stakeholders over the coming months. This approach is to be welcomed. There will be a substantial debate on CFP reform at the next EU Fisheries Council in June. My initial reaction is to welcome the fact that a number of areas that Ireland has identified as priorities are reflected in the Commission's thinking. These include the need for enhanced conservation strategies; fleet policy which delivers sustainable balance between fishing and resources; more involvement of the industry and other stakeholders; regional advisory mechanisms; and fisheries control that is cost effective, transparent and equitable.</P>
      <P>The Council also considered a number of specific initiatives to achieve increased sustainability of fish stocks. These include, in particular, a strategy for the integration of environment considerations into the Common Fisheries Policy proposals for setting total allowable fish catches and quotas on a multi-annual basis. This should permit a more effective application of precautionary fisheries management principles and techniques.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>Given the impact of forestry on the landscape, in terms of aesthetics, environment and culture, measures are required that ensure overall positive results and avoidance of damage. For this reason, my Department has published guidelines on forestry and the landscape. I am placing a copy of the guidelines in the Oireachtas library.</P>
      <P>The guidelines specifically address forestry on mountainsides and provide recommendations for this and various other forest-development scenarios. The guidelines apply to all grant-aided projects and to all activities associated with a felling licence.</P>
      <P>The objective of these guidelines is to ensure a positive relationship between the forest and the character of a given landscape as a whole &ndash; in other words, to achieve a balance of land cover.</P>

      <P>Investment strategies to support the modernisation of the Irish whitefish fleet are designed to enhance the safety, quality and competitiveness of the fleet. It is the case that increases in catching efficiency will tend to be combined with a degree of rationalisation in overall capacity and participation rates. This trend should contribute to the longer-term viability of the commercial whitefish sector, subject to the state of fish stocks. Overall modernisation of the whitefish fleet should not in itself result in declines in employment in the sector. Conversely, very significant labour shortages have developed in the fishing sector and one of the key objectives of the modernisation programme is to enhance the attractiveness of the sector for new entrants and to retain existing crews.</P>

      <P>The social economy programme was launched in September 2000. A monitoring committee, representative of relevant Departments and the social partners, has been established and has agreed the operational framework for the programme. More than 20.3 million &ndash; IR£16 million &ndash; is provided for the programme in 2001 and a total of 270.5 million &ndash; IR£213 million &ndash; up to 2006 under the national development plan. Up to 2,500 jobs are targeted to be created by 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local working groups have been established by FÁS in consultation with area partnership companies to draw up an agreed local strategy for the development of the programme. This includes the identification and prioritisation of new and innovative sectors of work activity where social economy enterprises will support the economic and social regeneration of the locality. Fifty-one local working groups have been established to date. <Col N="1282" /> Former community employment projects are eligible to apply for and be considered for approval as social economy enterprises as envisaged under the social economy programme. FÁS would be happy to encourage community employment projects and persons in relation to applications under the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>An employee's eligibility for labour law protection depends on the individual's employment status. Under recent employment legislation, that is the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, &ldquo;employee&rdquo; means &ldquo;a person of any age, who has entered into or works under (or, where the employment has ceased, entered into or worked under) a contract of employment.&rdquo;. &ldquo;Contract of employment&rdquo; means &ldquo;(a) a contract of service or apprenticeship and (b) any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person, who is carrying on the business of an employment agency within the meaning of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, and is acting in the course of that business, to do or perform personally any work or service for a third party, whether or not the third party is a party to the contract.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour law regulates aspects of the employer-employee relationship where persons are employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, including persons on fixed-term and fixed-purpose contracts. As a rule, persons engaged under a contract for services are regarded as, in effect, self-employed and, as such, would fall outside the scope of labour law protection. In cases of dispute or doubt, determination as to whether any individual falls within the scope of labour law protection is a matter for the relevant adjudicative authority, for example, rights commissioner, employment appeals tribunal, or, as appropriate, the courts, in the light of the circumstances of a particular case. In this regard, the <Col N="1283" /> nature of the contract between the parties would be a central consideration.</P>
    <P>Where an employee is employed under a contract of service, the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, provides for written statements of terms of employment. Section 3(1) of the Act provides as follows:</P>
    <P>An employer shall, not later than two months after the commencement of an employee's employment with the employer, give or cause to be given to the employee a statement in writing containing the following particulars of the terms of the employee's employment . . .</P>
    <P>Section 3(1)(a) to (m) sets out the particulars required in that statement.</P>
    <P>Under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, section 19, an employee is entitled to annual leave calculated as follows: (a) four working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment; or (b) one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works 117 hours; or (c) 8% of the hours he or she works in a leave year but subject to a maximum of four working weeks.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Act also provides that employees are entitled to nine public holidays during the leave year. The employer determines that an employee is entitled, in respect of a public holiday, to one of the following four alternatives: (a) a paid day off on that day; (b) a paid day off within a month of that day; (c) an additional day of annual leave; (d) an additional day's pay.</P>
    <P>If an employer refuses to grant an employee his/her annual leave or public holiday entitlement, the employee may refer a complaint to a rights commissioner for redress.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of other aspects of labour law legislation administered by my Department rests with the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and my labour inspectors. Full details of the remedies available to employees in cases of employer default, which vary under individual pieces of legislation, may be obtained by contacting the employment rights information unit of my Department at (01) 631 3131 or on Lo-call 1890 220222, where staff will be happy to assist.

      <P>The Department currently has 69 vacancies, none of which have been vacant for more than one year. Vacant positions are not filled by persons in an acting capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department runs regular internal promotion competitions to fill vacancies. In addition, the Department is in regular contact with the Civil Service Commission regarding recruitment issues and to ensure that vacancies are filled as soon as possible. The Civil Service Commission recruits through open competitions and has established panels for all grades from which assignments are made to each Government Department. Twenty-five assignments have been made to the Department by the Civil Service <Col N="1285" /> Commission and these are expected to take up duty in the next few weeks. None of the vacancies in the Department is impacting on the implementation of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In line with other Departments, the Department offers flexible work arrangements such as parental leave, career breaks, job-sharing, term-time and flexible working hours to members of staff. The Department also established a work options unit on 1 March 2001 to promote other family friendly initiatives which will be coming on stream in the coming months. The provision of ongoing staff training and development together with educational support are central to enhancing the skills and competencies of staff. These initiatives are core elements in attracting and retaining staff in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, provide that a foreshore lease or licence may be granted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources if he is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so. Each application is considered on its merits following public consultation and consultation with relevant experts. Where it is decided to grant a foreshore lease or licence, appropriate conditions are attached. Examples of grounds for refusing to grant a foreshore lease or licence would be to avoid unnecessary occupation of foreshore by a proliferation of individual outfall pipes or moorings where a community-based arrangement would better serve the public interest, or to prevent unacceptable environmental consequences.</P>
      <P>Section 10 of that Act as amended provides that the Minister shall not refuse to approve proposals for structures on foreshore which is not State-owned, except where such structures would be, or would cause or be likely to cause directly or indirectly, an obstruction to navigation or to fishing or would have, or be likely to have, adverse effects on the environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 120 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department in the area of maritime safety is primarily to formulate policy and to introduce legislation to ensure that the highest national and international safety standards. In addition, my Department's marine safety working group has the responsibility of increasing awareness of water-based safety, mainly by the dissemination of safety guidelines to mariners and media safety campaigns.</P>
      <P>As regards seagoing passenger and cargo vessels, my aim is to ensure that the appropriate regulatory framework is in place to ensure that all Irish registered vessels operating to and from Ireland and vessels using our ports are constructed, maintained and operated to the highest international safety standards, which are derived from the safety conventions of the International Maritime Organisation and from initiatives at EU level. I am pleased to say that Ireland is at the forefront in promoting improved safety standards for international shipping. My Department participates in the relevant International Maritime Organisation and EU committees, which develop new standards and legislation, and continually updates our maritime law to ensure that all the resulting EU directives and International Maritime Organisation safety conventions and resolutions are fully implemented.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of all regulations is carried out by the marine survey office of my Department, which inspects vessels to ensure that they are complying with the safety standards laid down.</P>

      <P>As part of a range of measures taken to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease to the State, my Department wrote to all the regional fisheries boards at the start of March notifying that eel fishing should cease until further notice and asking the boards to inform eel fishing licence holders. This measure, together with the nationwide prohibition of angling, was taken following consultation with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and was in line with measures adopted by the Government acting with the greatest degree of caution commensurate with the risk of an outbreak of this very serious disease in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following on the advice of the expert group in relation to foot and mouth disease controls, my Department wrote again on 12 April to all the regional fisheries boards informing them that eel fishing could resume subject to compliance with stated guidelines. The guidelines allowed for the resumption of eel fishing subject to fishermen not entering on to land to which animals of susceptible species may have had access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding eel fishing and foot and mouth disease controls is now further improved. Last week, I announced that, with effect from 11 May, access to agricultural land by fishermen is permissible subject to precautionary measures. In particular, contact with susceptible animals must be avoided and footwear and clothing should be cleaned and disinfected before and after use. I made this announcement following the most recent recommendations of the expert group. In <Col N="1288" /> effect, from 11 May, normal commercial eel fishing activity will be possible throughout the country subject to the stated precautions. The regional boards have been requested by my Department to inform eel fishermen of the current position.</P>

      <P>Irish fishermen are showing an increasing interest in deepwater species and, in <Col N="1289" /> the year 2000, the deepwater fisheries programme undertaken by BIM involved ten vessels, including six of the new vessels introduced under the whitefish renewal scheme. The main species include black scabbard, grenadier, sika shark, greenland halibut, redfish, forkbeard, blue ling and tusk with smaller quantities of orange roughy, red scorpion fish, rabbitfish, cardinal fish and argentines. Approximately 700 tonnes of non-quota deepwater species were landed during the BIM deepwater fisheries programme. Additional landings of demersal deepwater species were made outside the BIM programme. A total of 2,000 tonnes, including ling, were landed by demersal Irish Sea fishing vessels during 2000.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I established the task force on transport logistics under the chairmanship of Dr. John Mangan to advise me on transport logistics in connection with ports. The task force will examine the potential and prospects for the following: increasing the volume of port traffic that is transported by rail and the transfer of port-generated freight traffic from road to rail, including the development of railhead facilities at existing ports; transport of freight across transport modes by night or during off-peak hours; for traffic diversion. The latter includes diversion by rail, by pipeline including relocation of oil tank farms and to other less congested ports outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>The task force will also seek to: identify other imaginative proposals to reduce congestion and make port access-egress more efficient; identify cost-effective options for the movement of port-related traffic through Dublin; identify the possibility for transfer of non-essential activities away from ports.</P>
      <P>In addition to these specific tasks, the group will be free to advise on any aspects of the transport logistics of ports that they feel merit comment. This group will take into account various reports and international experience.

      <P>In 1999, it was agreed in principle that the current responsibility of the Irish Coast Guard for marine emergencies be extended to encompass emergencies occurring in inland rivers, lakes and waterways. My Department is currently engaging in consultation with other State agencies and local interests with a view to developing, costing and implementing the necessary planning, communications and operational infrastructure to bring inland emergency response up to the current high standards of marine emergency response. This work is ongoing.</P>
      <P>At present, the Irish Coast Guard of my Department provides members of the Community Inshore Rescue Service with a grant in aid of £2,500 per annum along with training courses, safety inspections/audits and standard operational procedures provided they comply with certain criteria set down for such rescue groups. At present, membership of the Community Inshore Rescue Service is comprised of coastal response organisations. However, consideration is being given to enlarging the Community Inshore Rescue Service on foot of the Government decision on the Irish Coast Guard's extended responsibility. I am arranging for my Department to send the Deputy a copy of the Irish water safety booklet entitled &ldquo;Guidelines for the Establishment of Community Inshore Rescue Stations in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is currently no fund available to support groups such as Carrick-on-Suir River Rescue Group other than the ongoing grant-in-aid mentioned above. I have asked my Department to consider setting up such a fund. However, in the meantime the Deputy should examine the above mentioned booklet with a view to assessing how and/or whether he would wish to apply to join the Community Inshore Rescue Service. I will reply to the Deputy as soon as possible in relation to the question of a fund and any relevant qualifying requirements.</P>

      <P>My Department has always taken a full and active part both at EU and international level in relation to the prevention of pollution at sea.</P>
      <P>The <i>Erika</i> incident, which occurred in December 1999, has served to focus the minds of concerned parties in all countries on the importance of effective measures.</P>
      <P>The increased awareness that has occurred has led to the agreement at the marine environment protection committee of the International Maritime Organisation, in which Department officials participated, on the phasing out of certain single-hulled tankers by 2015 in favour of double-hulled types.</P>
      <P>In general, during the past 20 years or so, since the introduction of the International Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution &ndash; MARPOL &ndash; to which Ireland is a party, there has been a marked reduction in the pollution resulting from operational activities of ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the EU directive on port state control inspections, officers of the Department inspect foreign vessels, including tankers, entering our ports, their focus being on pollution prevention, safety-related matters and crew <Col N="1294" /> ability and competence. When deficiencies are noted, the vessel may be detained.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to advise that Ireland, following an evaluation by a panel of competent experts, has been found by the International Maritime Organisation to be adhering fully to the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1995 &ndash; STCW 95 &ndash; and is now on the &ldquo;white list&rdquo; or top rank of countries in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland currently has no reserves of oil so all of its oil requirements are imported. In relation to gas, 29% of the national requirement is met by production from the Kinsale Head gas field and <Col N="1295" /> the remaining 71% is imported through the interconnector. These figures reflect the decline in production of Kinsale from 1995/1996, when 83% of the national requirement was met from the Kinsale field. It is expected that the share of the national requirement supplied by indigenous gas will increase again when the Corrib field comes into production.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my previous replies of 8 February and 20 March to similar questions raised by the Deputy on positive results from exploration for oil or gas, there were developments in relation to the Corrib gas accumulation.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland declared the Corrib gas field commercial in January 2001 on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil and Marathon, and sought a lease from me for its development. This is at present being considered and evaluated by my Department. Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by at the earliest July 2003 and expect the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
    <P>Until such time as exploration drilling has taken place it is not possible to speculate regarding areas showing most or least promise. As I mentioned in my reply of 20 March last, there will be a substantial increase this year in offshore drilling activity with at least three exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited recently drilled an exploration well in the Rockall trough but this well has now been plugged and abandoned. It is expected that further exploration wells will be drilled by Statoil and EDC in the Porcupine and Fastnet basins, respectively. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited also proposes to drill a further appraisal well in the Corrib prospect in the Slyne basin and two development wells will be drilled by Marathon in the south-west Kinsale area of the north Celtic Sea basin. However, well commitments beyond 2001 only amount to between three and six for the entire Irish offshore area.</P>
    <P>Only two exploration wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore area in the last three years and there are 20 offshore exploration licences in place at present compared to a peak of 32 in 1997. Furthermore, a number of exploration companies granted licences under a licensing round in 1997 have indicated their intention to relinquish these licences this year. The stark reality is that Irish prospectivity is low and is not comparable with our oil-producing neighbours. We have only had three successful exploration wells out of 123 in 30 years. Over the same period, the United Kingdom has drilled about 3,000 wells, of which approximately 250 are in production.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I commenced an initiative aimed at both conserving certain areas of the Irish offshore by closing them off from development for the moment and gauging interest on the part of the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas. To that end, I have <Col N="1296" /> undertaken a consultation process involving companies who are Irish licence holders in order to gauge their views on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licences might be offered. This process is ongoing.</P>
    <P>As regards mineral exploration, it is gratifying that we have not only maintained, but also increased in real terms, our share of world exploration funding for non-petroleum minerals in the context of a major global cutback over the past three years. The most recent report that I laid before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts showed that at the end of December 2000 there were 480 prospecting licences being operated. The number of licences has increased over the last three years. We are actively engaged in promoting investment interest in minerals exploration from overseas companies, in order to keep the level of exploration in the country as high as possible. The success of earlier exploration work and the prospect of finding further commercial ore bodies encourages the market to concentrate on exploration for certain suites of minerals and de-emphasise others.</P>
    <P>The State itself does not carry out prospecting. In setting and agreeing the exploration programme under any licence, I ensure that the licence is awarded to the candidate proposing the most advantageous programme. By monitoring the reports of licence holders and site visits, I ensure that the terms of the commitment are met in each case, that we are immediately aware of finding any significant mineralisation and that there is a suitably aggressive pursuit of any positive results. I am pleased that recent work has identified three new zinc prospects in Counties Laois, Limerick and Wicklow, which are being followed up. Should any of these prove to be economically viable, this will be made evident to me by an application for a State mining facility. This is made in parallel with applications to the relevant local authority for planning permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and to the EPA for an integrated pollution control licence.</P>
    <P>As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the continuing attractiveness of Ireland for mineral exploration and development, my Department is currently carrying out a comparative study of international royalty and tax regimes. We are examining the preliminary results of that study. That examination and the further study results will inform policy decisions in the future and allow us to maintain our competitive status.</P>
    <P>Field work under existing licences has been hampered over recent months by the precautions to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. The restriction is being eased gradually as it is deemed prudent and on the advice of the expert group of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. For example, it has been possible from before Easter to recommence drilling or other activities which occupy a single site for a period. I would like to publicly thank and <Col N="1297" /> compliment those involved in the industry for the public-spirited way they have taken the necessary precautions.</P>

      <P>The UN International Year of Volunteers was established to recognise voluntary activity and to promote volunteer service as an important contribution to community development. Particular emphasis was placed on voluntary activity at local level. A national committee has been established under the aegis of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and is working to promote the year in Ireland. My Department is represented on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agency for Personal Services Overseas is the national body that promotes voluntary international service and will, in the course of this year, support over 1,000 people working in developing countries with Irish non-governmental organisations, international NGOs, international bodies such as the UN and with the governments and communities of the developing <Col N="1299" /> countries themselves. In addition, APSO promotes the involvement of volunteers in emergency response situations and specifically recruits and trains volunteers for this purpose. Given the local emphasis on International Year of Volunteers activities APSO is participating in local IYV activities in the developing countries in which it works.</P>
    <P>To date no applications for leave have been received from staff members in my Department in connection with this initiative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The Community Application of Information Technology initiative seeks to fund demonstration projects which encourage and assist those in our society who are unfamiliar with, and who do not use, the new information and communications technologies in their everyday lives. It is intended that the community and voluntary sector will undertake these projects. More than £2.5 million has been provided for this purpose from the information society fund over the period June 2001 to December 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> In excess of 450 proposals were received before the deadline which expired on 15 February last. These proposals have been reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated on the application form. As many as 112 were shortlisted for further evaluation. The results of this shortlisting process were posted to project proposers on 10 April 2001.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the proposal received from the Templeorum Development Association was not shortlisted for further evaluation.</P>
    <P>In the next number of weeks an independent steering group containing representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, other Departments and the private sector will consider the shortlisted proposals and make recommendations for funding.</P>
    <P>The CAIT initiative is just one of many initiatives being undertaken as part of a wider Government programme to ensure a fully inclusive information society in Ireland.</P>

      <P>On 2 October 2000 an application was received for a passenger licence to operate a bus service from Carlow to Waterford and Waterford IT from Monday to Friday.</P>
      <P>The applicant's proposed timetable conflicted with Bus Éireann's Dungarvan to Waterford service and Waterford to Carlow service. The applicant's proposed schedule also conflicted with that of another private operator on both the outward and return journey at Carlow, Ballyhale, Mullinavat and Waterford Regional Technical College.</P>
      <P>A licence was issued to the bus operator on 22 January 2001. This licence was subsequently amended on 6 February 2001 to include additional stops <i>en route</i> on the outward and return journeys. It was not possible to include stops at Ballyhale and Mullinavat as there is already another private operator licensed for this service.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1932, require that regard must be had to existing services when considering an application for a route passenger licence. In this case the existing services were considered to be sufficient.</P>

      <P>I have said on many occasions that questions about the future ownership of commercial State companies fall to be determined on a case by case basis in the context of developments in their main business areas.</P>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to the commercial State companies under my aegis. In regard to the Córas Iompair Éireann group of companies, the consultation paper entitled A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport was published by the Government in September 2000. It sets out a number of proposals in relation to the restructuring of the CIE companies including the possible privatisation of the bus companies. These proposals are currently the subject of consultation with the public transport partnership which was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Government's decision of 23 February 1999, Irish National Petroleum Corporation initiated an extensive search process to identify business development opportunities to underpin the operation of the Whitegate refinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four definite proposals were submitted to the INPC. The INPC board recommended the submission received from the Tosco Corporation to <Col N="1303" /> acquire the refinery and the Whiddy oil terminal. The proposal involves a commitment to operate the facilities in question for a minimum of 15 years. The consultants who are advising me in relation to the proposed deal subsequently endorsed that recommendation.</P>
    <P>As I announced on 31 July 2000, I authorised INPC to enter into a period of exclusive negotiations with the Tosco Corporation for the sale of the refinery, the oil terminal and the INPC business. The National Oil Reserves Agency is not included in the terms of the sales.</P>
    <P>This announcement followed an extensive search for potential partners, submission of expressions of interest and receipt of firm proposals, which were rigorously reviewed before shortlisting and final selection.</P>
    <P>INPC and Tosco have had detailed negotiations since then. I have just received a recommendation from the INPC board in favour of concluding a transaction, which I am considering. My <Col N="1304" /> Department and the Department of Finance, with the aid of legal and economic consultants, have been directly involved in the negotiations in respect of shareholder issues. Assuming that I decide to put this matter forward for Government approval, the transaction could not be completed without primary legislation which in turn will influence the timeframe. There are other issues also to be resolved, not least in relation to the employees.</P>

      <P>The following tables one to three, inclusive, display the number and grade of established positions of general service grades and technical-professional grades in my Department, the Geological Survey of Ireland and Met Éireann respectively as of 31 March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 124 posts were being filled in an acting capacity. Acting capacity is defined as staff <Col N="1306" /> promoted within 12 months of 31 March 2001 and had not yet completed their first year in that grade. There are 38 staff in this position, 17 staff were in receipt of a higher duty allowance and 67 staff had yet to complete their two year probationary period.</P>
    <P>As of 31 March 2001, there were 68 vacancies in my Department. No position has been vacant for more than one year.</P>
    <P>All recruitment to general Civil Service grades is conducted centrally by the Civil Service Commission. My Department is in the process of filling the above vacancies either through internal processes or from existing CSC panels. Indications are that the number of vacancies will be significantly reduced in the near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the filling of professional-technical positions, these are also handled by the CSC but on foot of specific requests from my Department. We are currently in the process of filling such positions.</P>
    <P>While high levels of vacancies are a concern, my officials have prioritised business objectives to minimise adverse impact on the implementation of the aspects of the national development plan for which my Department is responsible. Consequently, vacancies have not been reported to the committee of the Cabinet charged with overseeing the implementation of the NDP.</P>
    <P>The high level of vacancies currently being experienced reflects the prevailing labour market conditions in the economy as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the circumstances of the case raised by the Deputy. All aspects of this case were fully considered before a final decision was taken to discharge the person in question from the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I will outline the background to the case. The person in question enlisted in the PDF as an apprentice aircraft mechanic in the Air Corps on 24 August 1994. He developed a serious medical condition in early 1996 which deteriorated rapidly leading to a very serious degree of visual impairment, such that he was not in a position to, and has since remained unable, to complete his course of training as an Air Corps apprentice. Unfortunately, the prognosis for the future does not envisage any change in his situation. Clerical work experience and allied educational and training opportunities were provided for him in order to facilitate the transition to civilian life and alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> In September 1998 a medical board found that the diagnosed medical condition indicated that his medical classification was below the Defence Forces's medical standards. This finding of the board derived from the fact that his medical condition left him unfit for military duties by way of the marked degree of visual impairment occasioned by his medical condition. The individual was informed of his right to make representations to the director of the Medical Corps against the determination of the medical board but did not, in the event, elect to do so.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Defence Force regulations, the procedures for his discharge from the Defence Forces were then initiated. He was informed by his commanding officer on 19 November 1998 that it was proposed to discharge him and that he had seven days within which to make representations, either verbally or in writing, against the proposed discharge.</P>
    <P>The person in question subsequently made an application to the deputy chief of staff, support, under Defence Force regulations for continued retention in service. On 1 February 1999, the deputy chief of staff, support, having considered the case, decided that he should be discharged from the Defence Forces in accordance with Defence Force regulations.</P>
    <P>The person concerned then submitted a redress of wrongs application in relation to his proposed discharge under the provisions of section 114 of the Defence Act. This redress application duly reached me through the usual sequence of appeal provided for within the redress machinery.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter in great detail and for a considerable period, I could find no grounds for deciding that a wrong had occurred in this case and, therefore, the proposed discharge should proceed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the severity of the medical condition, which has resulted in the proposed discharge, is such that there is no practical or reasonable alternative course of action available.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a 2000 area aid application on which he declared a total of 29.76 hectares forage and 2.46 hectares cereals. In 1999 he applied for 29.76 ha forage and 2.46 ha cereals. In 1998 he applied for 29.63 ha forage and 2.32 ha cereals and in 1997 he applied for 29.63 ha forage and 2.43 ha cereals.</P>

      <P>In so far as including extra land in his application is concerned, guidelines for this are set out in the help sheet for 2001 area aid applications.

      <P>The rates of pension payable under the two schemes of early retire<Col N="1314" /> ment are not index linked. The rate payable under the 1994 scheme is the maximum permitted under the governing regulation, EU Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2079/92. The rate in the new scheme is set down in the Rural Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department had initially proposed annual increases in the rate of pension for the new scheme but the European Commission stated that only a fixed rate was acceptable. My Department then proposed a rate that was the average of the scale initially proposed and the Commission accepted this.</P>
      <P>Compensation for reductions arising from the revaluation of the Irish pound on the introduction of the euro in January 1999 was set at 75% for the year 2000. This was paid to scheme participants at the end of March 2001. It was in accordance with arrangements to apply to CAP payments following the introduction of the euro which were determined by the Council of Ministers in December 1998. The council's decision was taken in accordance with the principle that in cases of currency revaluation provision should be made for temporary, degressive aid to offset the effects.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement of EU Council Regulation 2079/92, under which the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming was introduced, that any national retirement pension to which a scheme participant becomes entitled must be offset against the early retirement pension payable. The same requirement forms part of the new scheme which was introduced in November 2000.</P>
      <P>As the scheme is approved and co-financed by the European Union, my Department has no discretion in the matter and must continue to apply this requirement to comply with its obligations with regard to EU funds.</P>

      <Quest>if, in cases where BSE has been identified in a farm animal and agreement has been reached with the farmer in question to depopulate his herd, he will give the reason it has taken up to 12 weeks to depopulate the herd; the further reason it has taken a further number of months for compensation to be paid to the farmers for the loss of their herds; the procedure to compensate the farmer for the additional foodstuffs and so on given to this herd while awaiting slaughter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In respect of BSE, my Department's policy is to depopulate herds as quickly as possible once agreement is reached on a herd valuation, and to pay the individual concerned as soon as possible after the herd has been slaughtered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have, in recent months, been delays in a small number of cases between the confirmation of the BSE case and the valuation of the herd; and the date of the agreement on valuation and depopulation. The delays in valuation arose because an increase in the numbers of BSE herds <Col N="1318" /> at the end of last year put pressure on the limited number of departmental valuers available. Additional valuers were engaged as quickly as possible and this backlog has been now dealt with.</P>
    <P>The delays in depopulation following agreement of a valuation resulted from a backlog in rendering of depopulated herds because of an increase in the volume of specified risk materials &ndash; SRMs &ndash; following a Commission decision which added bovine intestines to the list of SRMs. This virtually doubled the volume of SRMs to be rendered at a time when only one rendering plant, with limited capacity, was approved by the Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; for the rendering of these materials. However, the Environmental Protection Agency has, since then, approved two additional rendering plants for this purpose and I do not anticipate any further untoward delays in completing depopulation.</P>
    <P>As for the payment of depopulation grants, these are, in all instances, paid promptly once the herd is depopulated and all of the necessary documentation is received. The Department's policy is to pay market value for animals depopulated as a result of BSE. However, in relation to the particular group of farmers affected by the delays in valuation process, a once off <i>ex gratia</i> payment, based on a flat rate payment per animal in the <Col N="1319" /> herd was made, in recognition of the unique delays encountered.</P>

      <P>The required information is set out in the following schedule. Posts shown in acting capacity column are those posts filled on a temporary acting up allowance. These are primarily temporary vacancies which have <Col N="1320" /> arisen for a variety of reasons, for example, maternity, sick, parental, special leave and other short time needs. By their nature it is not appropriate to fill them on a permanent basis. It is common practice in this Department to fill some senior level positions initially by means of a higher duty allowance. As the permanent post has been filled it is not regarded as a vacancy and these posts are not therefore included in the acting capacity column.</P>
      <P>Vacancies in recruitment level posts are filled through the Civil Service Commission or through the central transfer list. In relation to those posts filled by the commission, it has requests on hands for all vacant positions in the Department. The timeframe for filling these posts varies as it depends on the take-up of the post in question and whether or not a panel is already in existence. The use and existence of panels is a matter for the commission.</P>
      <P>Vacancies in promotion posts are normally filled from internal promotion panels. Current panels exist for all vacancies listed with the exception of HEO. Interviews are currently being conducted with a view to establishing an internal HEO panel. The timeframe for filling vacancies where panels exist is approximately a month but provincial vacancies can sometimes take a bit longer.</P>
      <P>My Department has not been made aware of an instance where the delay in filling vacancies has affected the implementation of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>Under sections 15 and 16 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, public bodies are required to publish their reference manuals upon commencement of the Act in the particular body in question. Revised versions of the manuals are required to be prepared and published by each body not less frequently than three years after publication of the previous versions. I am satisfied that the provisions of the Act in relation to the timescale for the publication and updating of the reference material is reasonable. Of course, public bodies may, and some do, publish revised versions of their documentation more frequently than required under the Act. It is a matter for each public body to consider its needs and those of its customers in this regard.</P>

      <P>A State resident is not allowed to use an unregistered or foreign registered vehicle in the State and all such vehicles must be registered in the State by the end of the next working day following importation. The Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent Reliefs) Regulations, 1993, S.I. No. 59 of 1993, <Col N="1323" /> provide for the registration of motor vehicles in the State, in certain particular circumstances, without the payment of vehicle registration tax, VRT. In order to qualify for relief from VRT under the above regulations, it is a requirement that, <i>inter alia</i>, the person concerned must have been normally resident outside the State prior to the importation of the vehicle and it is in this context that the 185 days referred to in the question is relevant. &ldquo;Normal residence&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of the regulations as the place where a person lives for at least 185 days in each year because of personal or occupational ties.</P>
      <P>The rules governing the relief from VRT as set out in S.I. No. 59 of 1993 are based on the rules governing the movement of motor vehicles and goods into and within the European Union, and any change would require an equivalent change in the relevant EU legislation. I have no proposals to change the provisions of Statutory Instrument No. 59 of 1993 at this time.</P>

      <P>The imposition of VAT is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. It would not be possible therefore to relieve new inventions of VAT.</P>
      <P>New products, when they are sold to consumers may have to be rated for VAT purposes but will be either zero rated, reduced rated, 12.5% or standard rated, 20%. Where a taxable person produces a new invention which is subject to VAT, they can recover the VAT on inputs used in making that invention.</P>

      <P>The Government will make a formal response to the Commission on Public Service Pensions' recommendations once it has considered that report in detail. The Government will then move to establish the working group, provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to advise on implementation of the relevant Government decisions. The working group will comprise representatives of the public service unions, relevant Departments, and other appropriate bodies.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations have implications for all parties having an interest in public service pensions &ndash; the Government, public service employers, trade unions, pensioner associations, such as the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland, individual public servants, and pensioners, as well as the taxpayer. For this reason, the Government is taking particular care in examining the report.</P>
      <P>When publishing the report, I commented on the commission view that its recommendations represented an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the measures in the report as a whole. As I stated then, I expect this to be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to address specific issues in isolation at this stage.</P>

      <P>The current money laundering guidance notes require financial institutions to verify address as part of the process to take reasonable measures to establish identification as required by section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. Some of the means of verifying address which are set out in the guidance notes include: checking electoral register, credit reference agency search, recent utility bill, bank or building society statement, checking a local telephone directory or by way of an introduction from a respected customer. In exceptional cases, where independent address verification is not possible, a manager may authorise the opening of an account where satisfied with the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised draft guidance notes, which will be <Col N="1325" /> finalised and issued shortly, contain additional examples of items which can be used for address verification. These include home-motor insurance documents, social welfare documents, documents issued by Revenue, for example, tax free allowance certificate, and letter-statement from a person in responsibility who is in a position to confirm the person's address. The proposed new Garda form, which is not yet in place, is intended to serve as one possible alternative method of personal identification for persons who do not hold a passport or driving licence. It is not intended to be a means of address verification.</P>
    <P>By way of background, I should explain that the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, implements the EU money laundering directive in Ireland. Section 32 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a financial institution &ldquo;shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person for whom it proposes to provide a service&rdquo;. It is the legal responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that it complies with this provision.</P>
    <P>The Act does not state what may or may not represent reasonable measures and does not provide for the making of regulations in this regard. Accordingly, in order to facilitate consistent implementation of the anti-money laundering provisions of the Act, guidance notes were issued in April 1995 by the money laundering steering committee, established under the aegis of my Department and representing various sectors of the financial services industry and the relevant regulatory authorities. These guidance notes recommend that a customer's identity be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature. The guidance notes also indicate how a person's address might be verified, as outlined above.</P>
    <P>The 1995 guidance notes have been under review for some time. The issue of customer identification procedures, including the issue of setting out more specific guidance on alternative methods of identification and address verification is a primary part of this review. The objective is to ensure that measures adopted by institutions should not deny a person access to financial services on the grounds that they do not possess specified identification documentation, while at the same time ensuring that financial institutions are in a position to comply with their legal obligations under the Act. This review process is being finalised and it is expected that revised guidance notes will be issued in due course.</P>

      <P>There is only one EU directive awaiting implementation by my Department. The details are as follows. Directive 2000/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on the taking up, pursuit of and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions, e-money directive &ndash; the main purpose of this directive is to provide the appropriate measures necessary to enable the co-ordination and harmonisation of member states' laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of electronic money, e-money, institutions. Electronic money is defined in the proposals as monetary value stored on a microchip card, pre-paid card or electronic purse, or on a computer memory, network or software money, and which is accepted as a means of payment by undertakings other than those of the issuer.</P>
      <P>The directive, approved by the Council on 16 June 2000, states that the member states shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive no later than 27 April 2002. I am pleased to report that we are on schedule to meet this deadline.</P>

      <P>The new Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was approved by the European Commission on 22 March 2001. The next phase of the programme's development involves the production of the programme complement. The programme complement sets out a range of implementation issues, including the method for delivery of funds, detailed measure descriptions, and project selection criteria. This phase of development is at an advanced stage and must be completed by the middle of June next. My expectation is that funding under the programme will be released shortly thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to INTERREG, I am assuming the Deputy is primarily interested in the programme with Northern Ireland for the period to the end of 2006. Proposals for this INTERREG IIIA programme were lodged with the European Commission last November following approval by the North-South Ministerial Council. Authorities North and South are awaiting the formal response of the Commission to these proposals before detailed negotiations can open. I and my counterpart in the North-South Ministerial Council, Mr. Mark Durkan MLA, Minister of Finance and Personnel in the Northern Ireland Executive, are anxious that these negotiations be completed quickly. In a similar manner to the peace pro<Col N="1327" /> gramme, detailed implementation procedures will be contained in a programme complement and this phase of development can only be completed once the programme is agreed. I am, accordingly, hopeful that funding under the INTERREG programme will be available later this year.</P>
    <P>Including matching national funds, 141.3 million euro has been allocated to the Border region under the Peace and Reconcilation Programme 2000-2004. The South's contribution to the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA Programme 2000-2006 is 71.5 million euro, including matching national funds. Both programmes are being managed by the special EU programmes body and will be implemented by a range of Government Departments, intermediary funding bodies and locally based agencies.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of hospital services to residents of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA. I have, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the matters raised and to respond to the Deputy directly.</P>
      <P>Addressing the problem of long waiting lists has been a priority matter for the Government and my Department in recent years. Significant increased investment in tackling this problem has contained and improved the situation at national level. However, I am concerned by the lengthy delays which are still being experienced by people awaiting orthopaedic treatment, including those who are awaiting a hip replacement in the eastern region. The issues involved in waiting lists are many and complex and bed shortage is an aspect of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard the Deputy will be aware that I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This review involves the development of a long-term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and will <Col N="1329" /> include a detailed assessment of future bed requirements in response to increasing demand and changing demographics. The review will be completed shortly and will inform future policy discussions with regard to the development of acute hospital services and future strategies relating to such issues as waiting lists. The national review will also be informed by a recent ERHA needs assessment which identified a requirement for over 1,200 additional acute beds by 2011 to meet increasing service pressures in the region.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 the Government is committed to investing £1 billion for the development of acute hospital services. I am satisfied that this investment will improve the capacity of the acute hospital sector to respond to increased demand for services over this period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies have been brought to my attention by various professional interest groups in the area of neurology, neurosurgery and neurophysiology. Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new effective complex therapies for many disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease becoming available. The challenge is to develop an integrated and co-ordinated health and social welfare system that is geared towards the particular needs of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments <Col N="1330" /> of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to such services. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups I have requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues with the following terms of reference: </P>
    <P>&ldquo;To examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 Comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The need for additional investment in the neurological and neurosurgical service will be considered in the light of the review by An Comhairle, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding. I look forward to receiving An Comhairle's report in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to the trend in the number of persons waiting for treatment in the areas of neurology and neurosurgery the waiting list figures for 1997 to 2000 indicate the following:</P>

      <P>Persons who were infected with hepatitis C through the administration within the State of <Col N="1331" /> blood or blood products are awarded a health services card rather than a medical card. The health services card carries more benefits for the individual with hepatitis C than the medical card, and is not means tested or subject to periodic review.</P>
      <P>Health services cards are awarded by the health boards under the terms of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996. Under the Act, the health boards make available, without charge, the following services to persons infected by hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood or blood products: GP services in relation to all medical conditions; prescribed drugs and medicines; home support services; home nursing services; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; counselling services in respect of hepatitis C; other services, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Liaison officers have been appointed in each health board to co-ordinate the services provided under the Act, and to provide a contact point for hepatitis C patients and the four support groups &ndash; Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, Irish Haemophilia Society and Irish Kidney Association.</P>
      <P>In addition to the services available under the health services card, hospital services for this group of patients are provided through the following designated units: Beaumont, Mater, St. James's and St. Vincent's Hospitals, Dublin; Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin; St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway. Under the health care package made available to persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood or blood products, it is guaranteed that no patient will have to wait more than two weeks for an appointment to a hepatitis C unit. Patients referred by a liver consultant to another specialty, for example, gynaecology or rheumatology, are guaranteed their first appointment within two weeks. Subsequent appointments are on the basis of clinical need.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I and my Department are fully committed to the continued development of primary care and hospital services for persons with hepatitis C, and the provision of adequate resources for these services.</P>

      <P>The provision of a community nursing unit in Ballinasloe has been identified by the Western Health Board as a priority within the funding which will be made available to the board under the national development plan in relation to services for older people in the period up to, and including, 2006. It is hoped that, at minimum, a phase of the Ballinasloe project will have been provided by the end of 2006 but, as yet, there have been no firm decisions made on content or possible start dates.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in County Limerick is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board. Under the National Development Plan 2001-2006 a total of £16.349 million was allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board for capital investment in the development of services for older people. It is a matter for the board to decide its priority development projects within the national development plan. As the Deputy will be aware, the board has included the provision of an elderly mentally infirm unit at St. Ita's Hospital in its proposals for inclusion in the national development plan. Interviews have recently been held to select an architect for the development and a recommendation from the board is under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Limerick area is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> Following the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board in June 2000, the responsibility for the provision of audiology services throughout the regions was assigned initially to the Northern Area Health Board of the ERHA pending each health board taking over direct responsibility for the services within its own region.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me that the authority has been actively seeking to recruit suitably qualified staff to fill vacancies in the service with little success. The national audiology advisory group is examining ways to increase the availability of qualified audiology staff and the ERHA is now encouraging all health boards to sponsor suitable students for training courses in both audiology and audiological science. Currently four students are attending the audiology training course in Belfast being sponsored by health boards and one health board audiologist will commence a course in audiological science in Manchester later this year. The ERHA is also undertaking a review of audiology services in the eastern region and a committee has been established to oversee this review.</P>

      <P>The report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the report of the medical manpower forum were brought to Government on 3 April 2001 for consideration and approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly welcome the decisions by the Government in relation to the two reports. The recommendations contained in both these reports were achieved by consensus and on a partnership basis. The reports represent a significant step forward for the health services in that they map out a set of proposals for the reduction of NCHD hours to the level required by the EU directive. The Government has welcomed the progress made towards the implementation of the 48 hour week for NCHDs and the revised structures for medical training. The report on NCHD working hours was undertaken in response to the EU directive to reduce the working week to 48 hours by 2010. The timetable for the implementation of the directive, in so far as it affects NCHDs, is as follows. In 2004 the average working hours per week will be reduced to 58. By 2007 there will be a further reduction of two hours per week to 56. By 2009 the average hours worked by NCHDs <Col N="1336" /> will be 48. The immediate task is to get to 58 hours by 2004 and interim measures to start this process will be taken this year. The report also contains recommendations on major changes in the way doctors are trained, flexible working arrangements and family-friendly policies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>The latest figures for numbers employed in the professions requested are given in the following table. The data are from the health service personnel census of 31 December 1999 and are expressed in wholetime equivalents &ndash; wte. Figures in respect of 31 December 2000 are being compiled at present and will be available in the near future. The census does not contain data on psychologists by specialist areas and therefore I am unable to give separate figures for child psychologists.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have figures for the number of current vacancies, nor the projected number of posts needed over the next seven years. I have asked the chief executive officers of each of the health boards to forward the information on vacancies and projected need for the next seven years directly to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the general question of workforce planning in the health and social care professions area, my Department commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to conduct a study on the current and future supply and demand conditions for certain professional therapists which will be published in the near future. Among the issues to be addressed by this study is the number of additional training places required by the physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. Through the Higher Education Authority, the possibility of increasing the number of training colleges, as well as training places will also be addressed. A service review of psychology services in the health boards is under way. Discussions on additional postgraduate places have taken place with heads of the schools <Col N="1337" /> of psychology. Some 30 additional places came on stream from October 2000 and further places are expected in October 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,315. When account is taken of the service of agency nurses &ndash; 423 per day &ndash; and overtime working &ndash; equivalent to 592 nurses per day &ndash; the net number of vacancies at 31 January 2001 stands at 300. The gross number of vacancies reported for the Eastern Regional Health Auth<Col N="1341" /> ority region, excluding the learning disability sector, was 1,148.79.</P>
    <P>The survey reported that a total of 4,226 nurses were recruited in the year ending 31 January 2001, and that a total of 2,954 resigned or retired in the same period. Accordingly, the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving, with a net increase of 1,272 nurses in the system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the projected need for additional nursing places for the next seven years, the commission on nursing identified a need to strengthen the workforce planning functions in my Department. My Department acted on the recommendation by setting up a study of the nursing and midwifery resource in December 1998. The aim of the project is to analyse the present position with regard to the nursing and midwifery workforce, to devise a system for the projection of future needs and to plan how these needs may be met.</P>
    <P>This project arises from the need for an enhanced focus on workforce planning having regard, in particular, to the availability of sufficient nurses now and in the future. The nurse staffing difficulties now confronting the Irish health service mirror the situation in other countries where shortages of nurses have been a problem for several years. The experience of countries that have been dealing with this problem indicates that there is no simple solution and that a multifaceted approach is required in addressing this complex issue.</P>
    <P>A steering group chaired by my Department's chief nursing officer was convened in December 1998 to oversee the nursing and midwifery resource project. The group focused on developing a base line on nursing and midwifery employment. Part of creating the base line involved conducting a survey to obtain a national overview of the provision of post-registration courses in specialised areas of clinical practice and the number of places available.</P>
    <P>The steering group commissioned a national study of turnover in nursing and midwifery which is being undertaken by a research team in the department of nursing studies, University College, Cork. In February 2000 and March 2001 a survey was also undertaken to gain an insight into the provision of return to nursing and midwifery programmes. A survey of nursing and midwifery employment in the independent sector &ndash; nursing homes, private hospitals, intellectual disability services, physical disabilities, palliative care services and nursing agencies &ndash; was conducted in May 2000 to provide an understanding of the size and requirement of employment in the independent sector.</P>
    <P>An interim report of the study was published in September 2000. The nursing and midwifery resource interim report of the steering group identified as an urgent priority the refinement of systems and processes used to supply essential information to ensure that forecasts for future nursing and midwifery requirement are feasible <Col N="1342" /> and improve over time. Highlighted in the interim report are the inadequacies of existing databases to yield reliable information on which to base forecasts. To address this, work is progressing on the development of a new personnel, payroll, attendance recruitment system &ndash; PPARS &ndash; that will capture essential data on each individual and post within the health service. The PPARS project is a fundamental building block in developing dependable, reliable and robust quality information to forecast human resource requirements for the health service in the future.</P>
    <P>In 2000 there was a 25% increase in the number of nurse training places from 1,200 to 1,500. The interim report recommended that the annual intake of nursing students should continue at this level until at least 2003. My Department has accepted this recommendation. In addition, with a view to increasing the number of general nursing training places in Dublin, funding has been provided to St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, to commence the pre-registration nursing diploma programme in autumn 2001 with an annual intake of 40 students.</P>

      <P>My decision to make nicotine replacement therapies available to medical card holders was taken on foot of recommendations made by the cardiovascular health strategy group and the advisory forum established to support the task force in the implementation of strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that would not normally satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over the counter, and may be advertised directly to the public. However, in light of the recommendations that have been made to me I have decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders only. Evidence shows that the lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco. Accordingly, it is considered that this group is in greatest need of assistance in helping them to quit the habit. I have no plans <Col N="1343" /> to make nicotine replacement therapies available under the other community drug schemes. I should add however that Zyban, which is only available on prescription, is included in the common list and is therefore reimbursable on both the general medical services and community drugs schemes.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated number of extra hospital beds needed in the Eastern Regional Health Authority region and in the country as a whole; the time frame for the delivery of these extra beds; the average capital costs and the average running costs involved in the provision of these beds.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. It involves the development of a long-term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and will include a detailed assessment of future bed requirements in response to increasing demand and changing demographics. The review is now at an advanced stage and its findings will be brought to Government shortly. The capital and revenue costs associated with the provision of additional beds are being examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>In parallel with this review, the Eastern Regional Health Authority recently completed a comprehensive acute bed needs assessment for its region. The study identified a requirement for 1,276 additional acute beds by 2011 to meet increasing demands. The objective of the ERHA review was to determine whether additional acute beds are required within the eastern region based on good standards of efficiency, population characteristics and medical/health care developments.</P>
      <P>The ERHA review also identified a need to increase the number of non-acute beds for the care of older people in the region. This is seen as essential in order to allow for increased capacity and throughput in acute hospitals. The work of the ERHA will inform the preparation of a national assessment of bed requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 the Government is committed to investing £1 billion for the development of acute hospital services. I am satisfied that this investment will improve the <Col N="1344" /> capacity of the acute hospital sector to respond to increased demand for services over this period.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the lack of consistency in the payment of nursing home subvention between the Southern Health Board area and the Mid-Western Health Board; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Southern Health Board area pays the maximum amount to meet the nursing home charge as opposed to the maximum recommended subvention of £150 in the case of the Mid-Western Health Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120, £150 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>

      <P>The strategic review of the fire service, which will get under way shortly, will address the issue of difficulty of recruiting and retaining staff for the fire service, principally the retained service. Proposals for the carrying out of this review have been sought and tenders are being evaluated in my Department at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 55 year age limit for retirement of fire fighters was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job. Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk. International research indicates that the retirement age of 55 is the optimum age to ensure that fire fighters are capable of satisfactorily performing the tasks expected of them. The compulsory age of retirement has been set in the light of the strenuous nature of fire fighters duties, the possibilities of persons of a particular age achieving the physical capabilities required and the risks involved in undertaking such work. The final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was published recently, recom<Col N="1351" /> mended that new entrant fire fighters should continue to be subject to a retirement age of 55.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing it would be inappropriate to change the current arrangements pending the completion of the strategic review.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a scheme whereby certain categories of dog owners could obtain a dog licence at a reduced rate has been examined. While it is recognised that a dog can provide both a sense of security and companionship to many elderly people and to people living alone, it would not, unfortunately, be feasible to introduce such a scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs and a loss of revenue to the local authorities who rely on the revenue from the sale of dog licences to finance their dog control activities. At a practical level also, such a scheme would give rise to difficulties for local authorities in attempting to establish the true ownership of a dog which was covered by a reduced fee licence but which was being kept by a person who was not eligible for such a licence.</P>

The average waiting time for the centre is 23 weeks. On average two testers have been assigned to work in the centre each week since the beginning of the year. A weekly average of 35 tests have been conducted by eight separate testers who have worked in the centre on different occasions. Tests are normally scheduled for five days a week and tests have been conducted on Saturday on twelve separate occasions in the period up to 28 April 2001. The pass rate at the centre is 55.5%; the national pass rate is 56.4%. In the period from 1 January to 28 April 2001, 96 candidates failed to show up for their scheduled test appointment.</P>

      <P>Current town authority structures derive from the 19th century. <Col N="1354" /> Overall the system was considered unduly fragmented by the commission on town local government which advised that further fragmentation of responsibility for mainline service provision should be avoided. The question of fragmented service responsibility was also referred to adversely in the recent OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. Against this background there are no proposals for the creation of additional UDC type authorities each with separate responsibility for mainline services such as housing, roads, rating, water, planning nor indeed has any such authority been established since the foundation of the State. Rather the Local Government Bill, 2000, currently before the Dáil, seeks to promote closer co-operation and more integrated customer service between town and county; to allow what are currently town commissioners to develop a more community focus within a modern legislative framework; town local authorities to be known as town councils and with provision for an office of mayor; local bye laws and option to raise funding for local facilities and for structured linkage with the county council. Various other initiatives such as the one stop shop programme, the urban and village renewal programme and improved input under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, are also designed to support the development of such towns.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 210 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority was established with effect from 1 January 1994 and has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. Information on national roads since the establishment of the NRA should appropriately be sought from the authority itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on national road improvement projects from 1989 to the establishment of the NRA, which cost in excess of £1 million, is set out in the Department's roads bulletin 1993. I am arranging to have a copy of the relevant extract <Col N="1355" /> sent to the Deputy. Information prior to 1989 is not readily available.</P>
    <P>Information on recent relevant non-national road projects funded under the Department's specific grants programme is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There are currently two bridges in the State, which were built under public private partnership arrangements, namely, the East Link and West Link bridges in Dublin. The nature of the private sector involvement in each case is set out in the relevant agreements between the parties.</P>

      <P>My Department obtains regular returns from mortgage lending institutions in respect of the prices of houses for which mortgage loans are approved and house loan survey data provided voluntarily by individual house purchasers and collected by the mortgage lending agencies. The quarterly Housing Statistics Bulletin, published by my Department, contains <i>inter alia</i>, information on house prices nationally and for Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. However, this information is not segregated into individual local authority areas or in the case of Dublin into postal districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy in relation to first time <Col N="1359" /> house buyers is targeted at this category of home purchaser as a whole and the effectiveness of measures in relation to this grouping is assessed on this basis, taking account of price trends nationally and in the major urban areas.</P>
    <P>I have appointed consultants to examine the current methodology for monitoring house prices, to recommend improvements and to establish a methodology for collating, analysing and producing more comprehensive house price information in the future. The consultants' report is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>Stage 1 of the south Westmeath regional water supply scheme, estimated to cost £9 million, which will in the first instance address the supply problems in Athlone and its immediate environs, is included in the 2000 to 2002 Water Services Investment Programme as a scheme to be progressed through planning.</P>
      <P>Further stages of the scheme to service Moate, and in due course Tang, Glasson, Drumraney and other areas of south Westmeath can only be progressed after Stage 1 has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, Westmeath County Council has sought to implement interim solutions for Moate, the first of which involved the augmentation of the supply from a groundwater source at Knockdomney. This was commissioned late last year under the small schemes programme. A report on further possible interim sources was received by my Department from the council last month. The <Col N="1360" /> report is being examined and a response will issue to the Council as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The source monitoring programme being undertaken by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee commenced in September 2000 and is intended to run for a 12 month period. Sampling was suspended as a result of the foot and mouth disease outbreak but is expected to resume shortly. The committee will make the results available, through the local authorities, to all relevant group schemes as soon as the sampling programme is completed and the results collated. Interim results for the period up to February 2001 have been notified to local authorities.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases or in relation to appeals lodged with health boards concerning decisions made on claims. Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels, which are reviewed regularly, in respect of various classes of persons, for example, single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc., as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.  If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The case raised by the Deputy concerns a single person living in the South-Eastern Health Board region. That board has advised that the maximum reasonable rent limit for a single person in its area is £70 per week whereas she is currently paying rent of £103.85 per week. She is the sole occupant of a three bedroom house. The community welfare officer advised her that she was over accommodated and suggested that she should either seek more suitable accommodation or advertise for two other tenants to share the house. In the meantime, the person concerned is currently in receipt of a rent supplement of £36.20 per week. This takes into account the household size and the amount of income that the person has.</P>
      <P>As stated by the Deputy, an appeal on medical grounds was lodged with the health board in November 2000 regarding payment of rent supplement at the address in question. The health board has further advised that the reason for the delay in processing the appeal is that an up to date medical report that was requested from the person concerned is still outstanding. As soon as the medical report is made available to the health board the appeal will be processed immediately.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider introducing a scheme whereby persons who leave the public service in order to take up positions in the private sector, would be granted 12 months credits at Class A in the preceding contribution year, in order that a maternity claim or a sickness claim could be made at any time in the new employment; the estimated cost of making this concession; and if it proves costly, if he will consider offering this concession as an option offered to people based on a partial contribution towards the cost.</Quest>

      <P>Permanent and pensionable public servants employed before April 1995 are liable for PRSI Class D contributions. This is a modified rate of PRSI, that is, the combined employer and employee contribution rate is 5.25% as opposed to the standard Class A contribution of either 12.5% or 18%, depending on the level of weekly income. In return, Class D contributors are insured for a limited range of social insurance benefits &ndash; widow/er's and orphan's (contributory) pensions, bereavement grant and occupational injury benefits only, and the level of benefits available broadly reflects the level of contribution paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On leaving the public service to take up other employment in the private sector or self-employment, a former Class D contributor's PRSI status would change. For instance, they would become liable for the standard Class A PRSI contribution if they took up employment in the private sector <Col N="1365" /> or PRSI Class S contribution if they took up self-employment. Eligibility for benefits, such as maternity benefit and disability benefit, in this case would be determined in the same way as anyone else becoming insured for the first time at either Class A or S.</P>
    <P>To qualify for short-term social insurance payments, a claimant must have paid a minimum number of contributions, 39 weeks, and demonstrate a recent attachment to the work force by having a minimum number of contributions in a recent tax year. More flexible conditions apply in the case of the maternity benefit scheme. For instance, a woman may also qualify if she has paid at least 39 contributions in the 12 months immediately before she commences her maternity leave. Data is not available on the number of former public servants who have left the public service to take up employment in the private sector and who subsequently fail to fulfil the contribution conditions for maternity or disability benefits. It is therefore not possible to cost the award of full credits to such persons for the relevant tax year. In any event, it should be noted that a potential claimant for the benefits in question would have to satisfy the basic contribution conditions which require a total of 39 contributions paid since entry into insurance and that the award of credits, <i>per se</i>, would not fulfil this condition. Furthermore, I consider that the introduction of a partial contribution towards the cost of such credits would have the effect of unnecessarily introducing more complexity into the social insurance system and would be contrary to the fundamental principles of social insurance. I am satisfied that the current contribution conditions applying to the maternity benefit scheme are reasonable and strike a fair balance between the interests of the average contributor and those of the average beneficiary. Accordingly, I do not propose to introduce any changes to the current arrangements.</P>

      <P>The person to whom, it is understood, the question refers is a qualified adult on her husband's retirement pension. He is currently in receipt of this pension at the rate of £185.60 per week inclusive of a qualified adult allowance of £79.60. On the basis of her own contribution record, the person concerned would qualify for a special pre-1953 old age contributory pension or a reduced standard rate old age contributory pension based upon her contributions since 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If she opted to receive either pension, the amount payable would be £53 per week, that is, <Col N="1366" /> half the maximum personal standard rate pension. In that event if she opted to receive either of these pensions, the qualified adult allowance on her husband's retirement pension would cease. Accordingly, she and her husband are better off financially if she remains as a qualified adult on his pension. She has been notified of this position.</P>

      <P>An application for a carer's allowance from the person concerned was received by my Department on 13 November 2000.</P>
      <P>Regarding her application, additional medical evidence was required in respect of both care recipients and considered by my Department's chief medical adviser. Having examined all the evidence provided, he expressed the opinion that neither care recipient was so disabled as to require full-time care and attention. Having regard to this assessment the application was refused. The person concerned appealed the decision in respect of one of the care recipients and submitted additional medical evidence. No appeal was lodged in respect of the other care recipient. This additional medical evidence was referred to my Department's medical adviser for consideration on 2 May 2001. On receipt of the medical adviser's report, her application will be further considered and she will be notified of the outcome. If the original decision remains unchanged, her case will be referred immediately to an appeals officer for determination. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, published in August 1999, considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of qualifying for social insurance payments, such as disability benefit and invalidity pension, a person must fulfil all the relevant conditions including the social insurance contribution conditions relating to the particular benefit being claimed. Short-term benefits such as the payment of disability benefit for up to a year require the claimant to have paid a minimum number of contributions, 39 weeks, and to demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce by having a minimum number of contributions in a recent tax year. For long-term benefits, such as the invalidity pension and the payment of disability benefit beyond a year, the person must have paid a more substantial minimum number of contributions, 260 weeks, in addition to having a recent attachment to the work force. I am satisfied that the current contribution conditions applying to the disability benefit and invalidity pension schemes are reasonable and strike a fair balance between the interests of the average contributor and those of the average beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, is to develop proposals to progress the individualisation of social welfare payments in the context of the continuation of joint assessment of means. The programme also requires that proposals be developed for the implementation of administrative individualisation which could, for instance, involve paying the qualified adult allowance directly to the spouse or partner of a social welfare recipient. A working group comprising rep<Col N="1368" /> resentatives of my Department, the Department of Finance and the social partners is currently examining the issues associated with this proposal.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the social welfare system cohabiting couples are treated the same as married couples and where a social assistance payment, such as disability allowance, is being claimed a household means test is applied. While the possibility of making separate payments is being explored there are no plans to change the basis on which the household income is assessed. Means testing people on an individual basis without regard to the income of their spouse or partner would be extremely costly and, perhaps more importantly, would not ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a widow with one child dependent and the income limit that would normally apply in such circumstances is £124 per week.</P>
      <P>However, there are special conditions in place which allow people participating in an approved employment scheme such as community employment, CE, to retain their entitlement to secondary benefits including the BSCF allowance as long as their household income is less than £250 per week.                         </P>

The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>There is no automatic entitlement to the BSCF allowance. A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare, including family income support, FIS, or health board payment or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain prescribed levels. These income levels vary depending on the composition of the household and they are increased each year in line with budgetary increases in weekly social welfare payments. Details of the income limits for 2001 are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>There are special conditions in place which allow people participating in an approved employment scheme to retain their entitlement to the BSCF allowance as long as their household income is less than £250 per week. Under the scheme an allowance of £63 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. An estimated 2,500 families in receipt of FIS qualified for the BSCF allowance in 2000.</P>

    <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme also allows health boards to make a single payment to help meet <Col N="1370" /> essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments, ENP, and are normally made to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Health boards recognise that confirmation and communion times involve families in additional expense and all boards assist with such costs under this provision.</P>
    <P>However, there is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. Health boards decide each application on its merits having regard to the income and circumstances of the applicant. Payment of ENPs are made at the discretion of the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding individual cases.</P>

      <Quest>if he has apologised to the 80 year old man who was recently awarded £73,875 by his Department as a result of intervention by the Ombudsman; if he has offered any compensation for the effort this man expended and the frustration he endured over the years to secure this result; if he will commence an investigation into the way in which this injustice occurred and to establish beyond all doubt whether there are other people who have had to suffer as a result of similar incorrect decisions by his Department; if he will publish the results of this investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question claimed old age contributory pension in November 1986. At that time the Department's central records section showed that he had an average of 16 contributions a year since he first became insurably employed whereas a yearly average of at least 20 contributions was required to qualify for pension. His claim was accordingly refused. He did not appeal that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record on which this decision was based showed that he did not have any paid or credited contribution after 1973. However, arising from an inquiry by the Ombudsman in 1999 it came to <Col N="1371" /> light that additional credited contributions had in fact been awarded to him subsequent to 1986 for the period 1973-1986 where he had been in receipt of unemployment assistance. It is not clear why these credits had not been awarded earlier as the relevant claim papers are no longer available. It appears that in 1990 the local office at which he had been claiming notified the central records section that they were due. Due to an oversight, the person's pension entitlement was not reviewed in the light of this new information at the time. This review was undertaken in 1999 and arising from this he qualified for retirement pension from 1986 at age 65 and for old age contributory pension from 1987 at age 66. He was paid arrears of £61,588 net of other payments made to him during the period. The delay in paying him his entitlements was acknowledged separately and he was also paid compensation of £12,287 at that time in respect of loss of purchasing power over the period.</P>
    <P>The systems in place in my Department normally ensure that a person's full insurance record is established. In this regard, it should also be pointed out that the pension claim form also includes a number of questions that are designed to enable the Department to ensure that all social insurance contributions are taken into consideration, including a question about any other social welfare payments made to the person. Unfortunately, in this case in responding to this question, the person concerned did not indicate that he had been claiming unemployment assistance. If he had done so, the position could have been rectified at that point. The credits at the heart of the problem in this case were brought to account through paper based clerical procedures which are no longer in use. For some years now, the unemployment assistance payments system has been computerised and all credits due are awarded automatically and updated to an insured person's contribution record.</P>
    <P>I accept that the problem was essentially due to human error in the failure to follow standard procedures on this occasion. I am satisfied that this was an isolated case which arose from totally exceptional circumstances. I was pleased to note from the Ombudsman's report that the number of complaints in respect of my Department had decreased by 55% since 1997 and that the efforts made by the Department in recent years to provide a more client-focused service and the improvements made in areas such as the provision of information to clients on services and decisions contributed to this decrease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two directives relating to my Department awaiting transposition into Irish law. They are Council Directive 98, 49, EC on the safeguarding of the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the European Community, which was adopted on 29 June 1998, and Council Directive 2000, 43, EC which was adopted on 29 June 2000.</P>
      <P>Directive 98, 49, EC deals with the preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another. It also provides for workers who are posted abroad to be allowed to stay in their occupational schemes and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>Member states are required to comply with the directive not later than 25 July 2001. I am pleased to say that the pensions Act is already largely in compliance with the terms of the directive. The minor changes required to that Act to ensure full compliance will be incorporated in the forthcoming pensions Bill.</P>
      <P>Directive 2000, 43, EC relates to implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. The purpose of the directive is to allow the participation of all persons, natural and legal, in society regardless of racial or ethnic origin. While primary responsibility for its implementation rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the scope of the directive includes social security. Any necessary changes in the social welfare system arising out of this directive will be implemented not later than 19 July 2003, the deadline for compliance with the directive.</P>

      <P>The Department's current staffing complement is 4,125 core posts and 323 temporary posts and, at any particular time, a number of posts are unfilled due to the normal turnover of staff. These vacancies do not have any implications for the implementation of the national development plan. In addition, at any given time, there would be a number of staff performing duties of a higher grade on an allowance basis to cover lengthy staff absences such as maternity leave and term time leave.</P>
      <P>As at 1 May 2001, the overall number of vacancies in the Department was about 158, none of which had been vacant for more than one year. There were some 49 vacancies at the grade of clerical officer, 39 vacancies at the grades of executive officer-staff officer, ten vacancies at higher executive officer level, and six posts vacant in the service grades. There were no vacancies at the higher levels.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the Department's IT division there were some 50 vacancies comprising posts in grades as follows: five higher executive officer-systems analyst, 20 executive officer-junior systems analyst, 21 clerical officer-staff officer programmer and four clerical officer-computer operator.</P>
      <P>There were also four vacancies in professional grades, comprising one mediator and three medical assessors.</P>
      <P>These posts will be filled over the coming months, in some instances from panels set up following competitions conducted by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners and in others by way of internal promotions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 to 232, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated before, there are two legitimate but differing opinions held in relation to the preservation of the <i>Asgard</i>. These are, to conserve the vessel as a static exhibit in a museum, or to restore the vessel to full sailing condition so that it may take to the seas again. Both options were examined by my Department. The Government endorsed my recommendation that the most appropriate manner of preserving the memory of the history of this famous ketch was to have it restored to sail with a view to navigating the seas around Ireland and further afield again. Accordingly, in December 1999 I issued a licence to alter the <i>Asgard </i>in order to facilitate its restoration to full sailing condition.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the <i>Asgard </i>is the property of the Minister for Defence and my sole function in relation to it was the issue of the licence to alter. However, the <i>Asgard </i>restoration project has assured my Department, and the National Museum of Ireland, that it will provide the necessary care and protection due to this historic national treasure.</P>

      <P>A total of 32 applicants were interviewed for seasonal posts as guides-<Col N="1375" /> information officers at Kilkenny Castle on 13 February 2001. Some 17 applicants were successful from these interviews. In early April my Department had insufficient guides available to handle tours at the castle but, none of the persons on the panel were available to start work. A further application for seasonal work was handed in by an individual to Kilkenny Castle on 3 April 2001. This person was interviewed on 10 April 2001 and was placed on the successful panel. She was available to start work immediately and commenced employment on 11 April 2001.</P>
      <P>The advertisements for seasonal guides-information officers at Kilkenny Castle were placed in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> on 10 November 2000. In addition, further advertisements for seasonal guides-information officers nation-wide were placed in the <i>Irish Independent </i>on 9 November 2000; the<i> Irish Times</i> on 10 November 2000 and in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 12 November 2000. FÁS was notified and asked to carry posters in each FÁS office nationwide. Formal internal notice was not given as the posts concerned were offered on a seasonal basis only.</P>
      <P>The standard procedure referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 158 of 6 December 2000 was not relevant in this case as that procedure refers to the employment of permanent guides only.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may wish to learn that my Department in consultation with the fire authorities is examining the possibility of providing funding to assist with the cost of installing smoke alarms and fire extinguishers in premises on the islands that do not possess fire fighting services.

      <P>RTE reports that good quality reception of TG4 is generally available in the Achill area from its local transmitter. However, RTE states that unfortunately, Owenduff and parts of Tonragee cannot receive TG4 from the Achill transmitter because they are shadowed by a local hill. RTE advises that viewers wishing to receive TG4 in this area should have a UHF aerial and mast-head amplifier installed for RTE's Sligo transmitter. Viewers in the area may wish to consider this advice. However, anyone contemplating this type of installation should satisfy themselves that the equipment will be effective in the individual case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is serving a three year prison sentence for a variety of offences, including assault with intent to rob, assault on a garda and the unauthorised taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle. With standard remission he is due for release on 13 April 2002.</P>
      <P>On 5 April 2001 he was reported to the governor of Cork Prison for allegedly breaching prison discipline and the matter was dealt with under Rule 68 of the Rules for Government of Prisons, 1947. The governor awarded him a sanction of loss of privileges for two months which included loss of visits for this period. He was refused a visit with his mother on 26 April 2001 for this reason alone. He was subsequently transferred to Wheatfield Place of Detention on 28 April 2001 for routine operational reasons to reallocate cell space.</P>
      <P>The Director General of the Prisons Service has informed me that the person referred to has been seen on several occasions by medical staff in both Cork Prison and Wheatfield Place of Detention. I am not at liberty to disclose specific medical details. However, I am informed that his condition is satisfactory and does not present any cause for concern.</P>
      <P>The Director General has also informed me that the governor of Wheatfield Place of Detention has restored all privileges and will facilitate visits to this prisoner from family members in the normal way.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mountjoy Prison, like almost all of our older prison stock, is long overdue major refurbishment. Many parts of the prison are largely unchanged since the 1850s. The absence of in-cell sanitation throughout large sections of the prison is a particular concern in this regard. I have been in a position to ensure the commencement of refurbishment programmes in some of our other older prisons such as Limerick and Cork. Mountjoy, however, due to its location and the fact that the site accommodates four separate institutions is unique. Any major development there must be planned on an integrated basis with the overall needs of the prison service and the criminal justice system in <Col N="1381" /> mind. It is also a fact that much of the development of the site over the last 20 to 30 years or so has been carried out on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, often in response to short-term requirements and difficulties such as vast overcrowding due to lack of investment in prison spaces in the past.</P>
      <P>In late 1999, therefore, I approved the establishment of the Mountjoy complex redevelopment group as a consultative body to plan the development of the complex and custodial regimes in the redeveloped prison. The group consists of a multidisciplinary team of officials from areas that deal with the complex and its prisoners. The terms of reference of the group included a commitment to: develop a complete description of the treatment and custodial regimes that will be required for the target population to be detained in Mountjoy Prison; identify the strengths, assets and potential of Mountjoy Prison and the Mountjoy Prison complex within the whole prison and probation system and also the wider community and outline a plan for achieving an optimum regime; prepare an outline description with drawings of a building that would meet the requirements which have been identified.</P>
      <P>I have since received two reports from the group, both of which I have published. The group's second report was published, with my approval, last month. It contains a number of specific proposals and recommendations for the future development and use of the Mountjoy complex, which currently comprises Mountjoy Prison, the Training Unit, St. Patrick's Institution and the Female Prison. The proposed new development will accommodate up to 723 prisoners, excluding the Female Prison, committed from the courts in the Leinster area in house units rather than in the traditional cell blocks. The complex will contain separate induction and pre-release facilities as well as adjoining &ldquo;halfway house&rdquo; accommodation for pre-release and newly released offenders. Overall, the complex will assume a pivotal role in drug treatment service provision in the prison system. A full range of services, including chaplaincy, welfare, education and vocational training for prisoners, will also be provided on an integrated basis within the complex.</P>
      <P>Architecturally, what is proposed is not dissimilar to the new Female Prison which was opened in 1999. Overall, the design of the buildings will maximise the potential afforded by open space and light with an emphasis on reducing the institutional effect while maintaining security. The most historical architectural features at the prison, including the central block and the landmark twin granite chimney towers, would be retained under this plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since publication of the latest group report, I have asked the Prisons Service to expand its review and planning activity to address the major overflow problem emerging at the Dóchas Centre, Mountjoy. Committals of women to prison from the courts have exceeded all expectations <Col N="1382" /> over the past few months. Despite doubling the number of spaces for women prisoners, committals on remand especially have surged beyond any past experience. Whatever the cause, and many factors are at play here, the Prisons Service must and will make adequate provision for this group in the shorter term.</P>
    <P>An estimate of the capital cost of construction and of the operation of the proposed development is being prepared. When this is available and having considered various views expressed on the proposal, I intend to bring the matter to Government for approval to proceed with the first phase of the development. I expect that the entire project will take approximately eight years to complete.</P>
    <P>I confirm my intention to engage in consultations with all interested parties, including the staff and residents in the area, who may be affected by the development over the coming years.</P>

These will standardise the construction of PE halls at second level <Col N="1394" /> schools and will reduce the architectural planning processes considerably. The templates are being piloted in four schools initially and are expected to be available later this year for generic use.</P>

      <P>There are two EU directives awaiting transposition into Irish law through my Department. Directive 2000/5/EC amends Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and <Col N="1395" /> training to supplement Council Directive 89/48/EEC. This directive, which came into effect in January 2000, will be transposed into Irish law by means of a statutory instrument. The provisions of the directive provide that member states must have adopted the necessary provisions to comply with the directive by 27 February 2001. In this context the procedures for the transposition of the directive into Irish law are under way and it is envisaged that these will be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Directive 1999/42/EC provides for the establishment of a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the directives on liberalisation and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications. This directive, which came into effect in January 1999, will also be transposed into Irish law by means of a statutory instrument. It is envisaged that this will take place within the timescale set out in the directive whereby member states must adopt the necessary provisions to comply with the directive before 31 July 2001.</P>

    <P>One post at senior architect level is filled on an acting-up basis. Three posts have been vacant for more than one year, one at senior architect level and two at architect level.</P>
    <P>The planning and building unit of my Department has worked to full capacity in relation to funding allocated for the projects within its remit. In 2000 the capital allocation was £313.9 million and this allocation was fully expended. It is anticipated that the 2001 allocation will be fully expended. Private sector design teams are regularly used by my Department to ensure the timely completion of projects.</P>
    <P>In the case of any one project, apart from the role of the design team, the progress to successful completion depends on a number of factors. Chief among these are the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the availability of funding, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.</P>
    <P>In summary, progress on delivery of the national development plan is not adversely affected by the staffing position.</P>
    <P>The resource needs in the area of professional and technical support in the planning and building unit of my Department are currently under review. The review is taking place in the context of the wider review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs, conducted by Mr. Sean Cromien, former Secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The mix of professional and technical grades in the building area and the precise number in each grade will not be finally determined until the change agenda for that area is agreed as it will inevitably involve a considerable refocusing of the role of such grades. The implementation of the programme of change will of course proceed on a partnership basis.</P>
