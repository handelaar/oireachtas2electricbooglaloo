      <P>I wish to inform the House that with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery is the chairman of the Slovakian Parliament, Mr. Josef Migas. He is accompanied by parliamentarians from the Parliament in Bratislava. It is an honour for me to extend to you, Mr. Chairman, and to your delegation a warm welcome to Dáil Éireann. Your visit significantly increases co-operation and friendship between our Parliaments and our countries and I look forward to a further strengthening of those links which are to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the loss of 119 jobs at Foxtec Ireland Limited, Mullingar, County Westmeath, and the need for the Government to establish a task force to find an alternative industry for this factory.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the serious implications for employment in Westmeath of the loss of 119 jobs at Foxtec Ireland Limited, Mullingar, and the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to request the job creation agencies to make particular efforts to find replacement employment for these and other jobs lost in the <Col N="874" /> area in recent months.

That is correct, every Member can have his or her views. It was suggested that a committee of the House does not represent all parties of the House and Members on a constitutional matter and that it is unprecedented for a constitutional amendment not to be debated in the Dáil so that all Members and parties have an opportunity to table amendments, voice their opinions and have their votes recorded. Members went on and on about that issue. I accept that we said in the letter <Col N="880" /> that we would try to take all Stages in the House but the weeks&mdash;</P>

      <P>If further evidence of the Government's incompetence was needed, the INTO survey on primary schools provides it. Out of 73 schools, one third had inadequate toilet facilities, 50% had inadequate hand washing and drying facilities, 40% have no proper heating system, 47% have rotting windows and doors and 71% have inadequate or unsafe school yards. Will the Taoiseach agree that at the end of a period of unprecedented prosperity, it is a frightful indictment of the Government that 73 primary schools are unsafe for both teachers and pupils because of the neglect of the Government and its lack of prioritisation in public spending? If ever a boom was squandered, this one has been squandered by the Government when children in primary schools have to live and learn in such conditions.</P>

      <P>On the same topic, as a former Minister for Finance and as someone who is per<Col N="892" /> ipherally involved in the economic management of this economy, having ceded that to both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, perhaps the Taoiseach might explain the reason the increase in capital funds barely matches that of the rate of inflation in the construction industry and, in some cases, is below it. At a time when there is a downturn in the construction industry and a forecast that approximately 1,500 jobs will be lost, when there will not be the same output in housing this year compared to last year and where there is spare capacity in the construction industry, why was the golden opportunity of diverting that spare capacity into an area of manifest social need not availed of by the Government? It would be maintaining levels of employment, sustaining the construction industry and providing the sort of facilities we can now afford and to which our children are entitled. Why has the Taoiseach acquiesced to a conservative management of the economy that will exacerbate the economic cycle rather than assuage it?</P>

      <P>While the debate on whether the economy is going into recession will continue for some time, there is no doubt now that we are facing a major fiscal crisis. Just 12 months ago, the Government projected a surplus of £3.5 billion and anybody with any competence in economics would say now that we cannot have a budget with borrowing of less than £1 billion, so the fiscal situation has deteriorated by £4.5 billion in a 12 months period. The Government has squandered the boom and there are 800 schools awaiting approval for various projects.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn to something over which the Taoiseach has direct control, if he chooses to exercise it. I refer to the threat of the loss of 150 jobs in FLS at Dublin Airport in north County Dublin, an area that has been abandoned by the Taoiseach and his party. FLS was formally TEAM Aer Lingus. FLS has been informed by Sikorsky that in return for it securing a contract to supply five helicopters from the Air Corps, it <Col N="894" /> would offset, as is the practice in the business across the western world, a sum of £72 million in return for a favourable reception on their contract tender, which would at least secure 50 jobs in Dublin Airport. There seems to be some conflict in the various Departments as to whether this is acceptable, and I am aware that the Secretary General of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, David Begg, has written to the Taoiseach, in no uncertain terms, highlighting the necessity for some creative, innovative response from the Taoiseach in this respect. If the Taoiseach took one day off his frantic tours around the country for photo opportunities, sat behind his desk and examined the practice in other countries, listened to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to others about the opportunity on which he alone as Taoiseach can intervene, and accepted the offset, which is an established practice in the defence procurement industry, for the&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from Deputy Quinn's question, I remind the Taoiseach that the Minister for Defence announced, on a number of occasions, the purchase of helicopters for the Air Corps. Was that an exercise in imagination or is there a commitment to purchase helicopters? If so, why is it not done in the manner suggested by Deputy Quinn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Minister for Defence to purchase helicopters. The Minister has issued the tenders, of which there are four. There are rules about tendering. Applications have been put in by more than one com<Col N="895" /> pany, not just FLS, about offsetting arrangements. The Minister has to take into account all of those details. This is a difficult area. In the normal course of events, I could imagine what would happen if a Minister got tenders and those tenders were substantially different. I will not give the details of this case, in case people think it is a simplistic view. However, if tender No. 2 was to get the contract rather than tender No. 1 because the Minister said it was an offset, and the Minister then had to quantify that offset to this House to satisfy what tender No. 3 might have, whose offset might be bigger, I could imagine where the file would end up. Having said that, the Minister, myself and all our colleagues are very conscious of the difficulties in FLS and of its employment potential. The Minister will explore all avenues open to him within rules, guidelines and regulations to try to deal with this matter. It is not simply a matter of comparing offsets and ruling that, for example, tender No. 4 is suddenly tender No. 1. It does not work that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with recent reports in the newspapers that counter trading is common practice in defence procurement? A recent newspaper report cited at least six European states, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Norway, in which the Governments have been engaged in this practice. While there is a precedent for it, I respect the Taoiseach's comments on transparency and tenders. We should have transparency.</P>
      <P>I ask him to repeat the entire process and invite offsets along the lines described to ensure we get the best deal in terms of the equipment the Air Corps needs and the best offset for securing jobs in FLS, formerly TEAM Aer Lingus. There is no problem with the proper procedure for tenders. I would be pleased to contemplate implementing again the whole process, including offsets, to make sure there will not be accusations of favouritism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct, other countries are doing this. He will also agree that the practice is common not only to defence expenditure, but in all other matters. Perhaps we are slightly more self-righteous or correct in this area. Other countries take a different view. In France consideration is given to a company's ability to contribute to contracts other than the one for which it tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtually every Member of the House has lobbied for one or other of the companies involved. There has been more lobbying on this contract than for many contracts of late, which creates considerable difficulties for the Minister. The Minister is also actively looking at the possibility, which Deputy Quinn raised in his final point. While the matter deserves close attention, we do not want to lose too much time on it. We need to adhere to one definition of offsetting because as soon as word reached the other companies that <Col N="896" /> one company was offsetting, of course, they came back. This creates difficulties. The Minister for Defence has the money and is anxious to move on the issue. The Air Corps badly needs the equipment. We will examine the Deputy's proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the amendments were circulated, but I would be happy if additional copies were produced.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are concerned with enshrining in law the current practice which permits applicants to submit amendments to their applications for registration of designs. These amendments may only be submitted prior to registration with the approval of the Controller. It is left unqualified that this power to amend design applications could be used in an anti-competitive manner to lay claim to ownership of others' designs by changing the design and invoking the earlier filing date to claim ownership thereof. That potentially undermines the entire system of registered design protection. My legal advice is that, given the importance of the provision, it is advisable to incorporate this provision in the primary law, rather than rely on provisions in secondary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21, as with the final element of the previous amendment, seeks to ensure that where the Controller has refused an application for registration of a design &ndash; as opposed to the last amendment which deals with requests by applicants for changes to applications prior to registration &ndash; and amendment to the design appli<Col N="902" /> cation is subsequently permitted by the Controller, that does not significantly alter the design in question in order that the design may be registered, then the application shall retain its original filing date. This relates to amendments Nos. 2 and 3 and to sections 20 and 21.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions are effectively to protect the original copyright? Somebody cannot, by making a marginal change to a design, attempt to claim an entirely new copyright.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going back to the fundamental elements of this intellectual property legislation. In terms of design, we are talking about the shape of a product. In the Seanad we spoke of the appearance of a product that is the subject of industrial design as distinct from the function of the product. We have discussed many aspects of intellectual property legislation here in recent years such as copyright legislation, patent protection and during the Deputies' time in Government they dealt with the trademark law. Industrial design refers to the appearance of a product. A typical example is the shape of the Coca Cola bottle.</P>

      <P>The amendment is proposed in the interest of legal clarity and as a contribution to making the Bill more user friendly. The key change proposed is the insertion of the terminology &ldquo;that the error in question shall be deemed never to have been made&rdquo; rather than retaining the current text which provides that &ldquo;the correction shall have effect as if it had originally been made in its correct form&rdquo;. I am concerned that the current text may be ambiguous and the amendment I propose will make it absolutely clear that the designs register can be amended to remove errors entirely. It is a purely technical amendment.</P>

      <P>(<i>e</i>) the insertion of the following after section 78&ndash;</P>
      <P>78A. (1) The copyright in a design document or model recording or embodying a design for anything other than an artistic work or a typeface is not infringed by the making of a product to the design or the copying of a product made to the design.</P>
      <P>(2) The copyright in a design document or a model recording or embodying a design for anything other than an artistic work or a typeface is not infringed by the issue to the public, or the inclusion in a film, broadcast or cable programme service, of anything the making of which is, by virtue of <i>subsection</i> (<i>1</i>), not an infringement of that copyright.</P>
      <P>(3) In this section and section 78B&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;design&rdquo; means the design of any aspect of the shape or contours (whether internal or external) of the whole or part of a product, other than surface decoration; </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;design document&rdquo; means any record of a design, whether in the form of a drawing, <Col N="905" /> a written description, a photograph, storing the work in any medium or otherwise; </P>
    <P>&ldquo;product&rdquo; means any industrial or handicraft item, including parts intended to be assembled into a complex product, packaging, get-up, graphic symbols and typographical typefaces, but not including computer programmes; and </P>
    <P>&ldquo;complex product&rdquo; means a product which is composed of multiple components which can be replaced permitting disassembly and re-assembly of the product.</P>
    <P>78B (1) This section applies where an artistic work has been exploited, by or with the authorisation of the copyright owner, by&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)making by an industrial process products falling to be treated for the purposes of this Part as copies of the work, and </P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments proposed in <Col N="906" /> respect of paragraphs (c), (d) and (f) are technical in nature. Paragrahs (c) and (d) dimply replace the reference in the relevant provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, to the Industrial and Commercial Property Act, 1927, which is being repealed by the Industrial Designs Bill, with reference to this industrial design legislation. They are in essence transitional provisions to ensure the safe legal passage between one system of law and another.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>f</i>) simply extends the protection afforded under copyright law to the designs of typefaces in respect of industrial production of those typefaces on articles from 15 to 25 years to reflect the extension of designs under this Bill to 25 years.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>e</i>), however, is a substantive insertion into the copyright law that is required to clarify in that law the type of protection that is to be afforded to the documents and models in which designs are first recorded prior to their incorporation in products. This current Industrial Designs Bill is only concerned with protecting designs once they have been applied to products and does not address sketched diagrams or other recording of designs, including electronic recordings, before they are so applied.</P>
      <P>Under current Irish law, design documents only qualify for copyright protection where they are not used or intended to be used as models or patterns to be applied industrially to products. Where they are so used, all copyright protection is denied, giving rise to concerns about compliance with our obligations under the Berne Convention to protect, in particular, artistic works. It is necessary to update the law to provide greater legal clarity and reflect the experience of legislators, especially in the UK, in this very complex area of law.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>g</i>) is a consequential amendment arising from the introduction of the new provisions to the Copyright and Related Rights Act. The current text of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, contains a provision in subsection (2) of section 79 that deals with an aspect of the overlap between copyright protection and protection of industrial design by registration. It essentially permits industry to make products incorporating a design once the copyright owner has allowed the design to be used on industrial products. This provision is no longer required once the terms of amendment No. 7 are in place because the relationship between copyright and protection of industrial designs by registration are comprehensively covered in that amendment. I trust this explains in a practical manner the complexity of the issues at stake and I trust Deputies will agree that the proposed amendments are not only welcome but that they are necessary insertions in our copyright law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the definition of complex product in amendment No. 7? It states it is a &ldquo;product which is composed of multiple components which can be replaced permit<Col N="907" /> ting disassembly and re-assembly of the product.&rdquo;. Does this cover copyright in relation to the design of buildings or architecture, or is there any way in which the interpretation of this could be applied to the intellectual copyright of the design of buildings, including pre-fabricated buildings, which are capable of being dismantled and reassembled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely disappointing that we do not have the chance to discuss the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill on Report Stage. Having a guillotine on the Bill today is totally inappropriate. There are very serious consequences for the staff of Ordnance Survey Ireland and many of the amendments to be debated here today will reflect the concerns of <Col N="908" /> staff. Because of the guillotine, the Bill will be dealt with in two minutes. It is ludicrous that it should happen in this way.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister for Finance is in a position to say he will withdraw Report Stage today and return to it at some other time, perhaps next week or the week after. There is no great rush. There are a few fundamental points about which that staff are concerned &ndash; possible relocation from Dublin, possible relocation from offices in the provinces, and the fundamental issue of there being a worker director on a State company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on the Order of Business, I propose that the Bill in its entirety be recommitted under Standing Order 120. I will explain the reasons for this. Three amendments have been tabled on Report Stage which were only circulated late last night which propose to amend the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. They are substantial amendments, especially amendment No. 11. Given that the time allocated to this debate is very short and that there will be a guillotine, it is likely we will not discuss these proposals and that we will be asked to amend substantially other completely different legislation, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, without discussing these amendments. This is unacceptable in terms of our duties as parliamentarians. The entire Bill should be recommitted.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 transfers the onus of proof on to the person accused by amending legislation with which we are not dealing. We are discussing the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, 2000. It is proposed to amend substantially the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, without any substantive debate in the House, by transferring the onus of proof on to the person accused. It is not appropriate that we should do this and I expect the Minister of State to agree with me.</P>
      <P>I also question whether these amendments are in order on Report Stage because they do not arise from Committee proceedings and bear no relation to what was discussed then. If either I or Deputies Timmins or Enright tabled amendments which did not arise from Committee proceedings, we would be ruled out of order. To my knowledge, these amendments have not been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>It would be a dereliction of our duties as parliamentarians to amend completely without discussion or debate other legislation not being discussed by the House and, in effect, change a fundamental principle of justice relating to the onus of proof. Therefore, I propose, in the interests of our parliamentary duties to scrutinise legislation, that the entire Bill be recommitted.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Sullivan. Discussion on the Bill is scheduled to conclude at 5 p.m. It is now almost 1.30 p.m. when the sitting will be suspended. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that we will not even reach the substantial amendment No. 11 which is three and a half pages long. Committee Stage of the Bill was taken before the summer recess, when half the amendments were discussed, and last week, yet the first we saw of this amendment was last night. There was no reference to it on Committee Stage. <Col N="913" /> I support the point Deputy O'Sullivan made. It is unacceptable to conduct business in this manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the motion proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan and on which Deputy Timmins spoke. Significant consideration was given to these issues on Committee Stage, both in June when I was present and last week when the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was present. Significant consideration was given to the various issues which strikes me as a good reason for not recommitting the Bill. All these issues were discussed in full on Committee Stage. The amendments tabled were largely discussed on Committee Stage except for the new ones. I accept there are a few new issues.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 was in the Bill as originally published and went to Committee Stage. The amendment arose from Committee deliberations. I intend to recommit the Bill in respect of amendments Nos. 13 and 28 and this will afford Deputies sufficient time to discuss the issues involved. I accept these deal with the inclusion of a new section in the Criminal Justice Act to oblige banks and other financial institutions to report transactions which have a connection with any country which the Minister may designate for that purpose. A country may be designated where the Minister forms the opinion that it does not have sufficient provisions in place to detect and prevent money laundering. This can be debated in what will be effectively a Committee Stage debate when we reach it.</P>
      <P>The second amendment makes provisions for auditors who are obliged to report indications that a company may have committed an offence under the Act to have immunity from civil liability in respect of such disclosures. I also intend to recommit the Bill in respect of this amendment when we reach it in the ordinary course of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time allocated is until 5.15 p.m. I am certainly willing to move as quickly as possible on all the other amendments which have been dealt with already and to facilitate Members to move <Col N="914" /> quickly to reach the new amendments which are of concern. It was not possible to table the amendments on Committee Stage because we were waiting for the advice of the Attorney General on new issues and the draft heads. We have commitments to put in place by 1 January measures to prevent money laundering arising from the recommendations of the task force, something which we are all committed to doing. This is the procedure by which we can do so. If we begin the debate and move through the amendments which come before the ones of interest and debate, we can reach the amendments at issue in the ordinary course of events, recommit the Bill in respect of amendments Nos. 13 and 28, and move forward with the rest of the Bill. I appreciate the genuine interest of Deputies who were very active on Committee Stage, but we will have the time if we move forward as planned to recommit the Bill and discuss them.</P>

Therefore, to debate them on Report Stage is totally out of order. I could not table those amendments and neither could Deputies Timmons and Quinn, yet the Minister of State can now do so.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the president of the university, on Wednesday, 7 November, I addressed the Forum of Public Affairs at the Kennedy school in Harvard. In the course of my address, I expressed my solidarity and the solidarity of the people of Ireland with the American people over the 11 September atrocities. I restated our position that those who perpetrated the attacks could not be allowed to succeed and that we would continue to work with the international community to combat the threat of terrorism. My address also allowed me an opportunity to speak, and to respond to questions, about Northern Ireland and our continuing efforts to achieve progress through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 8 November, I met President Bush and other senior US officials, including the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, at the White House. During our discussion, the President reiterated his support for the peace process and welcomed the progress that is being made. He expressed his continued readiness, despite the enormous pressures which he faces in pursuing the war against international terrorism following the 11 September outrages, to assist us in every way possible in our efforts in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> We also discussed the action against Afghanistan, its effect on the ordinary people of Afghanistan and the need for humanitarian relief. The meeting also focused on the Middle East peace process. Later that day I addressed the US Council for Commerce and Industry annual dinner in New York, where I expressed my belief in the strength of the Irish economy and our ability to weather the international downturn.</P>
    <P>On Friday morning I chaired a breakfast meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board, where I briefed members on developments in the peace process. We also had a very useful and welcome exchange on the current economic situation in the US and the Irish economy. Board members gave me their views on the prospects for economic recovery and a useful perspective on the US economy. We also discussed the implications of a downturn for the ICT sector and noted the work of the Advisory Committee on Infocomms, which is reviewing Ireland's strategy in this sector.</P>
    <P>Later that day I met Mayor Giuliani and offered our sincere condolences to the people of New York in the wake of the 11 September tragedy. I also visited the scene of utter devastation at the World Trade Center site. That evening I attended a reception marking the 150th anniversary of All Hallows College at the embassy in Washington. The cost of the visit has yet to be determined. Outstanding invoices will be forwarded to my Department by the Department of Foreign Affairs in due course.</P>
    <P>I met Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin on 24 October. As I said in my statement in the House on 24 October, the decision of the IRA to put a quantity of arms beyond use must be seen as the biggest breakthrough in the peace process since the Good Friday Agreement was ratified, North and South. I would like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate David Trimble and Mark Durkan on their election as First and Deputy First Ministers, and also to congratulate Mark Durkan, whom I met again on Thursday, 15 November, on his appointment as leader of the SDLP, and Bríd Rogers as deputy leader. I wish them well in their new roles.</P>
    <P>I applaud the efforts of the pro-Agreement parties in coming together in a spirit of co-operation to ensure that the challenge to the Good Friday Agreement was successfully addressed. It is now important to move ahead with the full implementation of the Agreement. Stable, uninterrupted and inclusive government is essential for Northern Ireland. I believe that the actions of the Alliance Party and that of the Women's Coalition will be acknowledged by all fair-minded people as a generous and courageous step taken to protect the Agreement.</P>
    <P>A meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council will take place in Dublin on 30 November where I hope we can move forward with the work of these two important bodies established by the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland Secretary of State has <Col N="919" /> announced that the next elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly will be held on 1 May 2003. I hope that the intervening period will be used to good effect and that Northern Ireland will be able to enjoy a period of political stability and progress which will benefit all.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the recent decision of the GAA to delete rule 21. The Good Friday Agreement and the policing arrangements that are being put in place in Northern Ireland are creating the environment where Nationalists and Unionists can live together on the basis of partnership, equality and mutual respect. The deletion of rule 21 is very much consistent with this new beginning and with promoting reconciliation and tolerance in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I met Father Aidan Troy on Thursday, 18 October. I was already acutely aware of the continuing shameful protest and the difficulties being experienced by the children at the Holy Cross school, but I welcomed the first-hand briefing which Father Troy gave me. It is clear that the children of Holy Cross school have had to endure an appalling and unacceptable situation. I welcome recent efforts to help, but more needs to be done quickly to bring this protest to an end.</P>
    <P>I met bilaterally with Prime Minister Blair in the margins of the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on Friday, 19 October, where we discussed issues relating to Northern Ireland and the peace process. We have, of course, kept in touch by telephone since then. We will continue to meet as and when necessary. I look forward to welcoming the Prime Minister to the British-Irish Council meeting in Dublin on 30 November. We will also meet again at the European Council meeting in Laeken, Belgium, in the middle of next month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the protest at Holy Cross school, Ardoyne, continued this morning and that a female protester was arrested. Does he share the view of Nigel Dodds that this 12 week stand-off is about to be resolved? Has he any reason to share that confidence, in view of the ongoing and deteriorating protest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been numerous initiatives to try to make progress on this issue. The main initiative involved David Trimble as First Minister and Seamus Mallon as Deputy First Minister who made efforts some time ago. Efforts have been made by the new members of the Executive to make progress, various intermediaries have been involved and there has been contact between some of the pro-Agreement parties at leadership level to try to make progress. There have also been meetings between negotiating groups. However, there has been no substantive breakthrough. Some progress has been made on each occasion to alleviate the difficulties, but this has not brought about a satisfactory conclusion. That remains the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Unfortunately the level of trust or co-operation between the Ardoyne and Glenbryn residents, or their intermediaries, does not seem to be making any substantive breakthrough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that the Taoiseach answered 26 questions together, but a number of different supplementaries arise. Rather than group these, I will inquire about one issue. As regards the initiative and the welcome, belated action taken by the IRA to commence the process of decommissioning, the Taoiseach was cited by David Trimble on 18 November as saying that the IRA will have to move on the process before the term of office of the de Chastelain commission expires.</P>
      <P>The welcome initiatives taken some weeks ago have led to the re-establishment of the Executive and the resumption of the all-Ireland bodies and the British-Irish Council, even though the council was not affected <i>per se</i>. Has the Taoiseach received any indications from authoritative sources to indicate that we can expect more of the same as regards the putting of arms and armaments, including explosives, beyond use?</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not. I had a short meeting with General de Chastelain which was more a discussion regarding events which had taken place and his assessment of where matters stand, rather than about the future. I have also held some dialogue with the Northern parties, but those discussions were more concerned with policing and progress in that area. The Deputy correctly cited my view. In his very welcome and useful statement General de Chastelain said he would remain engaged with the IRA's representative and hoped progress would continue. That is still what is required, otherwise these issues will keep coming back. It should now be left, successfully I hope, to General de Chastelain and the IRA representative to make ongoing progress. If the process comes up against a date each time, it will destabilise it. My view was to say that last week, rather than wait because every time we come up against these matters we get onto a merry-go-round. In the end it undermines the progress everybody has made. I hope these matters can move on in a calm, organised and low-key manner with General de Chastelain, as originally envisaged by the decommissioning structures. If that happens, we will be able to move on successfully without this issue recurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I seem to be in agreement that it is desirable from everybody's point of view, but particularly from the viewpoint of the Ulster Unionist Party and its current leadership which has a more difficult path to travel in maintaining support than other parties in Northern Ireland, that the process commenced by the IRA will continue under its own timetable. I hope it will be concluded by next February, but presumably if not by then, the de Chastelain commission's remit can be renewed. Will the Taoi<Col N="921" /> seach confirm this? My information is to the effect that it is a renewable contract, so to speak. We need to avoid the inevitability of deadlines with all the consequent pressure that would bring. May I take it that there is, in effect, no end of February deadline? May I also take it that, if needs be, the commission's term can be extended in order to remove that deadline, and that the IRA knows what it needs and should continue to do it in its own manner? The Taoiseach said General de Chastelain told him he remains engaged with the IRA. Can I interpret his reply as another way of saying we can reasonably expect further initiatives, or is that pushing it too far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>General de Chastelain obviously intends to remain engaged and, having made a major breakthrough, hopes to continue to make progress. The parties hope the remit issue can be dealt with if it arises, and I think it can be. Following the major breakthrough in October, the context for dealing with the arms issue is clear. The best way of doing so is through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is for the politicians to get on with the political process within the structures of the agreement, thus allowing General de Chastelain to engage with the IRA representative on the other issues. I would like to be able to tell the House that it has all been agreed, but that is not the case. However, I have no reason to believe that will not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in welcoming the decision by the GAA to remove rule 21 from its constitution. In view of the fact that the rule has now been removed, will the Taoiseach join me in calling on Mr. Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin to support the new policing arrangement in Northern Ireland and reverse their decision not to encourage young Catholics to join the police force? The Taoiseach may be aware of a public meeting in Dublin tonight organised by the organisation, Justice for the Forgotten. Will he contact the Northern Secretary, Dr. Reid, who has agreed to meet Mr. Justice Barron, although no date has been set for the meeting, to ensure a date will be set as soon as possible? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter, I have welcomed the decision by the GAA's special congress on rule 21. That was a welcome move and I know the GAA has been supportive of this endeavour since 1998. The previous GAA president, Mr. Joe McDonagh, did much of the groundwork for what has now been completed by the current president, Mr. McCague. For people to be able to live side by side with each other in society, a police force is required that is acceptable to everybody and seen to be fair and even-handed. It must also be seen to have support from the various political parties, as well as community groups and the public generally. The Police Service of Northern Ireland was established on 4 October with a new mandate. It will operate <Col N="922" /> under new arrangements, including policing and partnership boards on which the SDLP is represented. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I have worked with the SDLP in making this move. We have done all we can to convince Sinn Féin that it should also move in this direction. We have spent hours on end going through the details of these issues. Sinn Féin is not prepared to do so at this stage, but I believe it will following the implementation plan for legislation promised by the British Government. In the interim, however, if it is Sinn Féin's political objective not to move at this stage, young nationalists should not be prevented from joining the new police service. They should be wished well if they want to do so. If people are to be consistent in seeking an end to violence and paramilitary activity, seeing even-handed justice with people living side by side, and trying to diminish sectarian difficulties in Ardoyne and other areas, then they need a police service. It, therefore, behoves everybody to support such a service which we strongly support. We fought long and hard to reach a satisfactory situation which we felt we could recommend, as everyone in the House has done. We did not recommend it at the start, but fought to get back as close as possible to the Patten proposals, as we believed it was essential to do. We have now achieved this; the policing and partnership boards are in place. If people feel they cannot join, they should at least be clear on their support for those who wish to join the police force. Those who have applied to join, and those who have already joined, should not face difficulties from anybody.</P>

Léiríonn seo an-mhisneach agus an-mhuinín and that bravery and trust are the qualities needed more than ever. Does the Taoiseach, like me, thank God that we are not expressing sympathy to the victims of large-scale carnage in Armagh? I compliment those involved in preventing that potential atrocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> My question is about the discussions held with the Alliance Party about reviewing the electoral systems in the Northern Assembly. Does the Taoiseach know if progress has been made on that matter and when the promised review of electoral systems in the Assembly will be carried out? If work is ongoing, will the Government and the Opposition parties be involved or consulted? Both the Taoiseach and Martin Mansergh know the Green Party's interest in the area of inclusive consensus building and proportionate decision-making procedures. Will there be consultation with Members of the Opposition about a review of electoral systems either in the Northern Assembly or in this House? </P>

      <P>I welcome what the Deputy said in the first part of his contribution. I am sure what everyone has said will be appreciated outside the House by the GAA and its authorities.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Alliance Party and the Women's Coalition did, which was done on the basis that there would be a review. It is a Strand One review under Clause 36. I understand the consultation process has already commenced. The Secretary of State will organise that. Given that it is Strand One, we will not have any direct involvement in it. If the Deputy or his party has any views on it or an input to make, they should be forwarded. I do not see any difficulty with that.</P>

      <P>Now that the new policing arrangements are in place in Northern Ireland, Rule 21 has been abolished by the GAA and decommissioning has started, will the Taoiseach raise the matter of punishment beatings with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland in an effort to eliminate this continuing and barbaric process? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes. There is still a disturbing number of attacks and a number of issues in both areas. As the Deputy is aware, there have been a number of serious events on both sides recently, particularly in loyalist areas. One of the big issues with which we must contend is trying to get the loyalist political movements back into position. There have been a number of serious attacks in recent weeks, perhaps not every night at this time of the year, although that was the case during the summer. Whether they are republican or loyalist, they are of major concern and we will continue to highlight those issues. It is unacceptable that people take the law into their own hands. They do not have the support of a democratic system. We will continue to raise that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Taoiseach's brief discussions with President Bush, did he receive a commitment from the President about future economic and political help for the peace process in Northern Ireland? Did he meet any of the Irish charitable organisations in New York and, if so, <Col N="924" /> did they seek financial aid to help some of the Irish victims of 11 September? Is it the Government's intention to provide further aid to Irish charitable organisations which are helping the victims of 11 September? I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs did so last September when he was there. Does the Taoiseach believe it would be appropriate to respond in that way because of the support we have received from the US over the years, particularly in recent years? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Deputy's second question first. I met a number of the groups at the functions I attended. I did not have individual meetings with them in the short time I was there. They were grateful for the resources they received from the special provision in September. They did not make any application or demand for further funds. They appreciate the ongoing efforts. There is another initiative involving Trina Vargo, Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation for the fire fighters and the police service. All the initiatives have been well received. We will continue to work with those agencies. They will be glad of whatever support we give them. They have accepted the financial aid they have received for which they are grateful.</P>
      <P>As regards the meeting with President Bush, he is still determined to honour what he said last year that at a suitable time he intends to bring his senior members of the Administration to an economic forum. The date and timing of that has now been changed, given the changed circumstances. It would probably have been in early spring, but that will be pushed back now for obvious reasons. However, it is the wish of the Administration to co-operate and attend an economic forum on some date next year which will be fronted by some of the major groups and done on an all-island basis, particularly to include the parties in Northern Ireland. It will not be unlike the one which happened previously. The working arrangements for that have not been worked through, but it will happen next year, although it will probably be later rather than earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach two separate questions, both of which are related to Northern Ireland. The first refers to the position of people who were effectively expelled from Northern Ireland by the republican movement or, in some limited cases, by loyalist paramilitaries. I am most familiar with people who were driven out of Northern Ireland by the IRA or the republican movement without due process of any kind. I understand &ndash; the Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong &ndash; that republican suspects, who were referred to as OTRs, were given an amnesty as part of the response by the British authorities to the initiative taken by the IRA in October to commence the process of decommissioning and putting arms beyond use. Have the British and Irish Governments requested from the republican movement an initiative or response similar to the <Col N="925" /> amnesty or pardon for OTRs so that those families who were driven out of Northern Ireland in an illegal way for whatever reason by the republican movement could now receive a signal to the effect that the threat to their lives or limbs no longer exists in the context of an improved situation where community policing is now a possible reality? </P>
      <P>My second question relates to the forthcoming meeting of the North-South Council and the British and Irish Government Councils. Would it be possible, particularly with the all-Ireland bodies, given that we are looking at a period of at least 18 months of continuity in the North and reasonable continuity in the South in terms of shared areas of agreement, to identify a work programme for the two Executives on the island? Perhaps at the forthcoming meeting, which will be held in a week or so, an indication would emerge as to the type of areas the Government here and the Executive in Northern Ireland intend to pursue and the priorities they have over the next 18 months, which may perhaps be broken into three six month periods. Is that possible and, if not, does the Taoiseach agree it would be useful for the purpose of reintroducing a degree of certainty, confidence and predictability into the workings and the programmes of the two Governments? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with fighting the OTR case. I raised the point many times as I fought the OTR case, that people who were intimidated and had to leave their homes should not be held hostage to the circumstances in which we now live and they should be able to return home. Statements have been made by republican leaders on those matters. However, there are groups some of whom I have met &ndash; it is about a year since I met the last group &ndash; who are concerned about this matter. We have made it clear that in our efforts to see the OTR cases dealt with, we want to see any people who were wrongly forced from their homes and their communities being able to return. That is an issue we will continue to raise. I understand that in many communities there is a bad situation, but having said that, I have no doubt that the case on OTRs is valid in these circumstances, and should equally apply where people have been driven away and driven underground in other countries. They should be allowed to return home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy's second question, we would be glad to do that. As I said in my reply, what the institutions need is a fair run. They need a sustained period of normality where the Good Friday agreement can be implemented. We had agreed previously, that we would try to deal with a range of issues. We sought to share out the burden so that different parts of the British-Irish Council would take a lead on various items. Our lead item was the drugs problem in all its forms because it is increasingly affecting Northern Ireland along with many other countries. That is <Col N="926" /> an issue we will discuss on Friday week. We had logged in some other issues, but I agree that we should have a clear period to allow bilateral meetings to take place, smaller groupings to meet, and to allow for more communication between all of the groupings that make up the British-Irish Council rather than just the two Governments. That would be helpful to all of us in building relationships and to Northern Ireland and David Trimble if we were to proceed in that way. I will ensure in the next period that items are assigned so that different people can take the lead at meetings during the next year or 18 months.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said he met the Irish-American economic advisory board in New York? What advice did it give him about the future direction of the American economy, the prospects for growth next year and the prospects of American investment in Ireland? Will he outline the membership of that board? Has it changed over the years? It has been there for about eight years and I understand it was put in place by Deputy Albert Reynolds. Is the board reflective of where investment is coming from in America? For example, is there somebody on the board from the Silicon Valley and from the southern part of the United States?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put out the names of the board recently enough. The board has existed for almost ten years. Two or three years ago Ambassador Ó hUigín put in a great deal of effort with IDA in America and Enterprise Ireland to get some new people on to the board that reflected both the next generation and some of the upcoming Irish business leaders. Most of the other members are still active although some have retired and moved on. It is still a very representative group and has a high level group of extremely important corporate executives. The embassy and IDA Ireland are always on the look-out for senior ranking people. They are all presidents or chief executive officers of their companies and give of their time. The proceedings of the meetings are never made public. This reflects the confidential nature of the board and the fact that members participate in a private capacity &ndash; not representing their company &ndash; and on a voluntary basis. Many are well known and travel back and forward here. Many of them are extremely well known to Members. They have come on to the board during the life of successive Governments and put in an enormous amount of effort and work not only at the board meetings but on other issues also. The Advisory Committee on Infocomms is chaired by Brian Thompson. He gives an enormous amount of time to it as he did to ICTs and other issues in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got a good assessment of the American economy from them. As in any group in economic business anywhere, there would not be just one message or one voice. They would not necessarily all agree. The board members emphasised that <Col N="927" /> the key to economic upturn was consumer confidence which is shattered in the United States but is beginning to improve somewhat. Perhaps that is linked to the fact that this is Thanksgiving week in America. Their view was that it is hard to predict what will happen. with the interest rates being so low &ndash; they are the lowest since John F. Kennedy's time &ndash; and the enormous impetus of the US budgetary stimulus based on what will happen in international security developments. Their view of what will happen over the next quarter was based on developments in those areas. In the United States they tend to focus on the quarter and on not much longer than that. Their view is that interest rate reductions, stimulus into the economy and international security developments will have an impact.</P>
    <P>Looking at their view of security I can add nothing other than what all Members know. It is all in the public domain day after day. On the US budgetary stimulus, the effect of the money being put into the system is that trillions of dollars are added to the American economy. If the psychological difficulty, which for all the obvious reasons they are suffering, was to abate somewhat &ndash; it will not disappear for obvious reasons and everyone understands that &ndash; the effect of the stimulus to the economy and the low interest rates should generate activity. Business people, manufacturers and the services sector are worried that that could take some time. On the other side the financial people do not think it will take much time. They believe it will move quite quickly.</P>
    <P>The board members, many of whom are big in ICT, pointed out to me that they believe what has happened in ICT where the downturn started last year in the United States was largely due to over investment. That over investment happened in several ways but the dot.com era is moving through the system and while there are substantial losses in it, they believe that industry will improve whether it is infocomms or whatever. The view was that consumer confidence would be crucial. If consumer confidence is restored in the early months of next year they believe they will drive on. If consumer confidence is not restored there will be a more prolonged problem. That is a summary of their assessment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for internal national security is a matter for the Garda Síochána, supported, as appropriate, by the Defence Forces. The security committee, comprising representatives of those agencies at the highest level and their parent Departments, met on the afternoon of the atrocities of 11 September and was augmented by other Departments-agencies concerned. The committee, which has met on a number of occasions since, is primarily concerned with ensuring the Government is advised of high level security issues and the response to them, but not involving operational security issues. The committee is convened by the Secretary General to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I ask supplementaries on this question, I suspect I will run the risk of being told the answer is a secret. Can the Taoiseach give the House an assurance &ndash; I am not being facetious &ndash; that the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is not a member of the committee? It will come as a surprise to many that there is a national security committee and its existence will be welcomed. Will the Taoiseach outline its terms of reference and composition without revealing the identity of any of its members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee does not have formal terms of reference. It must ensure the Government is advised of high level security issues. It has been in place since the start of the problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The heads of the main security Departments and agencies participate in meetings of the committee. There is regular contact between members and heads of other Departments and agencies also contribute, when necessary. Senior members of the Garda Síochána and the Army are key members while others are brought in from time to time.</P>
      <P>The committee does not deal with operational issues. It is a resource for addressing issues that may arise from time to time, including issues of co-ordination between agencies, confidential briefings regarding issues of the security of the State, or issues relating to those involved in subversive activity or trying to subvert the democratic system of the State.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 to 33, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution has, to date, produced five reports, the first dealing with general recommendations, the second dealing with the Seanad, the third dealing with the President, the fourth dealing with the courts and the Judiciary and the fifth dealing with abortion. In these five reports the committee has recommended 55 items for constitutional amendment, of which 16 are of a minor-technical nature.</P>
      <P>The committee's recommendations in relation to the Referendum Commission and local government have been acted on while its recommendation in relation to the abolition of the death penalty in the Constitution was put to the people on 7 June and passed that day.</P>
      <P>I am circulating in the Official Report two tables, one dealing with 39 recommendations contained in the five reports and one dealing with the 16 minor-technical recommendations. The Government is broadly in favour of these recommendations and tried to move forward earlier this year on the recommendations in the fourth report on the courts and the Judiciary, but could not get agreement from the parties in the House. The first report was circulated to all Departments for observations, the fourth to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the fifth to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>As I have said in the House on previous occasions, a way of putting these amendments to the people, in either an omnibus form by grouping them or individually, is being considered by my Department. However, this is not an easy task as the Deputies will appreciate.</P>

However, the matter should be put beyond doubt by explicit statement.</entry>
            <entry>Amend Article 17.1.2º to read: &ldquo;Save in so far as may be provided by specific resolution in each case, the Financial Resolutions of each year passed by Dáil Éireann shall have immediate effect and full force of law provided that legislation confirming any such resolution is enacted within a year&rdquo;.</entry>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that in respect of the sixth report of the committee chaired by his party colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, which was published earlier today, the Government is in significant breach of one of its recommendations regarding the treatment of referenda legislation coming before the House, specifically with regard to the Committee Stage debate on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill? Is the Taoiseach aware of the conclusion on page 37 of the report which I was unable to outline earlier due to interruptions that in order to ensure widespread understanding across the citizenry of this Republic there is an onus on the minority of those of us engaged directly in politics to ensure there is a full and comprehensive debate? Does he not believe the removal of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill in question from the floor of the House to a committee room in the bowels of Leinster House runs contrary to the spirit of that recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a related matter, in order to address that deficit, which perhaps cannot be done by reversing a decision of the order of the House today, does the Taoiseach intend at any stage to speak <Col N="936" /> in the House on the referendum? Does he intend to outline his views on the matter? Does he intend to campaign as vigorously as he did in the Nice treaty referendum?</P>

      <P>In relation to the report, all its recommendations are being examined. With regard to the recommendation to which Deputy Quinn referred, I will not return to political points of the issue. I served my time well on various committees. I recall it was Deputy Quinn's suggestion many years ago, with which I agreed, that parliamentary committees should be used to facilitate more detailed debate. Prior to that the House tended to go through a small section of a Bill on which the debate finished with the tabling <Col N="937" /> of a question on an omnibus of amendments. The Deputy suggested that many more hours debate on Committee Stage would be gained through his initiative. I believe that as I am sure he does and will not cross swords with him again on it.</P>
      <P>A committee of the House may be convened when an issue is interesting enough. We have seen this with regard to CIE related issues. I watched some of its proceedings, as I am sure many others have. That was also the case with the DIRT inquiry which was conducted by a committee. The nation tuned in to watch its proceedings. Unfortunately, not all the proceedings of the committees nor of the House get the same attention.</P>
      <P>I have been present in the House during the years debating various legislation, probably boring myself and others to tears, when there has been an empty Public Gallery and Press Gallery and only a few Members present. There is a view that taking Committee Stage of a Bill in the House will mean that all Members will be engaged and give it their full attention which will lead to a more comprehensive and meaningful dialogue, but I am sure there will be an interesting debate on the amendments about which we talked this morning.</P>

      <P>I remember precisely the time in 1992 when the position changed. I remember there were Schedules to a Bill which, if I recall correctly, related to changes in energy tax, which probably motivated Deputy Quinn's initiative. We would not have reached those Schedules under the normal arrangement because it was an enormous Bill. It was for this reason that the move was made. At the time a committee of the House met in the Seanad chamber. I do not think we have lost anything as a result of that change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several recommendations have been brought forward by the committee. It has done an enormous amount of valuable work, but most of its findings will fall to the next Government to implement. A number of referendums have been held during the lifetime of this Dáil. Useful work has been done, but the major issue is to develop a method of having omnibus referendums. I will try to bring it to that stage in the next six months, but if we deal with the issues in separate refer<Col N="938" /> endums we will never get the programme of constitutional reform that is necessary. The only way to do it is by holding omnibus referendums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne):</NameTxt>
      <P>A succession of short-term licences have been granted since August 2000 for the fishing vessel concerned under section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended. Under this section, the Minister is empowered to grant a fishing vessel licence for any specified time period and under any conditions deemed appropriate and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The short-term licences have been granted subject to, and pending, the outcome of negotiations with the European Commission on a number of interrelated issues. These centre primarily on Ireland's formal application to be credited with additional fleet capacity and effort to take account of new international fishing opportunities. In that context, the negotiations with the Commission have also focused on the separate requirement to reduce the excess power capacity in the pelagic segment to bring the situation into line with existing MGP targets. It had been envisaged throughout that these negotiations would be completed at a much earlier stage. However, the discussions with the Commission have been technically complex and the process has been very prolonged and, at times, frustrating as a result. As with each of the previous short-term licences, the current licence was issued in anticipation of the negotiations being concluded within the time period of the licence. I am hopeful there will be clos<Col N="939" /> ure shortly. We are keeping in close and regular touch with the Commission with the objective of wrapping up matters without further undue delay.</P>
    <P>The vessel is already registered under the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955, on the general register of Irish ships, and I would point out that this of itself is a legal requirement for the vessel concerned. For the process of definitive registry on the Irish register of fishing boats and the EU fishing fleet register to be completed, the matters under negotiation with the Commission need to be finalised satisfactorily. The Commission is fully aware of the status of the vessel and we have made it clear throughout these negotiations that resolution of the matters under discussion is key to completing the licensing and registration process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first sympathise with the Minister of State that it is the Minister who is in Chile today, and not the Minister of State. As far as this vessel is concerned, can I take it the Minister of State has just confirmed it is not on the EU fishing fleet register and that it is not definitively on the Irish fishing fleet register? Is it the case that this vessel was issued with a temporary licence even though, to use the jargon of the trade, it had bought no tonnage? Does the Minister of State agree that is unfair to all of the other vessels definitively on the register, which can be put on the register only when they replace tonnage? If it ever gets to the point where the vessel comes on the register, will 100% or 130% tonnage replacement be required? Is it the case, as reported on the 8th of this month, that the Government has still not provided the Commission with the information it needs to reach a conclusion on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right when he implies that the fishing vessel is not on the Irish register, nor is it on the European register, but all efforts are being made to get it on to both registers. All sea fishing licences are issued under section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended, and it is therefore in order for a Minster to issue a licence under that section for any period of time. The Minister can impose any conditions on a licence, and the reason it has been issued with short-term licences is because we hoped the negotiations with Europe would be completed. To date, however, such negotiations have not been completed but we are in continuous contact with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boat in question is well known to most people and it is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, fishing vessels in the world. The industry, and many other people, complained that we got a small slice of the action when it came to fishing and that we did not have vessels that were capable of venturing to the deep waters. We now have such a vessel and if it gets onto the Irish register, which I expect will be the case, and onto <Col N="940" /> the European register, I hope it will complement the fishing industry here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has not answered my question on tonnage replacement, if and when this vessel is put on the Irish register. Will it be a 100% replacement requirement or will this vessel have to replace a tonnage equivalent to 130% of its rated tonnage? If the Minister had not issued a succession of short-term licences over a period of 16 months to this vessel, a most unprecedented situation, would that capacity have been available to allocate to other vessels on the Irish register?</P>

      <QRef>[28839/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the documentary in question which focused exclusively on the salmon farm industry in Scotland and Norway. The Irish salmon farming industry is, by comparison, very small and much more highly regulated. As the Deputy is aware, there are several schools of expert opinion on the impact of sea lice on wild salmon stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Irish context, stringent management <Col N="941" /> practices and controls for fish farms are kept under continuous review in line with our policy objective to ensure the sustainable development of aquaculture to the highest environmental standards. In line with the conclusions of the Whitaker report, it has been stated policy for over a decade to maintain intensive sea lice management strategies on Irish marine based salmon farms.</P>
    <P>The national sea lice monitoring and control programme has been in place for Irish salmon farms since 1991. We are well ahead of our competitors in this regard. The programme is overseen by the Marine Institute which carries out regular inspection and sampling at all marine finfish sites throughout the year. The sea lice monitoring programme is kept under regular review and the results are disseminated to all interested parties. The programme has been further enhanced, in light of advances in lice control and treatment strategies, by the introduction of a formal sea lice protocol for finfish farmers in 2000. The protocol is part of our overall strategy to maintain and ensure the highest environmental standards for Irish aquaculture.</P>
    <P>Sea lice levels are set with the objective of maintaining levels as close to zero as practicable. The levels determine or trigger the use of approved targeted treatment regimes. I would emphasise that Irish lice control parameters are the most stringent of all salmon producing countries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>I am confident that our strategic approach is paying dividends.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is also aware that the licensing of salmon farms under the 1997 Act is subject to a detailed environmental assessment process which takes account of the wild fisheries and other interests, involves public consultation and includes a fully independent appeals system.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring the Irish salmon farming sector operates to the highest environmental and husbandry standards. Aquaculture development, sustainably and responsibly managed, can live in harmony with wild fisheries and with all users of the marine resource.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been over a decade of research on the incidence of sea lice arising from fish farms and its linkage to the decline in sea trout and wild salmon stocks. After ten years of research and monitoring is the Minister of State now in a position to definitively state whether the incidence of sea lice on fish farms is increasing or decreasing and whether it has caused the decline in the sea trout and wild salmon stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy held office at the Department for a considerable time and by all accounts played a very effective role. My view and that of the Department is that sea lice difficulties have reduced in the past decades. The evidence for this was gathered during visits to salmon farms and discussions with all the interested <Col N="942" /> parties in the various bays in which these farms are located. The arrangements in place are and will continue to be successful. There are still difficulties, but we are on the right road. I hope we will achieve our goal of reducing difficulties to as close to zero as possible so that we hear very little, if anything, about sea lice. We are making progress in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State address the second part of my question which is the link between sea lice and the collapse in sea trout and wild salmon stocks? The research examined in the television programme referred to in the question showed a direct linkage between sea lice and the collapse of wild salmon stocks in Norway and Scotland. What is the Minister of State's view after ten years of research? Can he categorically state that sea lice did not cause the collapse in sea trout and wild salmon stocks here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's forgiveness for missing the second part of his question. My view and the view of the Department is that the incidence of sea lice is decreasing. It is difficult to state with certainty that sea lice were the only cause of the problem we experienced with trout and salmon in 1989 and 1990. In common with the Department and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, I accept without question that sea lice contributed to the problem, but there were other factors.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that the documentary evidence to which the question refers was very one-sided. The Scottish farmers, in particular, put up a trenchant argument against it. I refute entirely the view that this country has the same level of difficulty. We have the most stringent legislation and probably the best regulated industry in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>The five pelagic fishing vessels referred to by the Deputy are licensed under section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended. These licences, were granted subject to and pending resolution of outstanding replacement capacity issues at national and EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing licensing policy, 100% replacement capacity must be provided before vessels in the fleet can be replaced by new vessels. The full replacement capacity has not yet been provided <Col N="943" /> in the case of these five vessels. All five vessel owners have submitted data in support of their cases that the increased tonnage capacity relates exclusively to safety improvements. I am aware, in particular, that two of the vessels concerned were lengthened some years after their introduction into the fleet to address serious stability and operational safety concerns.</P>
    <P>The 100% replacement requirement will be determined in light of decisions by the Commission on applications for safety tonnage credits in each case. Under the 1997 EU Council decision on the fourth multi-annual guidance programme for the EU fleet, increases in capacity resulting exclusively from safety improvements may be credited to individual vessels. These must be justified on a case by case basis and approved by the Commission. My Department has been liaising with the vessel owners on their safety tonnage applications, which are being evaluated for transmission to the Commission. In the event that the safety tonnage credits are not approved by the Commission in respect of all the tonnage in question, the vessel owners will be obliged to meet the tonnage shortfall.</P>
    <P>Two of the vessels concerned are also showing a shortfall in engine power replacement capacity. My Department is in regular communication with the owners of the vessels concerned regarding this shortfall and has advised them that the excess power must be addressed without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is going on here? Five vessels have been issued with licences subject to a number of issues being resolved. Another vessel, the largest in the Irish fleet and one of the largest in the world, has already been discussed. Why does the Minister so often find himself in a position in which he issues licences to a small number of vessels in advance of various criteria and conditions being met, while at the same time refusing to issue licences to other bona fide persons, whose applications are in accordance with the licensing scheme and who have complied with all requirements on matters such as replacement tonnage and replacement power? Is there a reason extraordinary efforts are made for a small number of vessels, about which arguments are taking place with the European Commission, while for a substantial number of other vessels a rigid approach is taken, under which every &ldquo;I&rdquo; must be dotted and every &ldquo;T&rdquo; crossed before a licence is issued?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State inform the House if the enlargement of these five vessels is related solely to safety and stability? Has any of it been related to an upgrading of the fishing equipment and the storage equipment on vessels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has all been related to safety credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in constant contact with the European Commission and we intend to regularise the position with regard to the five boats. Two other vessels have been issued with licences on an excep<Col N="944" /> tional basis pending resolution of safety tonnage issues and my officials are following up on a third which has come to our attention in the past few weeks. That is in addition to the five vessels the Deputy mentioned in his question, but the circumstances are similar. It is not a question of just cutting this off at five vessels. The Deputy will understand that it is very important to us to have a safe fleet. Obviously the bigger the equipment, the safer that equipment will be. We have an ageing fleet and we want to bring it up to modern operational standards. It is our intention to ensure that the tonnage required is either found or credited for safety reasons. It is our intention that there is no skulduggery whatsoever. I stress that this is being done for safety reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there a particular problem with these five vessels and the other three the Minister of State mentioned? How long has this anomalous circumstance obtained? How many temporary licences have been granted to these vessels and how often have they been extended? Does the Minister of State agree that it is very, very odd &ndash; to say the least &ndash; that in relation to these five vessels and the three others this approach is being taken by his Department when a much simpler request regarding a much smaller vessel for the replacement of a timber vessel by a steel vessel was turned down even though all the tonnage requirements were met?

      <Quest>the discussions he has had with the owners of a company (details supplied) regarding their plans for the future of the mine and the ore base, having regard to their decision to lay off 700 workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of a recent meeting with the company's management team, I am satisfied that they have a real commitment to reopening Tara Mines once it is clear that zinc prices are moving to satisfactory levels. They have also indicated a commitment to continue <Col N="945" /> their minerals exploration programme in tandem with resumption of mining and to ensure the company's long-term involvement in exploration and mining in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The company has told me that its parent company's long-term intention is to reduce its stake in base metals mining throughout the world. This is intended to allow it to reinvest part of its capital in other areas of technology. However, it intends to maintain an active partnership with others in zinc mines that will ensure the long-term supply of zinc to its own smelters. To make any deal attractive to prospective partners it must have a working economic mine. If the company were to close Tara Mines it could not sell it economically and could not recover its investment. I was therefore assured that the company intends to further develop the mine by increasing its investment as soon as it is satisfied that zinc prices are moving sustainably in the right direction. This strategy will allow it to achieve its twin aims of continuity of supply and freeing up part of its investment.</P>
      <P>Zinc mining is a global industry with a single worldwide market. The average price of zinc during 2000 was over $1,100 per tonne. This year prices fell from $1,000 in May to approximately $750 in mid-November. At that price level, over half the zinc mines in the world cannot cover their costs of production, let alone service capital and shareholders' funds.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>.</P>
      <P>Tara Mines was obviously not immune from the impact of such price reductions. Not alone is it serious for the company, it is very hard on the workers who are to be laid off and I very much regret their situation. I am assured by Tara Mines that the layoffs are temporary. They are designed to preserve the company's ability to work the mine in the future and thereby ensure the long-term employment of the workers. As the Deputy is aware, employment policy is a matter for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. It would not in any event be appropriate to comment further on the situation when Labour Court hearings have been arranged for today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State agrees that the announcement by Outokumpo of its decision to lay off 700 workers at Tara Mines is a huge blow to those workers, to the local economy and, indeed, to the national economy. Can the he clarify two points? When he says that Outokumpo has informed him of its intention to reduce its stake in base metals mining, does that mean the company intends to sell Tara Mines? In relation to the company's commitment to reopen the mine once it is clear that zinc prices have been restored to a satisfactory level, has it been indicated to the Minister of State what exactly that meant? Does it refer to prices returning to the level they were at last May? Did the Minister establish when the company expects that to occur <Col N="946" /> and therefore how long the company expects Tara Mines to remain closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>From our discussions with the company we find it difficult to say when the mine will reopen. It is definitely the company's intention to reopen and the company is committed to remaining here. The mine is a good one and has great potential. I do not doubt that it will reopen; however that depends on an increase in the price of zinc. Even in the past week the price has gone from $750 to $760, which may be an indication of an upturn. At this stage there is no guarantee as the Deputy knows well.</P>
      <P>I cannot give a definitive date upon which the mine will reopen, but there is no doubt that it will. That is what the workers have been told time and again. The production and sale of zinc are cyclical. I understand what the Deputy says and the Government certainly does not relish the thought of another 700 workers being let go. It wishes that were not the case and all it can do is do all it can to ensure the mine reopens as soon as possible. The Deputy will agree that it has very little say in zinc prices going up.</P>

The planting targets set out in the 1996 strategic plan for forestry, Growing for the Future, envisaged annual planting of up to 25,000 hectares to 2000 and 20,000 hectares thereafter. While these ambitious targets have not been met in recent years, nonetheless the planting levels achieved have been significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a number of significant developments recently which will help to bring plant<Col N="947" /> ing in line with targets. First, the role of forestry as one of the motors of rural development has been recognised in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which is co-funded by the Exchequer and the European Commission. Significant funding of about £540 million &ndash; 686 million &ndash; has been provided for afforestation under the plan, with a further £100 million available for structural measures. A further £80 million is being invested by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Second, as the Deputy will recall, average increases of about 30% in the afforestation grant and premium levels were introduced for new planting last year. The current rate of premium is £308 per hectare for the standard 20% diverse conifer category in the case of farmers. Rates for broadleaf are as high as £373 per hectare. Premiums are payable to farmers over a 20 year period and are tax free.</P>
    <P>The positive aspects of these substantial increases was partly offset, however, by the refusal of the European Commission to agree to similar increases for those who planted before 2000. While the Commission's attitude was disappointing, the importance of the matter was recognised by the Irish Government. At the end of July, I secured Government agreement to fund the increases from the Exchequer and I am now awaiting a decision from the Commission under the State aids procedure. A positive response from the Commission, which I expect to receive shortly, will give a very positive boost to the afforestation programme. I have also secured agreement in principle on the inclusion, for the first time ever, of a mid-term review of premium rates under the rural development plan. That review will be in hand next year.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects to which I need to draw attention. The national climate change strategy recognises the beneficial aspects of forestry, particularly in countering greenhouse gases and in its role as a carbon sequestrator and the rural development plan provides for the integration of forestry and REPS. This will offer significant opportunities for forestry in the future. Given the combination of these factors, I am confident that planting levels will increase to target levels on an incremental basis over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister of State is missing the point. I understand only too well the aids and benefits that exist for farmers and others to commit land to forestry. The Minister of State believes that the level is only 15,000 hectares this year. It was well flagged for the past two or three years that a 30% increase was on the way. Will the Minister of State tell the House what plans he and the Department have to try to include more land in afforestation, given that everybody understands the rate of grant aid and so on and that there is no hope of the national target being met over the next five or six years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The partnerships between farmers and Coillte, <Col N="948" /> while useful, are not being opted for by many farmers. Will the Minister of State outline the current strategy in the Department to try to ensure that much more land will be committed to forestry? I refer to the type of land that is obviously of little use for anything else. There is much land of this kind available, but for whatever reason, farmers are not committing it to forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that farmers are very traditional and conservative. They find it difficult to move away from conventional farming. If farmers can secure more than £100 per acre, tax free and guaranteed for 20 years, I would like to hear about it, regardless of the type of land. We all know conventional farming is undergoing difficulties at present. Fifteen thousand hectares is approximately 40,000 acres of land. Much planting is required to meet this target. I hope that in the next few days we will get permission from Europe to increase the grant aid to those who planted prior to 1999. That, in itself, will be a big boost to farmers. When farmers begin to realise that the most recent increase of 30% has an in-built and added attraction in that it will be reviewed every three years, they will change their perspective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding has been provided in my Department's Vote since 2000 to encourage the development of pilot schemes at catchment level to incentivise the reduction of commercial salmon fishing. It is stated policy that the context for such schemes will be strictly catchment based, voluntary and locally driven and based on matching funding from all players at realistic levels. The regional fisheries boards have been asked to lead and encourage pilot schemes. Take-up has been disappointing, but this reflects the complexities and difficulties involved in brokering consensus at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000 one pilot scheme for voluntary set-aside of salmon fishing engines was agreed. The scheme involves the set-aside of draft nets and a fixed fishing engine on the Munster Blackwater. <Col N="950" /> The pilot scheme is intended to operate for a period of five years, that is, 2000 to 2004. The proposal has been developed in consultations involving my Department, the Blackwater Salmon Development Group, the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute. The Southern Regional Fisheries Board has taken account of the scheme on behalf of the Department.</P>
    <P>The scheme has three elements: no fish to be captured by five draft nets for the period 2000-04 &ndash; it is estimated that the value of the fish catch to be forgone by the owner of each of these nets is £3,166 per annum; no fish to be captured by the fixed engine net at Ballintrae for the period 2000-04 &ndash; it is estimated that the value of the fish catch to be forgone by the owner of this fixed engine net is £5,000 per annum; a maximum of 625 salmon to be taken by the Lismore Estate draft net over the period 2000-04 subject to a maximum of 200 fish in any one of these years &ndash; it is estimated that the value of the fish catch to be forgone by the owner of this net is £1,250 per annum.</P>
    <P>The total estimated value of fish not taken by the seven fishing engines is £22,080, 28,036, per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Under the pilot scheme compensation in this amount is to be paid to the owners of the nets with 50% being from private funds raised by the Blackwater Salmon Development Group and 50% from my Department. The matching Exchequer funding, therefore, is £11,040, 14,018, per annum for each of the years 2000-04.</P>
    <P>This pilot scheme does not encompass the drift net licence holders in the district. A separate proposal has been developed by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board working with the Blackwater Salmon Development Group. The Minister met the group recently to discuss its proposals and emphasised the need to ensure value for money in finalising the scheme. Discussions are continuing on these proposals. In addition, all the regional boards are being urged to proactively encourage the development of sustainable cost effective proposals at catchment level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned three estates where licences had been purchased for set-aside schemes, but he named only two &ndash; Lismore Castle and Ballintrae. What is the third? I got the distinct impression from the Minister the last day we had Question Time that money is the problem when it comes to the set-aside scheme and that he is not prepared to spend money to buy fishermen's licences. There is a mixture of fishermen. Some would like to avail of a set-aside scheme while others would like to keep the tradition going, as the Minister of State rightly said. A number of the licences are dormant and not being used. Where licences are being used, the Minister of State should promote a set-aside scheme in all fishery areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is somewhat similar to Deputy Deasy's. When will the Minister of State embark on this set aside-scheme for the entire coastline as far as salmon fishermen are concerned? There is a growing demand along the south western seaboard. Several traditional salmon fishermen have stated to me that they are still awaiting a firm commitment from the Minister of State and his Department as to what scheme he has in mind as far as set-aside is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>Following on from Deputy Sheehan's question, is the Minister of State aware that in the particular area to which Deputy Sheehan referred there has been a very substantial difference between the level of inducement offered in the first round of discussions and what seemed to be available when interest was expressed by fishermen who wished to involve themselves in the scheme? That has been a very serious disap<Col N="952" /> pointment to a number of those who wished to take advantage of the set-aside scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that there is no question of a blank cheque being issued. We are interested in progressing the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State should send the Taoiseach down to sign a few blank cheques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Gilmore's question, the scheme is not a failure. It is not going as well as we would like it to go, but at least it is progressing. Perhaps it will take until 2004 before we see the value of the scheme in operation. On what Deputies Deasy, Sheehan and Dukes said, if only some fishermen on the river are anxious to become involved, it will not be successful. It has to be all or nothing. If some decide to sell to us &ndash; if it is a buy-out &ndash; and not fish, then others on the river using any of the nets I mentioned will catch the fish the others would have caught. It has to be all or nothing. We are thinking in those terms.</P>
      <P>The fisheries boards are discussing the matter in various areas. That is probably the reason the Deputy was prompted to ask the question today, that is, because fishermen have said they want to sell. There are fishermen in my area who are very anxious to sell, lease or give it up, if paid per annum over a period. Slowly, people are beginning to accept this may happen. I should state two things &ndash; there is no blank cheque while tradition is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Three fish escapes have been reported to my Department by fish farms this year to date. The corresponding figure for 2000 was seven escapes, of which two incidents related to marine sites. I have arranged for a table to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aquaculture licences are subject to a variety of conditions designed to ensure best practice and the taking of all necessary precautionary-remedial action. It is a licence condition that fish escapes must be reported immediately to the Department and to the Regional Fisheries <Col N="953" /> Boards. The cause of the escape must also be established by the fish farm and necessary remedial action taken to address this. Stock losses must also be quantified. It is usually the case that the Regional Fisheries Board, in consultation with the Marine Institute, will take steps to recapture escaped stock.</P>
    <P>To ensure full confidence in the systems in place, I have requested my Department to undertake a comprehensive review of escape prevention strategies, reporting and alert systems and remedial strategies. Where overhaul is needed, action will be taken, as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>It is in the aquaculture industry's commercial interest to ensure that escapes are minimised to the greatest extent possible in line with the best international practice and standards. I am very satisfied that, with technical advancement and improved cage technology, incidents of fish escapes have reduced very significantly in recent years. However, there is no room for complacency and the enhancement of prevention and remedial strategies is a key priority of all concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister said there were five escapes from river fish farming operations in the year 2000. Can he tell the House if the recapture policy worked in those cases?

      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether any of the incidents in the years 2000 or 2001 would be regarded as a large-scale incident? Will he tell the House what reality exists in trying to ensure recapture of lost stock in light of a marine event?</P>

It is our understanding that a particular escape incident referred to here on previous occasions did not ever happened. It is in all our interests, particularly the farmer's, that there be no escape. Fish farms are similar to animal farms except one would have a better chance recapturing a beast than a fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been substantial improvement in the <Col N="954" /> manufacture of cages since the salmon industry took off. One of the escape incidents was caused by the malfunctioning of a hydraulic lift. The people involved lost a great deal of money. That will not go down too well with them or their bank managers. Another incident arose as a result of a seal attacking a cage. Fish farmers on the North American coast put a much stronger and bigger net on the outside of their cages to prevent seals from getting near them. I witnessed that when I visited North America.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned, I moved that this Bill be recommitted to Committee under Standing Order 120 because Report Stage contained new material which had not been discussed on Committee Stage. The Minister of State acknowledged, in two cases, that this is so. Also, it is now proposed that a section removed on Committee Stage be re-inserted into the Bill on Report Stage. We have tabled amendments to that proposal which are viewed in a different light in view of the fact that the Government has changed its mind on section 21.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with the onus of proof which is one of my main concerns regarding some of the Minister's later amendments. Under the Bill, the onus of proof is on the accused. This is a reversal of the normal course of justice in which a person is assumed innocent until proven guilty.</P>
      <P>I made these points on Committee Stage and do not have much to add. I would like to hear the Minister's views as to whether he has taken on board our points regarding the reversal of the onus of proof.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to remove from the Bill a presumption that a person who held property in trust for one or more persons had appropriated it for his or her own benefit or use in certain specific circumstances. Section 4(3) of the Bill is based on a recommendation by the Government's advisory committee on fraud which recommended the creation of what it described as a general deficiency offence, that is to make it an offence for a person who holds money in trust as agent for others not to maintain in the account sufficient funds at all times to pay in full what is due to each person.</P>
      <P>For example, at present where an auctioneer or solicitor holds money on behalf of several clients in a mixed account and then takes some of the money for personal use, it may be difficult to prove an offence as it may not be clear whose money has been taken. This is the case because enough money may remain to pay some clients, but the general deficiency becomes apparent only if all clients seek repayment at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4(3)(<i>c</i>) provides that where there is a deficiency and the person fails to provide a satis<Col N="960" /> factory explanation, it will be presumed that he or she appropriated, without the consent of the owner or owners, all, or part, of the deficiency. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that this presumption may be rebutted. The offence to which the presumption in section 4(3)(<i>c</i>) refers, requires an appropriation of property, a dishonest intent that the appropriation was without the owner's consent, and that there was an intent to deprive the owner.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 4(3)(<i>c</i>) is to provide that the person is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have appropriated the deficiency without consent in the circumstances provided for in the section. It does not presume any intention to deprive or any dishonest intent and will not be activated if there is a satisfactory explanation. Therefore, it is not presuming guilt.</P>
    <P>Where a person holds property in trust for one or more persons, it is not inconsistent with the presumption of innocence that the trustee, who has a duty to account for the property, and who alone is in a position to know exactly how a deficiency arose, should have to provide a satisfactory explanation of that deficiency when called upon to do so. Therefore, to delete section 4(3)(<i>c</i>) would be to leave the section without the necessary means to ensure trustees can be held responsible for the disappearance of property. I could go further on this issue, but I realise Deputy O'Sullivan wishes to move on to the amendments to which she has referred. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Account is not being taken of, for example, an error made in a bank. I made these points on Committee Stage, but it seems draconian to assume a person is guilty and that he or she has to prove his or her innocence. Errors can be made of which the person may not be aware. The individual may also not be in a position to prove that he or she was not responsible for the error. This provision is draconian to some extent and should not be included in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave an example regarding a solicitor's accounts and money held in trust. He is aware that solicitors hold a significant amount of money on behalf of clients. He knows that, while an account is in the name of the solicitor or the solicitor's firm, each individual has a personal account in his or her name. If there is a need to carry out an investigation, one can easily ascertain in which account the money is and in whose name it is held. One will be able to inquire as to the name and address of the person involved. A paper trail will exist which makes it easy to account for the money. There is some concern regarding this provision and I share some of Deputy O'Sullivan's concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The presumption is rebuttable. Many presumptions are made in law regarding various issues which are rebuttable, as is the case with this presumption if the individual <Col N="961" /> involved can come forward with a satisfactory explanation.</P>
      <P>I am not speaking about specific separate accounts, but about accounts held <i>en bloc</i> where there may be 100, 200, 300 or 400 clients, and all of the money is held in a client account regarding which there is a deficiency. In those circumstances it may not be possible to prove whose money has been interfered with. Therefore, it is fair and just that the presumption operates. Such a presumption is rebuttable. If the individual can do so, that is fine, if he or she cannot rebut the presumption, then that is a different matter.</P>
      <P>We have to be pragmatic. This is a means of getting at dishonesty and there is no simple solution. I wish there were, but the fact that the presumption is rebuttable answers any concerns which people may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this can be dealt with under the Finance Acts. If there is a problem, the Revenue Commissioners have powers under the Finance Acts. The Finance Act, 1994, gave the Minister for Finance powers to enter the office of a solicitor, an auctioneer or an accountant to obtain and retain books for examination to ascertain whether there is a problem. The provision in this Bill criminalises this matter, whereas, under the Finance Acts, the Revenue Commissioners have powers to enter such offices. The Statute Book includes broad powers to deal with problems which makes it unnecessary to proceed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take an example in which a solicitor holds £1 million in trust for 100 different clients, and £100,000, or less, goes missing. It may not be impossible to prove an offence in the sense that it would not be possible to prove whose money was taken. This is so because there would be sufficient money to pay most, but not all, of the clients.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances it is surely reasonable for people to accept that there has to be some form of a general deficiency offence to ensure all the funds are held intact for all of the clients &ndash; in other words, that there is a sufficient amount of money in the client account at all times to cover all clients, and that a person cannot abscond with one client's funds in the context in which it is impossible to prove a case against him or her on the basis that it is impossible to prove whose money was taken. The provision in the Bill is reasonable and sensible and this offence should be on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to press this amendment. We have an obligation to ensure, not only that people who are guilty are brought to justice, but also that innocent people are not wrongly accused or found guilty. Deputy Enright and I are indicating that there are circumstances in which a person might be considered guilty and be unable to prove otherwise. That is, in effect, what he or she is required to do under this section, rather than the State or someone else having to prove that he <Col N="962" /> or she is guilty. People will have to prove that they are not guilty. This is a fundamental reversal of the normal procedures and that is why I wish to press the amendment.</P>
      <P>Question, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 6 and 7, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;means&rdquo; in line 6 down to and including &ldquo;property&rdquo; in line 7 and substitute &ldquo;includes taking possession of such property, exercising dominion over such property, usurping or otherwise adversely interfering with the proprietary rights of the owners of such property&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment aims to provide a clearer definition of the term &ldquo;appropriates.&rdquo;  In addition, while our amendment does not address it, the Minister might enlighten us on the concept of someone borrowing an item. If someone borrows an item with the intention of returning it in the future, is it covered by this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would broaden the meaning given to the word &ldquo;appropriates&rdquo; in the Bill by adding further to the circumstances which amount to taking ownership. In seeking to do this it would have the effect of creating uncertainty about when an appropriation is to be regarded as amounting to an essential element of the offence of theft. The intention in the Bill is that an appropriation will only arise where there is an assumption by a person of the rights of the owner. When taken with the requirement for dishonesty in section 4 it corresponds to the idea of converting the property for one's own use or benefit. It has the advantage, therefore, of clarity and certainty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this section does not actually deal with the point, but if someone borrows an item with the intention of returning it, yet the owner does not know &ndash; say, someone goes into a farmyard and takes a hay turner or tractor and has it in their possession &ndash; is that person guilty of theft?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment fulfils a commitment I gave on Committee Stage in relation to section 6 of the <Col N="963" /> Bill. The side heading to section 6 states that it is concerned with making a gain or causing a loss by deception. Section 6, however, does not use the word &ldquo;deception.&rdquo;  Having examined the matter in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, I have decided to amend the section by adding the words &ldquo;by any deception.&rdquo;  Thus a person will be guilty of an offence if he or she dishonestly, by any deception, induces another person to do or not to do something with the intention of making a gain for himself or herself or a third party, or to cause a loss to that person.</P>

      <P>In page 16, to delete lines 28 and 29 and substitute the following:</P>

      <P>I am glad we have reached these amendments. It is particularly unfortunate that 50 minutes were wasted in speaking about whether we would actually get to these amendments.

      <P>These amendments reverse a series of amendments which I proposed on Committee Stage arising out of a Government decision to deal with the amendment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in the Illicit Traffic by Sea Bill, to which they were more relevant. However, the events of 11 September in the United States of America resulted in greater urgency being given to the fight against terrorism and associated money laundering. In order to be able to respond to this worldwide effort to defeat terrorism, it was decided that these changes to the 1994 Act should be reinserted in the Bill, as the Illicit Traffic by Sea Bill is unlikely to be enacted before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 is the principal amendment among this group of amendments. Its purpose is to substitute a new section for section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, setting out a revised <Col N="964" /> offence of money laundering. The main difference between the new section 31 and the current section 31 is the introduction of the concept of recklessness in the offence. The new section is long, but I will endeavour to set out the main elements.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) contains the elements of the offence of money laundering. It provides that a person will be guilty of money laundering in certain circumstances. These are that the person knows or believes, or is reckless about whether property is or represents criminal proceeds, and the person, without lawful authority or excuse, then acts in relation to the property by, for example, converting, transferring or handling it intending to conceal or disguise its true nature, source or ownership or helping another person to avoid prosecution or to avoid the making of a confiscation order, concealing or disguising its true nature, source or ownership, or acquiring, possessing or using the property.</P>
    <P>Where a person does any of these things in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that he or she knew or believed, or was reckless about whether, the property was criminal proceeds, he or she will be taken to have known or believed, or been reckless, unless the court or the jury is satisfied otherwise.</P>
    <P>A person will be considered to be reckless for this purpose if he or she disregarded a substantial risk that the property was the proceeds of criminal conduct. A substantial risk in this context means a risk of such a nature and degree that, having regard to the circumstances, its disregard involves culpability of a high degree.</P>
    <P>The section also sets out what is meant by converting, transferring or handling property, what is covered by the reference to believing that property is or represents criminal proceeds and what such proceeds are deemed to constitute as well as what is meant by handling such property. There is provision for the admissibility of documentary evidence.</P>
    <P>The penalty for an offence under this section will be a fine of £1,500 and up to 12 months imprisonment, or both, following summary conviction, or an unlimited fine, or up to 14 years imprisonment, or both, following conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 18 are consequential on amendment No. 3 and merely include reference to the new section 31 in sections 16 and 37 of the Bill which refer to money laundering.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 provides, in effect, that reference to an offence in Parts 4 or 7 of the 1994 Act, dealing with money laundering and international co-operation respectively, will be construed as reference to a revenue offence, that is, an offence in connection with taxes, duties or exchange control.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity to look at these amendments. On Committee Stage we tabled an amendment to section 21, the object of this group of amend<Col N="965" /> ments. However, the Minister withdrew the entire section on Committee Stage and, therefore, our amendment was not relevant. It has now been retabled on Report Stage. The main objection I have to this procedure is the fact that we are being asked to deal with issues that are either totally new, or about which we had no indication that they would be reintroduced on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The main concern we had about section 21 was the issue of reversing the onus of proof which, incidentally, relates to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, not this Bill. The section states, &ldquo;the proof of which shall lie on him or her.&rdquo;  This relates specifically to being guilty of money laundering or being reckless as to whether the property concerned represents the proceeds of criminal conduct. First, we are placing the onus of proof on the person being accused, rather than whoever is accusing them and, second, they must prove that they were not reckless. One could understand that if somebody was caught money laundering, the onus of proof might have to be placed on them, but not if someone is reckless as to whether the material they are handling represents the proceeds of crime.</P>
      <P>There is a very good market in Limerick on Saturday mornings, but if it turns out that what I have purchased there was related to the proceeds of criminal conduct, am I being reckless? Do I have to prove that I was not being reckless in buying this item from a stall-holder? The people concerned have a licence for their stalls, but the person who issues the licence does not go into the detail of where the stall-holders obtained the property they are selling. They are selling various items in different places around the country. I am concerned that we will criminalise those who may be totally innocent.</P>
      <P>If I, as a member of the public, purchase an item at a market stall, and it turns out afterwards that the person who sold it to me had committed a crime because the item had been acquired illegally, have I been reckless and do I have to prove that I have not been? This is a serious matter which the Minister is proposing to insert in the Bill. I am particularly concerned by the method being used to deal with this matter. We are amending an Act through this Bill. We are reversing what the Government intended to do on Committee Stage, which was to remove the section, yet it is now being reinserted in the legislation. The whole procedure is unsatisfactory. I am particularly concerned about reversing the onus of proof as regards, not somebody who committed a crime, but someone who handled the goods, perhaps unknowingly. It is being suggested now that such a person may be considered reckless in handling such material. It is important to consider what might be the result for innocent individuals of including this in the legislation.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a solicitor of long standing and he is heading into his fifth year as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The one basic thing anyone learns in law school <Col N="966" /> is the presumption of innocence. This goes back to the time when British laws were imposed in Britain and in Ireland. We are now removing that presumption of innocence. Amendment No. 11 states that the &ldquo;proof of which shall lie on him or her&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest atrocities and tragedies in my lifetime happened on 11 September. We were all saddened, worried, upset and traumatised by those events. A small group or cell of people planned that attack on America. However, what happened on 11 September is separate from what we are doing here. I agree with the Minister that we should do all we can to stamp out money laundering and the practice of people using the proceeds of crime. We should make every effort to introduce laws for people involved in money laundering, who use the proceeds of criminal conduct or who are reckless as to whether it is or represents such proceeds. The person must prove his innocence. Amendment No. 11 states: </P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or to both.</P>
      <P>The Minister is the Minister in a country where we have always sought to protect innocent people, the downtrodden and those in difficulty. The danger with this and other legislation which is being introduced in the United Kingdom and across Europe and the western world is that many innocent people will be imprisoned. Serious wrongs are committed, but there is a danger that other wrongs will be committed if we pass such legislation. If the Minister was in Opposition and this legislation was introduced by us if we were on that side of the House, the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would have difficulty controlling him because of his indignation at the fact that such a major mistake was being made. The Minister should consider what he is doing. Innocent people will be put in a position where they will not be able to prove their innocence. The Minister would not like to see anyone wrongly convicted. By removing the presumption of innocence and putting the onus of proof on the person, the Minister is in danger of making a mistake. I ask him to consider his position on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the position that legislation brought before the House, unless it is entering new territory, nearly always amends previous legislation. I say that to address Deputy O'Sullivan's point about this legislation amending other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the possibility of a person going to the Limerick mart and purchasing goods and being obliged subsequently to establish that he or she was not reckless in doing so. She asked whether in such circumstances <Col N="967" /> where she handles goods which are laundered she would be held to be guilty under the section. The answer is that she would not nor is it conceivable that she would be charged. The reason is that the word reckless is defined in the interpretation section, section 16, for this purpose. It states: </P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Part, a person is reckless if he or she disregards a substantial risk that the property handled is stolen, and for those purposes &ldquo;substantial risk&rdquo; means a risk of such a nature and degree that, having regard to the circumstances in which the person acquired the property and the extent of the information then available to him or her, its disregard involves culpability of a high degree.</P>
    <P>A person buying goods at the mart in Limerick, as Deputy O'Sullivan described it, would not be caught under this section. The reason is that the degree of recklessness of a high degree, the degree of culpability of a high degree, would not exist.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the burden of proof, I am relatively used to being second guessed in the House about what I might or might not say in Opposition. When I introduced the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, from the Opposition benches, which deals with the freezing of assets today by the Criminal Assets Bureau, I reversed the burden of proof. I stated that it was incumbent upon the person against whom the order was sought to establish that the goods were not illicit. That was a reversal of the burden of proof and a welcome and appropriate one in a civil order setting. This is a criminal sanction or at least it proposes or presumes there will be a criminal sanction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is one thing to know or to believe something, but it is another thing being reckless as to whether it is or represents such proceeds. It is difficult to prove someone has not been reckless in terms of acquiring something innocently from someone else. I am concerned about the burden of proof in combination with the recklessness. One must prove one is innocent. If the person from whom I bought an item has a record of money laundering and it is subsequently proven that he or she is involved in money laundering, that person should be prosecuted and the force of the law should be brought against him or her. However, I may not have any way of proving how I acquired the property from that person. I will not get a receipt in those circumstances. It is fundamentally wrong that the onus of proof should be on me to prove I am innocent. It would be difficult in such circumstances because I would have acquired the property at the next remove. It is one thing if I know or believe it to be the proceeds of criminal conduct, but being reckless as to whether it is or represents such proceeds is <Col N="968" /> another step. The onus of proof should not be on the individual.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Limerick market is similar to many other markets. Many have to exercise a certain modicum of care. People exercise that modicum of care in regard to purchases at marts because problems can arise with property purchased. My main problem concerns the burden of proof. In regard to the proceeds of crime, the Criminal Assets Bureau has been successful in moving where there is money laundering and property has been acquired as the proceeds of crime. I am concerned about a person who may not be in a position to prove his or her innocence and is liable for a prison term of up to 14 years or a fine. That is a particularly penal law about which I have grave reservations. Most of those who will study this debate and law will also have grave reservations about it. While this provision will be pushed through, it is unwise. In the long-term, because of laws of this nature, we are heading into a situation where it is more likely that innocent people will be condemned, convicted and sentenced to prison in the wrong. That is something of which nobody wishes to be a part. There is an old tenet that suggests it is better to have a guilty person walk free than an innocent man sentenced to prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I did not have the opportunity to finish what I was about to say on the burden of proof because of time constraints in my earlier contribution. Under this legislation there is no obligation on an accused person to prove that he or she was not reckless. The burden of proof, in so far as the ingredient of recklessness is concerned, does not extend to the accused. However, where the accused person states that he or she holds the property with lawful authority or excuse, it is perfectly reasonable to ask him or her to establish to the satisfaction of the court that this is the case. There is no question of the person being asked to establish, as a matter of proving beyond a reasonable doubt, that the position is that he or she was not reckless. All we are saying is that the accused person, if he or she pleads lawful authority or excuse, should establish this. That is reasonable and perfectly fair.</P>
      <P>In regard to the degree of recklessness, &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; is a word commonly used and commonly known, there would have to be a high degree of culpability. If a lady goes down to the market in Limerick and purchases a television for £100, one might say there was not a high degree of culpability even though the television was probably worth £200. On the other hand, if a person goes down to the market in Limerick and buys a perfectly new television worth £200 for £1, the argument might be successfully raised in court that this was reckless and that there was a high degree of culpability, in other words, that the person should or could have known, if he or she was not reckless, as to whether he or she knew or not.</P>

        <b>: </b>I wish to share my time with Deputy John Brady.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before the House and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward as a matter of urgency. There has been much talk about this legislation for some time, and the Minister is to be complimented on giving priority to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's apology in 1999 was very welcome. It was a definitive public statement that the people who suffered at the hands of those in institutions in the past should have restitution and redress. The Minister said in his contribution that the Bill was about facing up to the mistakes made in the past and providing some reasonable measure of financial recompense to people who were wronged as children. It is very much a Bill about the present also because we are talking about people who are now aged but who have suffered gravely. For many years, these people felt the Government, political parties or politicians would recognise the grave injustices carried out against them over the years. We should all be grateful, therefore, that we now have an opportunity to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>I have been very involved with the organisation, Right of Place, Second Chance, in Enniscorthy town. The organisation originated in Cork, but it has now spread to other towns and counties. I have been involved with a significant number of people from the south-east over the past two years, culminating in the opening of an office in Enniscorthy early this year. Deputy Howlin was also very much involved in that, and we both attended the opening of that office. Great credit is due to the people in that organisation for the time, effort and courage involved in coming forward and making a case to the national politicians and for making a definitive statement in Enniscorthy, Wexford, and in the south-east area to the effect that they are putting in place an office to which people who were abused over the years can come and discuss their problems and plan for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Right of Place, Second Chance, significant funds have been allocated to the Cork organisation, which I favour, but organisations that have now set up in Enniscorthy, and other parts of the country, are not getting the same amount of funding or recognition. In fairness to those involved in Enniscorthy, led by John Barrett, they went out and probably begged for office space. That was then funded by the health board, <Col N="973" /> and they were also helped by the VEC, the county enterprise boards, some politicians, the community and Bishop Comiskey to establish this office. A significant amount of money should be allocated to them on a yearly basis to ensure the office will continue to survive in the future and be able to pay for telephone, administration and staffing costs, and perhaps pay for people to come to the office from the south-east region.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest, many of the people we are talking about are in their late sixties, seventies or eighties and are not in a financial position to pay fares to travel long distances. Some of them have travelled from England and further afield, having emigrated in the 1960s to survive and find work. It is very important that adequate funding is made available to ensure Right of Place, Second Chance is viable and can continue to deal with education, retraining, general information services, repatriation, support, social activities and rights and entitlements.</P>
    <P>Many of the people to whom I have spoken have said the office has given them a new lease of life. I am sure the same applies to other offices. They can interact with people and access information and find out what is happening, for example, what the Minister and his Department or Right of Place, Second Chance are doing. Perhaps the Minister could encourage adult education institutions such as vocational education committees and similar organisations to give a helping hand.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very positive and forward looking and will be of major benefit. Ordinary schools, which have not been included in the Bill, have been mentioned several times. They may have to be dealt with in future. Could the Minister clarify whether other groups, namely, people with disabilities who were placed in orthopaedic hospitals and children who were placed in foster care, will be included in the Bill? Some of these people also suffered greatly. How does the Minister envisage these groups will be dealt with in future?</P>
    <P>Many people to whom I have spoken in my area want the Bill to be given the utmost urgency. However, we have received documents from several organisations including, Survivors of Child Abuse and Never Free, Forever Tortured, in which they expressed serious concerns about certain aspects of the Bill and called for its passage to be postponed. It is important the Minister clarifies their concerns.</P>
    <P>I was contacted over the weekend by a number of people who were abused regarding an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> entitled, Order Say We Can't Pay £100 million to Abuse Fund. The matter needs to be clarified. The article states, &ldquo;Nearly one year into the negotiations on the scheme the religious orders have still to make a firm offer on an amount that they are willing to contribute.&rdquo;  This appears to be delaying tactics on the part of orders which were involved in serious abuse. We all know the religious orders have a great deal of valuable land and property. They would not have great difficulty raising £100 <Col N="974" /> million, or whatever figure is agreed, for the fund. The people expecting a contribution at the end of this process are concerned by this kind of negative publicity.</P>
    <P>CORI regularly lectures politicians about their uncaring and unconcerned attitude to the poor. This debate is about people who have suffered greatly at the hands of the religious orders. It is very important that they are asked to make a definitive offer as quickly as possible instead of approaching newspapers and making statements on negotiations they are holding with the Minister. Will the Minister inform the House when he expects the discussions with the religious orders to conclude and when he envisages they will make a definitive offer?</P>
    <P>Before handing over to Deputy Brady, I ask the Minister to ensure funding is made available to organisations operating under the banner of Right of Place, Second Chance regardless of where they may want to set up. It is very important that there are county offices or at least regional offices because not everybody can travel to Dublin or Cork to get the advice and support the organisation offers.</P>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has been very helpful in my negotiations with it. It is important the counselling service offered by the health boards continues and adequate funding is provided to guarantee the availability into the foreseeable future of the counselling and other services required for victims of abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his officials for introducing the Bill and making a genuine attempt to address what is a very complex, emotional and disturbing issue in Irish life and society. Through the provisions of this Bill, we are attempting in a formal way to confront the dark side of ourselves as individuals and as a society.</P>
      <P>The stated purpose of the Bill is to establish structures for making financial rewards to people who suffered injuries as a result of abuse while resident in institutions in the State. I will touch on a number of aspects of the Bill, namely, the proposed compensation mechanism, people's constitutional rights and its scope in terms of the categories comprehended by its provisions.</P>
      <P>Whatever provisions ultimately reach the Statute Book, I stress the need for a comprehensive public information campaign not only at home, but in the UK, USA and Canada. It should involve emigrants and related voluntary organisations in those countries. Many of the victims this Bill intended to help left the country because they could not bear to stay. They felt rejected in every sense by the society which had given birth to them. They are no less deserving of redress because they choose to make their lives elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important we all view the Bill in its proper historical context. The process commenced with the welcome and very necessary apology for the abuse and injury suffered by inmates of residen<Col N="975" /> tial institutions during the middle part of the last century made on behalf of the State by the Taoiseach in May 1999. It is estimated that about 30,000 people born since 1930 were committed to industrial schools and reformatories until such institutions were abolished in the 1970s. Based on pending court cases and other factual evidence, up to 10% of this very large group may have suffered abuse leading to physical injury.</P>
    <P>It is not before time for the State and society to formally and publicly recognise the wrongs done to innocent children all those years ago. Many of them are now elderly people in their sixties and seventies. There should be timely action, by way of public recompense for abuse suffered, before it is too late for many of them. The Bill sets out to provide mechanisms for as yet unspecified levels of compensation. This remedy can be only partial. At this late stage we cannot remove the blight put on innocent lives, lives which in many cases are reaching the end of their natural days. We recognise that we are contemplating an appropriate gesture of redress and that lives that have been lived and those who have lived them cannot be made fully new and fully whole.</P>
    <P>The 1930s through to the 1960s were different times with different standards and values from those we deem acceptable and appropriate today. Society has greatly changed over the period of time that has elapsed since and we must be careful in judging past behaviour by the values of today. This is not a simple issue, it is a complex one, but the one constant is the great wrong done to individuals and the evil shadow cast on innocent lives during the decades. The times of which we are speaking were very difficult and much harder for the generality of people. There was mass emigration until the early 1960s and little wealth or prosperity for ordinary folk. A subsistence existence bred harsh values, the extent of which makes for harrowing reading in the Garda crime statistics and prison reports of the time. The crimes referred to were committed mainly by unmarried women who became social outcasts when they had a child out of wedlock.</P>
    <P>Institutions such as those we are now considering, as well as orphanages, mental hospitals and county homes, were used to conceal society's problems from itself. That was tolerated for a variety of reasons. Society placed great store in, looked up to and heeded authority figures. It was only with the introduction of mass second and third level education, improved domestic and international communications and a measure of prosperity and individual self-confidence that a more questioning public emerged and things began to change. It is only through such developments, which in our case are quite recent, that we are able to confront the truly evil deeds and practices which remained buried for so long.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the issue of compensation for the abused we need to maintain a balanced perspective on the role of the Church and religious <Col N="976" /> orders in Irish life. The wrongs that have undoubtedly been done in institutions which were for the most part run by the religious orders must be seen in the context of the great contribution those orders have made to the formation of contemporary Ireland through the provision of education and health and social services. This contribution cannot be denied and can only be diminished or tarnished in some respects by the activities of a minority. In a different world of different values and limited opportunities many were literally forced into life-long careers they would not voluntarily have chosen for themselves.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern that matters not be unduly delayed in providing compensation for the victims and that there is pressure from a number of quarters to do so as quickly as possible. I cannot support those calling for action on this front and who now seek to slow down or delay indefinitely the passage of the Bill in order that the necessary preliminary research to enable a detailed scheme to be constructed and incorporated in the Bill to enable it to be debated in the House can be completed. However, I ask the Minister to examine carefully such a mechanism to provide the House with a full and proper opportunity to debate the merits of the compensation scheme. It is appropriate to give Members some assurance on this matter on the close of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The second matter on which I wish to comment is the protection of the rights of the individual under the Constitution. Every citizen accused of wrongdoing is entitled to vindicate his or her good name, to due process and natural justice. There is a fear abroad, particularly on the part of the members of religious orders and others who investigate and evaluate the process, that proposals contained in this Bill will not adequately provide sufficient safeguards in this respect. It is of particular concern with investigations which require a lesser or softer burden of proof than is required in a court of law to demonstrate abuse constituting wrongdoing by a person or persons against another on foot of which compensation is to be paid. Individuals can be named as part of proceedings and subsequently identified without an opportunity to know what precisely is alleged against them or without being given a full and proper opportunity to defend themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach had no option, but to apologise on behalf of the State after the revelations of abuse that poured into every household via a series of television programmes. The Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, is an attempt to deal in some small way with this whole sorry saga which constitutes one of the most appalling and black chapters in the history of this society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not the one that it could have been. I assume that everybody comes into the House with the intention of playing their part in building a fairer and better Ireland and providing an <Col N="977" /> opportunity for every citizen to live his or her life in the best way possible, to achieve his or her objectives and to use his or her talents. Looking back in ten years time it will be perfectly obvious that there are glaring issues which are not addressed in what the Minister has brought before us. No person in the House can, to my knowledge, speak with authority on this subject, unlike those who have been victims in the residential institutions and other locations over a great number of years. I salute the victims' real courage in being able to express, not only their feelings, but the facts as they were and are all these years later.</P>
    <P>When one sits down and talks to one of these now grown men and he lets one inside his mind, the savagery and the appalling abuse, by what was admittedly a minority, that one discovers shames us all in the House and all who went before us who were not able to deal with it. Perhaps they did not know, but we do. The courage of the victims in talking about these issues should be responded to through flexibility on our part in the Oireachtas to do what we can as legislators. The redressing of these wrongs and an attempt to compensate should be as open and full as possible.</P>
    <P>Every person has to live inside his or her own head. No amount of money can compensate for what any one of the people concerned has had to live with every day since these appalling incidents occurred. It is only when they explain these feelings in their own inimitable way that one can understand the real depth of frustration and hurt and the necessity for a response.</P>
    <P>I listened to a woman speaking on the Joe Duffy programme quite recently. She was the eldest of nine children. After a family break-up, she was left responsible for eight younger than herself. These children were taken away by force and put in care. The society that allowed such things to happen and allowed children to be taken away at the age of two years to be institutionalised was horrific. When I look at my own children I imagine what it must have been like for any young child to be faced with the forbidding grey walls of an institution in which fear, hurt, discrimination, savagery and sexual abuse occurred.</P>
    <P>One cannot tar everybody with the same brush. I was educated in Castlebar by the De La Salle brothers as a day pupil. To my knowledge, no brother in that monastery or school was sexually abusive to any boy. It was a difficult educational regime, but one that was an accepted part of Irish life at that time.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I listened to one of the groups giving evidence before the Joint Committee on Education and Science talking about Operation Shamrock. The Minister should allude to this in his response. Operation Shamrock involved bringing 500 German children to Ireland after the Second World War, but they were not institutionalised in the sense that the State would have known they were here. Perhaps the Minister will <Col N="978" /> outline the conditions, agreements and criteria that were obviously drawn up between the Irish Government and whatever German government or agency was involved. Has there been any follow through to account for any of these survivors?</P>
    <P>Many of the organisations now dealing with victims of residential abuse in all its forms have been formed from a conviction that something should be done for survivors. I know the Bill addresses this in part. I do not agree that this Bill should be delayed unduly, because the value of a legislature is that one can amend a Bill at any time one wishes &ndash; ignoring what is happening in respect of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill. If the Bill is not right, the Dáil and Seanad can change it and make additions. In addition, there is the availability of ministerial orders and directives. Therefore, the Bill should proceed, but should be more open in its approach to what it is trying to address.</P>
    <P>Many of the organisations dealing with the victims of residential abuse are very genuine in their concern about the availability of housing and the capacity of the State to give people a house who were either run out of the country, who fled because of the shame they thought was visited upon them or for other reasons. Local authorities do not accord any priority &ndash; if they reflect at all on the matter &ndash; to people who live abroad in terms of the allocation of housing in our local authority areas. Following the Taoiseach's apology on the State's behalf, if the State accepts that it owes these people something, then surely a roof over one's head is not too much to ask for.</P>
    <P>This Administration has not had the competence to deal with people on housing lists who have been victims of any residential abuse. I would like to see the Minister, Deputy Woods, responding to this debate by saying that the organisations that have grown from a sense of conviction and belief and which are helping victims of residential abuse should be listed. There should be criteria drawn up by the Minister to say that organisations will qualify for State assistance in respect of work they are doing, provided they meet certain criteria. That should not be too hard to draw up because there are not too many of them involved.</P>
    <P>Having spoken to victims abroad who were detained in residential institutions in this State, one can understand that the emigrants wish to be home &ndash; emigrants who had shame poured upon them and who had to leave the country not just for economic reasons but for a host of others.</P>
    <P>The issue of victims of abuse who attended day institutions must be addressed. Such victims should be considered also because abuse is wrong regardless of where and when it occurs. There is a difference in victims in the sense that those who were locked into residential institutions had not the freedom to leave while those who were being abused in day institutions &ndash; to whatever extent &ndash; at least had the opportunity to go home, what<Col N="979" /> ever kind of home that might be. Abuse is a common denominator and should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I came across a case some years ago of a woman who gave birth to a child out of wedlock. She suffered to a degree from post-natal depression and was incarcerated in a mental hospital for more than 50 years. That is a shame on the Irish nation as well. We have grown up in many respects. The drafting of the Bill should be broad enough to cater for all the categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Societies, the secretary of which is counsellor Sally Mulready in Camden Square, London, made a very strong plea for the inclusion of victims who worked in the Magdalen laundries. In her letter in October, she outlined the three categories of victims involved. First, there were those who were placed in Magdalen laundries as transferees from other institutions, reformatories, industrial schools or orphanages. Second, there were girls and women who were transferred between the ages of 16 and 18. They had been discharged from the first institution into society for employment and were then forcibly picked up in many cases and brought back to laundries, often under police escort and accompanied by nuns. Their legal status was never explained to them. The third category comprised those who worked in laundries over the age of 18, some of whom remained in them until the day they died. Although they may have had the legal right to leave those laundries, they were not aware of it. These three categories of women should also be included under the aegis of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should list the organisations dealing with the victims out of a sense of conviction and benevolence. He should set out the criteria under which they can qualify for State assistance to help these victims. He should enter into discussions with housing authorities in respect of the numbers involved to make some facility available for the rehousing or repatriation of those who may have lived for 50 years under this burden and crucifixion which they have had imposed on them by this country. The public information campaign should be as extensive as possible.</P>
    <P>As I said, one cannot tar everyone with the same brush. The point made by the bishops in respect of the acceptance of hearsay evidence is one which should be seriously looked at. We live in a litigious society. This is a small country where rumours abound and these types of libellous and slanderous remarks come very quickly to people. For other reasons completely malicious remarks or allegations might be made against people who worked, perfectly legitimately from their perspective, in an educational or residential institution. I would like the Bill to deal with this in a way in which there is an ability to respond and defend where a malicious allegation is made in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is getting close to the point at which the <Col N="980" /> Government should state what ball park figure it will put up. What moneys will the Government put up? What other facilities will it provide for further education and counselling and further draw out and draw forward those who have had to live with this for so many years? I share the point made by other Deputies that CORI should also be able to state approximately what it will be able to put up in terms of this fund. Not every priest, brother or sister was sexually abusive. They were not all that way, but it is very easy to brand the categories as such. The public information campaign should not only be directed at the victims or their families where they have died since the Taoiseach's apology, their spouses, children and so on, but should also attempt, in so far as it can, to direct itself at the numbers involved. I would like to hear the Minister's response as to what the Government and the bishops propose.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the four conditions for an application for assistance from the board. It reads:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) proof of his or her identity </P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) that he or she was resident in an institution during his or her childhood,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) that he or she was abused while so resident, and </P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) that he or she was injured as a consequence of abuse.</P>
    <P>One of the persons giving evidence at the committee yesterday read out a detention order, not a residency order, and twice referred to the fact that the said person was to be detained on the order of the Minister. The person concerned could prove not only that they were a resident, but that they were detained by ministerial order in an institution.</P>
    <P>The fourth condition is &ldquo;that he or she was injured as a consequence of such abuse.&rdquo;  One should look at the fear, confusion and terror on the faces of the children in the Ardoyne as they walk a gauntlet of steel to school. Imagine what it must have been like in the darkness of the corridors and dormitories and on the stone steps of grey residential institutions where those who were abusive felt they had a God given right to carry on the way they did. It may well be that in the early stages of abuse some of the victims did not suffer physical injury, but they have to live with it in their minds and no money or compensation can pay for this.</P>
    <P>That is the reason the Bill should be broad enough and the State big hearted and big minded enough to state it understands that of the 30,000 incarcerated in residential institutions or wherever from the 1930s to the 1970s, it can determine how many need particular counselling, attention and some State response in terms of the shame it imposed on them. In his response to the debate the Minister should look again at the Bill which needs to be amended. It is possible for the Minister to do this. In the broadest way possible we should do everything we can, as a Legislature, to <Col N="981" /> redress the wrong inflicted on these courageous people, many of whom are now willing and able to tell their story.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute, however briefly, to this important legislation. I welcome that at least some form of progress has been made following the initiative by the Minister which was promoted by his discussions with many of the interested parties. I do not wish to be repetitive or dwell on any points of importance that have already been made by my party spokesperson, Deputy Creed, or other Members. I would like, however, to highlight a fairly fundamental flaw in the legislation which emanates from the Title and continues to the last section, that is, the concentration by the Minister on the residential aspect. That the Bill refuses and neglects to countenance any form of compensation for the victims of sexual abuse at the hands of persons in schools, places of education or health care other than for those in residential institutions is a fundamental mistake. I call on the Minister to redress the imbalance.</P>
      <P>There are many victims who were day pupils and are anxious to participate in a properly structured compensation tribunal, authority or board, but cannot do so because they have been automatically excluded by the Minister in a most unfair way. I do not believe he has brought forward a coherent, logical or moral argument as to the reason a huge section of the community can, with the stroke of a pen be omitted. He should not be allowed to have his responsibilities side-tracked by ignoring persons whom he acknowledges suffered at the hands of State employees. The exclusion of persons abused at the hands of teachers in day schools is something on which the Minister has been far from convincing in his argument.</P>
      <P>For many decades the State has, by dint of its own legislation, ensured a compulsory aspect to schooling. It gave rise to a situation where pupils attending day schools had no choice but to attend &ndash; it is the law of the land to attend primary school. The State runs primary education in this jurisdiction. They are involved in the appointment of teachers, the structuring of the curriculum and the day-to-day management of schools. If the State is involved on a fundamental basis it then has a duty of care to ensure the protection of those attending the institution or school at all times. That duty of care extends to ensuring that State employees do not engage in the type of reprehensible criminal activity about which we have seen reports in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is on record as having said one of the reasons he is not prepared to extend the compensation scheme to persons in day schools is that such action would open the flood-gates. I challenge him to repeat that assertion at the close of this debate. If the Minister does so, he shows himself up as not having any defence. To say this issue is too hot to handle or that there is too much involved or that it is too big an issue has no basis <Col N="982" /> in law or morality. Until such time as this Bill ensures a form of redress for persons in day schools it is flawed legislation.</P>
    <P>Abuse takes many forms. I am sure everyone will agree that sexual abuse is particularly reprehensible. It is an offence to which the State should exhibit an attitude of zero tolerance. We must send out a very strong message that people employed by the State who engage in this type of behaviour will have no hiding place and will have the full rigors of the law imposed upon them. Similarly, there is a corresponding duty of care to ensure that where damage is inflicted, the victims are properly counselled and have an opportunity of redress. Whatever form that redress might take, among the options should be one of compensation. This is particularly important in instances where criminal offences have been perpetrated.</P>
    <P>It can be assumed, where abusers, teachers or otherwise, employed by the State, paid from the public purse and placed in positions of trust and confidence perpetrate criminal acts, that the State has failed to ensure the safety of the children. The State has a clear duty of care in our schools and educational establishments to ensure the safety of those obliged to attend by reason of our laws.</P>
    <P>The Government, and the Minister when introducing this Bill, accepted the principle of compensation. The principle of compensation is contained in the legislation. How can the Minister stand here and actively discriminate against day pupils accepting as he does the fact that they have been abused and accepting as he does that the activities and crimes perpetrated upon victims were such that in some case they gave rise to court proceedings. In some cases teachers have been charged, tried, convicted and jailed yet the victims do not appear to have any form of redress. That is most unfair.</P>
    <P>I will give a brief example of a situation that arose in a primary school in my constituency relating to a teacher who taught in Dublin and Longford in the 1950s and 1960s. There is a catalogue of abuse against him. He went on to teach in a school in County Offaly in the 1970s. Again, cases of abuse were spoken of in the area at the time. A letter was sent to the Department and the Bishop of the diocese of Kildare and Leighlin in 1982 to which there was no response. Some 17 years later, when the matter was raised in this House, it was acknowledged by the then Minister for Education that no action had been taken regarding the complaint. No acknowledgement had been sent to the victim; no reply had issued to the complainant. In the meantime, the teacher was transferred from County Offaly to another school in County Kilkenny, a position procured, presumably, by dint of an appointment ratified by the Department of Education. How could this have happened? What systems have been put in place to ensure this does not happen again? </P>
    <P>I would like to know what references were given that allowed this abuser proceed with his catalogue of abuse from County Offaly to County <Col N="983" /> Kilkenny and why nobody shouted &lsquo;stop'? It is worse than that. People obviously approved of the appointment; people provided references. If the Minister is serious about our recognising the ills of the past he should make available the files and papers in this case so we can see who provided the references for this abuser to proceed from one county to another. That teacher, when he left County Kilkenny in the 1980s took up a position in a secondary school in County Offaly where formal complaints of abuse were laid against him just before his retirement. I doubt this is the only case of that nature in the country. It is despicable that this could have happened the way it did. Clearly, this man had friends in high places who allowed him to proceed without any action on behalf of the Department or the church authorities until after his retirement when at last the Garda took action on foot of formal complaints. He is now serving a prison sentence, albeit short. It is particularly regrettable that this man's victims, like hundreds of others throughout the country, have no form of redress or compensation under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The voluntary bodies set up to co-ordinate the campaign on behalf of the victims have, in recent times, made cogent argument in favour of not proceeding with this legislation to final stages until such time as we know more about the level and type of compensation involved. How much money is involved? A figure somewhere between £200 million and £400 million was mentioned but there are very broad parameters. What money will be provided and how will compensation be measured? I understand there may be more than 6,000 victims who suffered abuse over a long period, perhaps 50 years. If we pass this legislation without having reached a deal with the religious bodies can we compute the State's liability? It is important that we pursue these issues on the floor of the House. How will compensation be measured? What are the various headings under which that compensation might come? Will damages be awarded under headings other than pain and suffering? I assume the bulk of damages claims will be made under the heading of pain, suffering, trauma and anxiety. What about consequential loss such as medical costs and, in some cases, loss of earnings?</P>
    <P>Many of these victims have had further misfortune visited upon them in so far as they have found it extremely difficult to engage in the normal life practices in which we engage, for example, the maintenance of a permanent job. Will compensation be payable under the heading of loss of earnings? Will there be aggravated damages in cases which might be highlighted as especially heinous? Deputy Kenny made the point about housing and I concur. What priority will be given in the housing area to victims who wish to resume what might be described as normal living? That is as far as residential victims are concerned. Daingean, one of the more notorious institutions, is in my constituency of Laoighis-<Col N="984" /> Offaly. Over the years hundreds if not thousands of people were detained there.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with those who were resident in such institutions but those same institutions were more than residential in that there was not much of a choice. People were involuntarily detained in them. While the trauma, hardship, anxiety and hurt visited upon school students are recognised, the fact that some students were abused while in day care and in day schools under the supervision of the State and were not in residence or detained should not be a bar to an entitlement to compensation or an inclusion under the legislation. Otherwise, the State is failing in its responsibilities. The State has said that, in residential institutions, it and the Minister acted <i>in loco parentis</i>. While I accept that, from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. or from 9.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. teachers in primary schools throughout the country act on behalf of parents. I do not accept the distinction the Minister makes.</P>
    <P>There is a clear implication in what the Minister said that, if children in day schools had a problem, they were expected to have told their parents who might have intervened and that the difference between those in residential care and those in day care is that the element of parental intervention was not available to those in residential care. We know the position was very different. The climate of the day was such that it was not expected that children in day schools suffering at the hands of abusive teachers would complain to their parents. The likelihood was they would not receive much of a hearing at home. It is unfair for the Minister and the State to say parents of children in day schools should have had such a burden of responsibility thrust upon them and that they should have intervened to stop the abuse in the first instance. It is an argument with which I do not agree.</P>
    <P>The intervention at the time was probably negligible in any event. I point to a case in my constituency with which I am familiar where there was an element of intervention in so far as a formal complaint was made in 1982 to which the Department did not respond and the same sorry tale can be told of the bishop of the day. It was not as though parents were going to intervene. They did not, and to say they should have is cold comfort. In the case I mentioned, it is clear there was a cover-up on the part of the Department of Education and Science. I do not say that lightly, but all the facts of the case point in that direction. I challenge the Minister to rebut my charge.</P>
    <P>The Bill, by ignoring the claim of the non-residential victim, is unjust and immoral and adds considerably to the hurt and trauma of those victims. I accept that the process of healing must take place and I acknowledge that for many it will but it must do so for all victims and not just those detained in residential care. It is wrong that a day care victim can be treated in a fundamentally different way or as a lesser being than those detained in residential care. I welcome the recent statement by the religious orders that they will <Col N="985" /> engage in the compensation process. I want to know how much. There is also a difficulty concerning a waiver clause. It would be unfair to expect someone to sign such a waiver clause without knowing the level of compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making a grave error by saying that victims who were day pupils cannot make a claim because, at the time, they were under the care of their parents when clearly they were not. While I acknowledge a measure of progress, this job will not be completed until such time as all victims are entitled to a fair measure of compensation for their loss, damage, trauma and anxiety.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. No matter what we do, we will not be able to compensate in any adequate way for what happened to so many citizens. While this measure is described as a redress Bill, it cannot give redress for what happened. People's lives have been taken away from them from an early age in institutions where they were directly or indirectly in the care of the State. We need to acknowledge that and that there will never be closure on this issue, no matter what measures are taken by the State. There will always be effects and results which cannot be addressed either through legislation, compensation or any other measure available to the House.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is our duty as parliamentarians to take whatever action can be taken. The Bill is just part of a number of measures which are a response to the extraordinary revelations in the television programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, books written previously and subsequently and stories told to us and many others, especially to the Laffoy commission. That these events occurred in the State in this century should make us hang our heads in shame.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with this part of our response as a people. Inevitably we must discuss it in the context of what has happened already. The apology by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State was welcome and had to be made but is not an appropriate atonement for what happened to people. They were abused when powerless and without a champion. Their lives were taken from them because of what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My involvement as a parliamentarian was mainly through the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 2000, which was among the first legislation with which I was involved as a Member. Obviously that legislation is interwoven with the Bill because people will have to make a choice between going to the civil courts or going before the redress board to try to obtain some small and inadequate financial compensation. Nevertheless, to obtain financial compensation they will have to make decisions with regard to <Col N="986" /> taking the civil course or going before the redress board. In that regard, I support Deputy Shortall in the amendment she has proposed. We do not have enough information at this stage as to what will be on offer, as to what form of compensation will be available, or as to what degree it will address the issues that arise for individuals.</P>
    <P>Many cases will not be addressed effectively under this forum. Obviously, it has advantages for some in that it takes them away from the courts of law, which may be appropriate. Nevertheless, I would like to see as many options left open as is possible. That is the reason I wrote to the Minister earlier in the summer asking that the Statute of Limitations option should not be closed to those whose time was running out and did not have enough information with regard to which option they should take. That should still be the case and the Statute of Limitations should not be pleaded by the State in cases where people's time has run out. They should still have the option of taking either route in terms of redress.</P>
    <P>Many may still not have the appropriate information. Many are living in different corners of the world. By virtue of the fact that many were in institutions and did not get appropriate opportunities in terms of education etc., they may have personal difficulties with regard to accessing the kind of information they require with regard to the options available. This is very complex. There are a number of avenues such as the commission, this legislation and the civil and criminal courts. As many options as possible should be left open and as much advice as possible should be made available.</P>
    <P>For that reason I compliment the various organisations which have been established to support victims of abuse on the information they have made available to those who otherwise would find it impossible to access the various avenues open to them. I agree with Deputy Kenny that these groups should be given appropriate financial support. I refer particularly to the organisation, Survivors of Child Abuse, which has been involved from the beginning. When I was involved in the legislation with regard to the Statute of Limitations, its input was extremely important. It has also called for a delay until we get the relevant information with regard to the options available.</P>
    <P>I also support those who have spoken in favour of the right of day students to be included in this legislation. In many cases, that they were day students and went home did not, as Deputy Flanagan outlined, give them any more protection than if they had not gone home. It did not protect them from abuse. A case has been made by a group of day students who have initiated court action under the Statute of Limitations legislation. They should be entitled to take this route if they wish. There is no reason to exclude day students in general, but the Minister might consider this group in particular, if he is not willing to consider the totality of students.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kenny said, there is a case for those <Col N="987" /> on the other side, who believe they have been falsely accused, to have an opportunity to defend themselves and state their case. This case has been made by CORI and for reasons of justice, it should be allowed. Their voice should be heard in order that people will not be accused of actions which they did not carry out. Not everybody was complicit. Many were innocent and many protested and tried to change the system. However, it was so invidious and so all-pervasive that they were not able to affect what was happening.</P>
    <P>It is very important that, as legislators, we do not close this issue at any date or time. There are survivors of abuse for whom there will never be closure, whose lives have been indelibly changed, ruined in some cases, as a result of what the State did to them in its institutions. We need to continue to listen to these individuals, and those who represent them, and keep our minds open as to what further recompense can be made, and what further action can be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the advantage of not having to repeat what Deputy O'Sullivan has just said. I very much agree with the practical proposals that both she and the Labour Party spokesperson on this matter, Deputy Shortall, have outlined.</P>
      <P>I was the spokesperson on education when we discussed the Committee Stage of the Laffoy commission legislation. My recollection of that time was that the terms of reference, and the legislation, were proposed narrowly and ungenerously. I fought tooth and nail to widen them to include the full circumstances of the child's abuse. I recall clearly having to make the case, for example, that &ldquo;establishing responsibility&rdquo; did not just concern the responsibility of the person in charge of a building, or of a person in a particular post, but of all who had access to the child in multiple settings, and in different circumstances.</P>
      <P>Around this time it became clear that vital files were missing from the Department of Education and Science, covering one of the most notorious periods of its neglect in relation to this matter. I have a difficulty with those who now say that this was a dark time in Irish history. The difficulty I have with this apologetic mode is that it tends not to be explicit where we must be explicit in relation to the abuse of authority involved. Children were removed from parents and placed in institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of the MacBride commission and remember its hearings in Dublin. When people came before us and told us of their experiences in prison they were afraid. That was in the 1970s and is evident in the printed report of the commission. We could not use some of the material because we had not received permission to print it at the time. I was often haunted by some of the details in that report, including those concerning children collected at the railway station in Galway to be brought to Clifden to one of two institutions; details concerning children <Col N="988" /> who were thumped and had chest bones broken; and details concerning people lent out to farmers. I said that the Bill that concerned the MacBride commission could not confine itself to a building. What about those responsible for taking children out to the fields, those who allegedly went camping, and those who brought children for a day out? There is no merit in simply saying that this was a dark time in Irish history. Those with responsibility claimed and abused authority, both that of the State and in the institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>I remember when a friend, Mannix Flynn &ndash; who will not mind my mentioning his name &ndash; wrote his book, <i>Nothing to Say</i>. Mannix was in Letterfrack. This information has been known for quite a while. At the time of the Kennedy report an issue may have arisen between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science. When a message came it might have been seen as doing more harm if it came out than if it did not. There was closure; a closing off of the facts and an inability to face up to anything.</P>
    <P>The most sensitive man who appeared before the MacBride commission was a former chief attendance officer from the Dublin area. He said if we could only get them early on, the children concerned would not end up in prison, and that they were wonderful people. In the recent book, <i>Suffer the little children: the inside story of Ireland's industrial schools</i>, by Mary Raftery and Eoin O'Sullivan, there is an interesting point when it mentions a Department of Education and Science probation officer who reported to the Department that he had congratulated those who did their job, and many who were concerned. The probation officer's report details a brutal beating of one of the inmates, a boy from Sligo, and that he was informed of this by an attendant. The probation officer's report points out that this beating consisted of numerous punches with a clenched fist which reduced the boy to a whimpering mass. The concluding portion of this incident was witnessed by the matron and the complete incident took place in the presence of all the inmates at the time. The individual goes on to say that this was a savage, uncontrolled beating accompanied by expressions from the attendant in which the word &ldquo;dirtbird&rdquo; was mentioned on quite a few occasions. When this matter was reviewed and pressed it was stated that this was a violent and difficult boy. That is what gets into the Department's files.</P>
    <P>I could go on. Another case refers to the fact that a particular person had a great reputation for keeping discipline but that, perhaps, he should be more restrained. When I was spokesperson on this issue, we heard of a person being stripped naked at midnight on the landing in Daingean, yet all the files are missing, except for two pages quoted in this book.</P>
    <P>This is not the time for obfuscation or attempts at hiding. A total of 55,000 people, the largest number of people ever to emigrate from this country since independence, did so in 1955. How <Col N="989" /> many people have gone to England? How many people with ruined lives are in England? Have they no right to come back? In all the procedures, should we not decide all the categories which will flow from the commission? People will need to come back and some will need counselling.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in all of this is that, if it is not done properly, it will accord the greatest possible pain to people as they try to recover from their experiences. I support Deputy O'Sullivan's comments and the contents of Deputy Shortall's amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall also referred to another speech and there is another important context. Frances Finnegan's book describes what happened in the Magdelen laundries. When I first stood for election in 1969, I met a woman who had come out of the laundry in Galway for the first time. What about these and other settings into which people were placed? </P>
    <P>We must not approach this issue in the manner in which we began before the commission by keeping the process as tight as possible. The correct procedure is, having looked at all the categories thrown up by way of fact by the commission, to specify how we propose to approach the issue. We will then be able to look at the quality of the legislation and the orders made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I reject the notion, and it is a cop out to suggest, that everything was the same in those days, that if those involved had not helped these children, no one else would have done so, and that the events took place out of some kind of misplaced charity or whatever. That is a nonsense. Our Constitution and the democratic programme of the first Dáil specified the rights of the child. Those rights were also being prosecuted internationally in conventions. There is no excuse. It is wrong to place any kind of gloss on these events which suggests that the times were bad and enables officials or those responsible to run in all directions without facing up to what they perpetrated against young, vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>In this context, the distinction, for example, of whether the child was residential or in the school for the day is a nonsense. Can it be suggested that a person who abuses authority against a vulnerable person will make a distinction between boarders and children attending the institution on a day basis? That is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister should at least seek to address the issue of those who had the courage to take their cases. He should try to give an assurance that no one who has been put through this awful experience will be excluded from consideration. Tens of thousands of lives have been ruined and wonderful people are trying to come to terms with, and reconstruct, their lives. If we are to assist that process, everything should be construed generously. We should provide assistance to, and encourage groups. We should not have been so mean about the legal advice and support which had to be fought for every step of the way. All of this is the test.</P>
    <P>Are we legislating for a narrow way out of all <Col N="990" /> of this by, first, painting the period as the dark period? Department officials and those who ran institutes have questions to answer. People who knew what was going on said nothing. There were those to whom complaints were made who refused to act. There were reports after reports. Most sinister of all, a senior civil servant, writing to a junior civil servant, suggested it would be better if this did not come out. The reason was that we were refusing to vindicate the rights of the child. If one is going forward after such events, it is important to be able to face up to them so that, ultimately, one may hope for some kind of closure. If one wishes for such a closure, the matter has to be faced in its fullness.</P>
    <P>It is important, and the Minister would be supported, if he published a draft of his proposals. He should let us see what categories he proposes to redress and what distinctions will be drawn between them. How does he propose, for example, to put other non-financial mechanisms in place to seek to rebuild people's lives? What is wrong with that? However, if the Bill is passed without these changes, we will have the commission and an expert report and it will be up to the Minister to decide how to respond regarding regulations.</P>
    <P>It is a time for generosity and including, rather than excluding, more people. No obstacles or inhibitions must be put in the way of people who may wish to come forward. Many things can be done which are not simply financial. They include institutional measures by making different State resources available.</P>
    <P>I went to the industrial school in lower Salthill where I saw these people. They later made a good job of reconstructing their lives, but they carry the marks. We also carry the marks in that we allowed authoritarian men and women to abuse vulnerable people in such a manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill and recognise his efforts in this area. No financial reward will ever fully compensate these victims for the humiliation, degradation and loss of self-esteem they have suffered. One such person told me that there could not be a God who allowed people to undergo such suffering. The Bill has deficiencies which have been outlined by various speakers and I hope the Minister will accept amendments tabled by Deputy Creed and others.</P>
      <P>One individual who has attended my clinics for the past three years is seeking clarification on the issue of his being criminalised by virtue of the fact that he was committed to an institution. Deputy Creed tabled a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue asking him if, in the context of the Government's proposal to compensate victims of abuse in institutional settings, his Department has given any consideration to the revocation of the criminal status of residents in such institutions; and if he would make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply the Minister referred to the Chil<Col N="991" /> dren Act, 2001, but gave no suggestion that the slate would be wiped clean in this case. Will the Minister consult Deputy O'Donoghue on this issue? Many of the people concerned were incarcerated for crimes which do not merit a criminal record, and many for no crime at all.</P>
    <P>The individual to whom I am referring was born out of wedlock. His case had to go before a judge in a court who committed him under the Public Order Act. He has never committed a crime in his life and would like the matter to be examined and addressed.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledging widespread public concern about the matter and being strongly of the view that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any allegations of wrongdoing by its members are investigated thoroughly and that, if such allegations are found to be well-founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings are initiated;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;wanting to see the truth of this matter determined and public confidence in the Garda Síochána, in so far as it has been adversely affected, restored;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;being of opinion that, in this case, the public interest in a full, public and impartial ventilation and determination of the facts, and a consideration of the issues of public policy arising therefrom, outweighs in importance the customary need to ensure pending or anticipated criminal proceedings are not put at unnecessary risk of frustration;</P>
    <P Just="Center">hereby resolves as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">(1) that it is expedient that a tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998 (&lsquo;the Acts'), to inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann and make such find<Col N="992" /> ings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>a</i>) the Garda investigation into the death of Mr. Richie Barron at Raphoe, County Donegal, in October 1996, including the arrest of several members of the McBrearty family and the alleged securing of a confession to murder from Mr. Frank McBrearty junior;</P>

    <P Just="Center">(2) that the tribunal should be requested in particular, in the light of its findings and conclusions, to make whatever broad recommendations it considers appropriate for securing and maintaining the independence and integrity of the Garda Síochána in the disinterested performance of its functions, while at the same time ensuring the accountability of its members within an administrative system of oversight that is impartial and effective and secures the public trust;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(3) that the tribunal should be requested, to the extent that it may do so consistent with the provisions of the Acts, to conduct its inquiries in the following manner:</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>a</i>) to carry out such preliminary investigations as it thinks fit using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts (including, where appropriate, the power to conduct its proceedings in private), in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to above to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry in relation to those matters;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>b</i>) to inquire fully into all matters referred to above in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist, and to report to the Clerk of the Dáil thereupon;</P>

    <P Just="Center">(<i>d</i>) in relation to any matters where the tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the tribunal thinks appropriate on the steps taken by the tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed, and</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>e</i>) to report on an interim basis, not later than three months from the date of establishment of the tribunal or the tenth day of any oral hearing, whichever shall first occur, to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:</P>

    <P Just="Center">(iv) any other matters which the tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P Just="Center">(4) that the person or persons selected to conduct the inquiry should be informed that it is the desire of the House that:</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>a</i>) the inquiry should be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>b</i>) any costs incurred by reason of the failure of persons to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the inquiry, including by reason of</P>
    <P Just="Center">(i) the giving of false or misleading information to the tribunal,</P>
    <P Just="Center">(ii) the raising of an issue before the tribunal, whether by way of allegation, counter-allegation or defence to such an allegation, which is unfounded or irrelevant or is abandoned or not pursued by the party which raised the issue, or</P>

    <P Just="Center">should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those persons;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>c</i>) the tribunal should authorise the representation before it by solicitor or counsel of persons claiming an interest in the matters the subject of its inquiry only where and to the extent necessary to protect the legal or constitutional rights of those persons and should both authorise and confine the participation of legal representatives in its public proceedings accordingly;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>d</i>) the tribunal should negotiate arrangements with a television broadcaster in the State, on terms satisfactory to the tribunal, for the live broadcasting of the entirety of its public proceedings;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(5) that the Clerk of the Dáil should on <Col N="995" /> receipt of any report from the tribunal arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas immediately thereafter.</P>

      <P>I know from speaking to individual gardaí that they are deeply concerned by <Col N="996" /> the events and how the affair has developed in County Donegal. It is in their interests also that the air should be cleared. It is demoralising for the Garda and undermining its authority. Internal Garda investigations seem to be leading nowhere. A dark cloud has accumulated over the force, which seems to be unjustified and unfair. The Minister's strategy seems to be to do as little as possible. For the last five years he has presided over a deteriorating situation. The appointment of an eminent senior counsel with access to all the files will, in all probability, end up in a <i>cul de sac</i>, as previous investigations have done.</P>
      <P>We, in County Donegal, have confidence in the Garda Síochána as a whole and want to see its confidence and authority restored. If there have been misdemeanours, or worse, it is in all our interests, including those of the Garda Síochána, that they should be exposed and any wrong-doing punished. No one is above the law.</P>
      <P>As the only non-Government Deputy from County Donegal, I welcome the motion to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the McBrearty affair and related matters. The people of County Donegal are as concerned and anxious as I am to bring this episode to an early and satisfactory conclusion. All previous attempts have failed to achieve this objective. It is time to lance the boil before it becomes malignant.</P>
      <P>The bereaved Barron family want to know how their father died. The McBrearty family, the McConnell family and the Diver family from Ardara want to know on what evidence they were wrongfully singled out for the harassment and intimidation to which they were subjected.</P>
      <P>Ordinary rank and file gardaí in County Donegal want the matter brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and have their authority and morale restored. The people of County Donegal want an end to the uncertainty and confusion, and have their confidence in the Garda Síochána restored. Only a tribunal, as proposed in the motion, is capable of achieving this objective and I will certainly be supporting its establishment. I wish to compliment the spokespersons in my own party, Deputies Shatter and Jim Higgins, as well as those of the Labour Party and the Green Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party is proud to be a signatory to this motion, with the Labour Party and Fine Gael, which calls for a full tribunal of inquiry into the alleged misconduct of certain members of the Garda Síochána in County Donegal. The inquiry is imperative, not just for the sake of those alleging harassment and gross violation of their civil liberties, such as the McBrearty family, and the close relatives of Mr. Richie Barron, killed in Raphoe, County Donegal, in 1996, but also for the Garda Síochána. We must maintain public confidence in the police force, but this confidence has been eroded as a consequence of these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a high regard for the Garda Síochána. I know from my constituency work, as, I am sure, <Col N="997" /> many Members of the House do, how hard, varied, demanding and invaluable its work is. The Garda Síochána has a high reputation, due in no small part to the fact that it is an unarmed force. It has served the country well. It has also served the wider international community, since 1989, as part of UN forces in a number of countries. Garda Sergeant Paul Reid gave his life when, as a member of UNPROFOR, he was killed in Sarajevo's so-called sniper's alley in 1995.</P>
    <P>The first head of the Garda Síochána, Commissioner Michael Staines, argued that &ldquo;the Garda Síochána will succeed, not by force of arms or numbers, but by their moral authority as servants of the people.&rdquo;  That is exactly the reason the motion is before us today. The moral authority of the Garda Síochána has been undermined by events in County Donegal, and so has its reputation as &ldquo;servants of the people.&rdquo; The allegations against the Garda Síochána are serious; they go to the heart of our democracy and Constitution.</P>
    <P>The reputation and role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, however, is also under scrutiny. There has been, to say the least, a lack of urgency on his part and that of the Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>Let us look both at the known facts and the allegations. We now know that Mr. Richie Barron was not murdered along a road in Raphoe, County Donegal, on 14 October 1996, but was the victim of a hit and run accident. This was not known until nearly five years later, this July, after his body had been finally exhumed. This raises a number of appalling questions and issues. It also points to a number of mistakes and inexcusable delays. It raises questions about the Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The original autopsy was obviously inadequate. Reports show that the accident scene was not properly preserved, and the assumption that gardaí were operating under, at the scene and thereafter &ndash; that this was a criminal assault &ndash; was clearly incorrect. At the heart of the need for a tribunal is the fact that a confession was allegedly made by Mr. Frank McBrearty junior, to a murder that was not, in fact, ever committed. This is a confession that Mr. Frank McBrearty says he never made and signed.</P>
    <P>Linked to all this are allegations from the McBrearty family and staff at Mr. Frank McBrearty senior's licensed premises in Raphoe, of police intimidation, rough interrogations and general traumatic treatment, including over 150 summonses under the licensing, road traffic and Public Order Acts, being served over a six month period in 1997. All these summonses have now been withdrawn, but this has happened with no apology or explanation being given.</P>
    <P>Then there is the mystery surrounding the exhumation order on the late Mr. Richie Barron. On 10 October 1997 the coroner in County Donegal asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for an exhumation of Mr. Barron's <Col N="998" /> body. Within six days, however, the Garda Síochána told the Minister to put a hold on the application. It was not until four years later, on 10 July 2001, that the exhumation finally took place, showing that the injuries to Mr. Barron were consistent with a hit and run accident, not murder. Why was there such a delay? Why did the Garda Síochána ask for the body to be exhumed at the start of the week, change its mind by the end of the week, and convince the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do nothing about this highly controversial case until a few months ago?</P>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter pointed out in the House yesterday, why did it take until 13 November before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform revealed anything about these 1997 requests? Did he not question what was going on, or did he simply not investigate?</P>
    <P>While there have been three internal Garda investigations, there has been no official report and no one has been charged with anything. We know from <i>Magill</i> magazine, not from the Minister, that one of the internal Garda reports found that 53 mistakes were committed by the Garda Síochána in the initial investigation. This is, to say the least, disquieting.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now announced the appointment of Mr. Shane Murphy, an eminent senior counsel, to &ldquo;examine all the relevant papers and the progress on these investigations generally with a view to his receiving expert independent advice as to whether there are any measures that might now be taken to bring matters to finality, sooner rather than later.&rdquo;  Despite Mr. Murphy's undoubted abilities, this approach will not, and cannot, be fully satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A tribunal is the proper route to clear up what has been an upsetting and unsettling course of events. For these matters to be adequately addressed there will be a need for all documentation held by the Garda Síochána on this issue, including the three internal investigations and the files held by the Director of Public Prosecutions, as well as the full co-operation of all sectors of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I understand we may have two votes on this motion tonight. I am hoping Deputies Blaney and Gildea might have the courage of their convictions and support the motion.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister tried to traduce the reputation of the Green Party, saying that we had not learned from previous mistakes. He referred to a judgment delivered on 26 June 2000 by Mr. Justice Haugh and said that the Green Party had prejudiced the trial of certain people. He quoted Mr. Justice Haugh as saying:</P>
    <P>For similar reasons I also believe that the leaflet captioned &ldquo;Jail the Corrupt Politicians&rdquo; has similar potential for real and substantial prejudice not only because of its contents but also the position and status of those announced as due to speak at the rally concerned.</P>
    <P>While the Minister did not mention me by name, <Col N="999" /> I was due to speak at that rally. I have to tell him, however, that we had nothing to do with the publication of any leaflet. We are aware of how easy it is to prejudice someone's trial. This needs to be examined because the way things are at present one could get a friend to ring up a radio station or talk to the press and say that a person should be jailed and the person concerned can then claim they cannot get a fair trial. There is something wrong about this and it needs to be examined. The Minister said that what we are saying here and what we are calling for could prejudice a trial. He should examine this. If a tribunal of inquiry is done correctly, it should not prejudice someone and and his or her trial. The families have given assurances they will stop all civil proceedings to facilitate such a tribunal of inquiry. A full tribunal, a sworn inquiry, is what is required to clear this matter up once and for all and restore the reputation of the Garda Síochána which has served us well.</P>

      <P>Before I laud the Minister for his approach to this affair I thank Deputies Shatter and Howlin for tabling the motion. It is right and proper that such matters of public interest are discussed in the Dáil. This debate will help the Barron family, the McBrearty family, the McConnell family and all the other families concerned. It will help the people of County Donegal who want, as Deputy McGinley said, to get on with their business and also help to restore confidence in members of the Garda, particularly those who are innocent and act with integrity in County Donegal. Deputy Shatter stated last night that the members of the force undertake their duty with great dedication. Deputy Howlin said we are exceptionally fortunate to have an unarmed police force, such as the Garda Síochána, to deal with paramilitary and other criminal groups and that it has done a splendid job. There are almost 12,000 members &ndash; perhaps there are 1,000 more than Deputy Howlin said last night &ndash; of the Garda Síochána. However, only a minuscule number are involved in practices we do not and cannot condone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of parliamentarians are to legislate, represent and, most importantly, oversee and scrutinise the actions of the Executive and its bosses, the Ministers. It is right and proper that this is done by Deputies in the House. Both Deputies Howlin and Shatter excel in this role and it would be a great loss to the country if they did not remain in that position in opposition to ensure such scrutiny continues in the years ahead. Such scrutiny is done through debates, questions, on Private Members' Business and through the media. I saw Deputy Shatter on RTE news this <Col N="1000" /> evening and he not only mentioned the McBrearty affair, but another matter which will come into the public domain in the next 24 hours. Scrutiny is also done through committees of the House, such as those involved in investigating the mini-CTC system and the Abbeylara affair.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a tribunal is a matter which should be done as a last resort and only when all other avenues have been exhausted. Those avenues have not yet been exhausted. There is a belief that a tribunal is a panacea for all things. Last night Deputy Rabbitte suggested the beef tribunal was a whitewash. He also suggested that the 1921 Act under which tribunals operate is antiquated, out of date and difficult to operate under. Before a tribunal is established and before it can be successful it is necessary to have a preliminary investigation which sets out the facts of the matter in a manner which facilitates the taking of evidence in an effective and efficient manner, just as the Comptroller and Auditor General did in the DIRT inquiry. The motion suggests that the tribunal should be established and then an investigation should be carried out in private. There is an incongruity in this. The Minister has appointed the eminent legal person, Shane Murphy, who will have access to all the Garda and departmental documentation.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is that of constitutional rights and the question of whether those charged with criminal offences have a right to defend themselves and have cases against them heard at the earliest possible opportunity. It is the case that successive Governments have allowed the criminal process to take its course. It would be a dangerous precedent if a tribunal was put in place at this early stage. There are problems in relation to gardaí and complaints against them. I congratulate the Minister for publishing the new arrangements which will govern future complaints against the Garda Síochána. I look forward to the establishment of the independent inspectorate. The Minister is adopting the correct approach in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues we are addressing this evening are of the utmost importance for the McBrearty family, which no one can gainsay, the family of the late Richie Barron, the effective administration of justice and upholding and vindicating the rule of law, one of the primary obligations we, as legislators, have in this area. We should be mindful in any recommendations or conclusions we reach here that we operate under a clearly defined constitutional position where the separation of powers is absolutely established in our Constitution, part of which is the independence of the Judiciary and the judicial function which involves the examination on their criminal sanction of matters of criminal law or the examination on their arbitration or hearing of both sides in matters of civil law. Our constitutional role, as legislators, however impatient we might be from time to time with the instances, cases or judgments of some judges, is not to set ourselves <Col N="1001" /> up individually or collectively as being equipped, qualified or in a special capacity to reach the conclusions on how others should do their business.</P>
      <P>I speak as someone who recently celebrated 40 years as a member of the Bar and almost 37 years as a Member of the Oireachtas. I have some experience in this area, both as a Member of the Oireachtas and as a member of the Bar. For that reason I recall the precedents we followed here. I was a Member of the House in 1974 when the then Government, which I applauded then and which I applaud now &ndash; we were in opposition at the time &ndash; introduced the legislation establishing the independent function of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, was enlightened legislation. It deserved the support it received in the House and has been vindicated in experience since. It has meant, for example, that those of us who might be approached from time to time, although I always resist any such approaches, can point to the fact that under the legislation the Director of Public Prosecutions is required to be independent in the discharge of his or her duties.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, section 6 of the Act states that it shall be unlawful to communicate with the Attorney General or an officer of the Attorney General or, in this instance, the Director of Public Prosecutions or an officer of the director acting in his official capacity for the purpose of influencing making of a decision to expedite, withdraw or not to initiate criminal proceedings. That puts it all in context. It is the sole independent function of the Director of Public Prosecutions and unlawful for anyone of us to try to change this. If we were to adopt this motion collectively, I will not say the House collectively would be guilty of a criminal offence &ndash; I appreciate the thinking of those who submitted the motion &ndash; but at the same time we would be sailing very close to repudiating that which was established when the Opposition was in government and on which I commend it. I have always supported that independence.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, there is justifiable cause for concern about the events surrounding the death of Richard Barron and the focus on the McBrearty family. Nobody is denying this. To that extent I empathise with the Opposition. Having said that, it is important to realise that the best guarantee, the best protection, is to use the law and its procedures to vindicate and protect the good name of families such as the McBreartys and ensure if there are gardaí who actually breached the standards required of them by all of us and the public, they are made amenable to the law and the statutory disciplinary sanctions in the Garda disciplinary code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says they have not worked. In that case he had better tell the Director of Public Prosecutions. If we are to rely on the wisdom, judgment and capacity of the <Col N="1002" /> Deputy to reach a conclusion, as distinct from the functions established under law by the House, then I am afraid we will often be chasing our tail. We would do the same if we just relied on my judgment. I am not claiming I have better judgment than anybody else.</P>
      <P>The Minister has acknowleged, quite properly in my view, just as a matter of personal judgment, that there is cause for some considerable concern and for this reason suggested that he is proposing to the House that perhaps a preliminary inquiry be established by him under a colleague of mine at the Bar &ndash; it does not matter who he is, another colleague is a senior counsel. That is a practical suggestion. If we want to introduce what has been suggested this evening, for which I have a certain degree of support, particularly in respect of what the McBrearty family has gone through, we ignore the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions has already initiated prosecutions against six people, including, as far as I know, a Garda sergeant. Do we want to frustrate these? Do we not know this from our experience of tribunals? I was the one who established the first tribunal.</P>

Will we ever hear the end of this matter, once and for all? Have we heard the end of the beef tribunal, once and for all, as the Deputy said then? Have we heard the end of the Flood tribunal, once and for all? Have we heard the end of any of the tribunals, once and for all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>That jargon is trotted out all the time. While these tribunals sit, we know that the most important principle to which every citizen is entitled and which the Supreme Court has pointed out so often is a fair and proper trial under judicial process. This principle is not only compromised, but delayed. We all know that justice delayed is justice denied. Our courts were established under the Constitution which we have respected and enhanced, I hope, to protect these fundamental rights. While we all have great sympathy for the families who have been traumatised, it is important we do this in accordance with procedures established here which we have to respect in the interests of the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another independent function in our <Col N="1003" /> Constitution, that of the Attorney General when advising on matters of law. The Office of the Attorney General has clearly stated it is not appropriate to establish a judicial sworn inquiry at this time. I am simply saying for all these reasons it is appropriate that anything we do now will not undermine respect for the rule of law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much support what the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said on this Private Members' motion last night. He enunciated in unequivocal terms his views and those of the Government on the matters raised by the motion. I take this opportunity to say we must all uphold the law at every opportunity and where illegal wrongdoing takes place, it must be rooted out with vigour and determination.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about the situation in County Donegal and want to see the facts of the matter established. We want to ensure those who have been involved in criminal activities are brought to justice. It is an absolute imperative that any alleged wrongdoing is investigated thoroughly and that the necessary and appropriate proceedings are taken, but equally due process must be respected in accordance with the laws of the State. As the Minister said last evening: &ldquo;I know some are frustrated with what they see as the delay in having the truth of this matter established but let us be clear about one thing, we intervene with the criminal process at our peril.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are no shortcuts in the pursuit of justice, no quick fixes in bringing the guilty to book. We cannot disregard legal principle for political expediency. I want to see the truth determined, but it must be determined in accordance with the law. The integrity of criminal proceedings is the sole responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We should tread very carefully in this Parliament in order to ensure we do not fall into the domain of work that is the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Criminal trials have been halted before because of political literature distributed by political parties. There are clear divisions between the roles of the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Government. We must respect the lines of responsibility across these organs of State. It is important for all of us that this is the case. I want to see justice in these matters and nothing short of it. I strongly believe that this is the overwhelming view of Members. That is only right and proper. Where differences lie in the House on this matter, they relate to how best we can approach the issue now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much support the views expressed by the Minister when he rightly pointed out that the two most successful inquiries in the State were superseded by an investigation by an eminent and qualified person. The work of the McCracken tribunal was preceded by an investigation by Gerard Buchanan. The work of the Finlay tribunal was preceded by an investigation by Judge Mir<Col N="1004" /> iam Hederman-O'Brien. Let us be clear about one thing. We do not want to prejudice possible future prosecutions that may arise out of the events in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>It is the consistent view of the Government that where there is wrongdoing we must allow the criminal process to take its course and, on the civil side, allow the normal civil law process to strike a balance between the rights of individuals and State bodies. There have already been criminal prosecutions in County Donegal concerning the issues before us and, according to the Minister, the Director of Public Prosecutions is presently considering these cases. The Minister has also said that if at the end of the normal civil and criminal processes a level of public concern still remains about this particular case, there can be a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>On a related matter, the Government has published new arrangements which will govern future complaints against the Garda Síochána. It has put in place measures for the establishment of a new Garda inspectorate which will have the capacity to examine every aspect of Garda operations from the point of view of best policing practice. It will be wholly independent in the carrying out of its operations. It will oversee arrangements for the handling of complaints independent of any other body, including the Garda Síochána, which has a high reputation. Gardaí are highly respected for the professionalism with which they carry out their duties. However, wherever there is wrongdoing on the part of individual gardaí, appropriate structures must be put in place to deal with it. I am fully confident that the Government is dealing with all these key pertinent issues by appointing an independent eminent legal person to conduct an independent review of all the relevant papers involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGildea" hpid="Mr. Gildea Mr. Gildea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gildea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to speak on the motion. I find the vast majority of members of the Garda Síochána to be professional, decent people who carry out a difficult job in society. They are the thin blue line who stand between society and the criminals. I acknowledge that their task is not only difficult, but in many ways thankless. However, it goes without saying that if there are some among them who do not come up to standard, it is necessary that the offending members should be weeded out and subjected to the full rigours of the law in the same way as any other law breakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Garda Síochána in the McBrearty case and other similar and related cases in County Donegal is a sad episode. It has been an awful experience, not only for the McBrearty family, but for a number of other families, including the Diver family in Ardara who were victims. Let us make no mistake about it, victims they are. They were the victims of Garda harassment. While the McBrearty case did not occur in my constituency, I have a large amount of knowledge and information on it. I have very intimate and personal knowledge of other incidents in my con<Col N="1005" /> stituency of Donegal South West, including Garda treatment of the Diver family and other related matters, especially the burning of a portacabin, the property of Cable Management Ireland, the company which bought the MMDS franchise in County Donegal from the Minister with responsibility for communications in a previous Government, Mr. Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>I would like to expand on the role of the Minister for Justice in the rainbow coalition on all these matters pertaining to Garda activities in south west Donegal from 13 December 1995 up to its dissolution in 1997. It was during Deputy Owen's term of office that a force of up to 100 gardaí was amassed for use against the local law abiding rural population of the Ardara-Glenties area. At a later date, almost one year later, the burning of the portacabin and the finding of an explosive device at the site of the proposed MMDS transmission site led to the controversial arrest, detention and interrogation of the Diver family.</P>
    <P>On that point, the role of the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in these matters should be examined. The Garda Síochána in County Donegal was subjected to unacceptable pressure by her.</P>

My television was on and I heard Deputy Gildea make an allegation about something I had ordered as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I <Col N="1009" /> left my office and ran to the Chamber. On my way over, the Deputy went further and made an allegation of criminal illegality against me. Had I committed the alleged actions as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I would have been required to resign my ministry.</P>
      <P>To protect my good name, the name of the country and those who exercise the role of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I cannot allow you to let the business of the House proceed. When the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform leaves office, he, too, will want his good name protected against allegations related to actions he took as Minister. I hope the Minister recognises that the action alleged made here tonight did not and could not have happened. Had I done what he alleged, I would be required to appear before a court. I want Deputy Gildea to withdraw his remarks, for which not a shred of evidence has been produced. He has besmirched my good name and the corporate image of all those who have held the position of Minister for Justice in this State.</P>

I also suggest you are given an opportunity to review on tape what was said in the House before returning to deal with the matter in the fashion in which these matters are usually dealt with by the Chair. Failure do so would create the difficulty, be it in Private Member's time or on other occasions when you are absent from the Chair, of creating open season for Members to make accusations of any nature on the basis that in your absence the matter would not be properly dealt with.

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>What we are debating this evening is what we associate with the dreaded secret police in former communist East Germany. It is the kind of case that we have associated with the Russian KGB. It is certainly not what one would expect to find in the quiet hills of County Donegal. We are dealing with one of the most sinister, ruthless and malicious cases of Garda corruption in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>It was a trumped up murder case based on a total fabrication by gardaí in County Donegal using false and discredited witnesses, some with criminal convictions, and other former Garda informers. Had the conspiracy not been exposed, an innocent family, the McBrearty family of Raphoe, would be behind prison bars this evening serving long sentences for a crime of which they are totally innocent.</P>
      <P>The net outcome is that the McBreartys and their family have been destroyed emotionally, physically and commercially. They have endured humiliation and the embarrassment of false arrest and imprisonment. They are now left with the impossible task of trying to pick up the pieces and put their lives back together again.</P>
      <P>Instead of trying to vindicate their good name, restore their character and make recompense, they continue to be disgracefully treated by the Government. Having been acquitted of any taint of association with the death of the late Mr. Richie Barron, the McBrearty family are still awaiting an apology from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for the damage inflicted on them. The Minister owes them an apology. He should avail of this opportunity. He also owes an apology to the widow and family of the late Richie Barron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By changing the focus and direction of the inquiry from a hit and run accident to a murder inquiry, the Garda introduced a hugely upsetting and traumatic dimension into the lives of the <Col N="1013" /> already grieving family of the deceased. The Barron family were led to believe by the Garda that their loved one had been murdered. For three years they repeatedly asked themselves the reason anybody would want to deliberately kill their father and husband. Year after year, they publicly remembered the anniversary of his death by inserting a long list of memorial notices in the local newspapers: &ldquo;In loving memory of my dear husband who was viciously beaten and left to die on the 14th October 1996&rdquo;; &ldquo;Cherished memories of a special dad brutally beaten and left to die&rdquo;; &ldquo;In loving memory of a dear father who was brutally murdered on the 14th October 1996&rdquo;; &ldquo;In sad and loving memory of my brother Richard, who was murdered on the 14th October 1996 R.I.P.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All the while, the gardaí involved knew well that this was no murder case. Mr. Barron died from injuries consistent with a road traffic accident. This was the conclusive finding of the post mortem examination. This was the conclusive finding &ndash; we are led to believe &ndash; of a further post mortem carried out by the State pathologist, Dr. John Harbison, last July.</P>
    <P>The Minister owes an apology to the Barron family for allowing them to continue in the belief that Mr. Barron had been murdered. He owes them an apology for presiding over a Garda force which, five years and one month later, has still not established who killed the head of the Barron household. He owes the McBreartys and the public an apology for presiding over a total charade and cover-up, because that is what is at issue. He is singularly responsible for this farce. He repeatedly said that if he was not satisfied with the manner in which the Carty inquiry, and the other Garda inquiries, were conducted, he would have no hesitation in establishing an independent inquiry. We are still waiting for it.</P>
    <P>We demand that independent inquiry this evening. The Minister has done nothing. We have had the initial road traffic accident investigation. We had the accident investigation, followed by another investigation &ndash; a murder inquiry. We have had the Carty inquiry, the results of which are still locked somewhere in the bowels of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We have had an inquiry into the treatment of Garda Tina Fowley. We have had the Garda Complaints Board investigation. We have had the investigation by Assistant Commissioner Fachtna Murphy and Superintendent Pat Brehony in respect of the information brought to the Minister's attention privately and personally by Deputy Brendan Howlin and me. All the inquiries and investigations have not yet arrived at any definitive outcome. From a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whose flag of convenience was zero tolerance, all we have had is zero interest, zero action and zero results, but what could one expect from a bombaster?</P>
    <P>I have before me a copy of the false confession of Frank McBrearty Junior. On the bottom of page 3 is Frank McBrearty's forged signature. <Col N="1014" /> After all the inquiries, the Minister has failed to establish who forged it.</P>
    <P>I also have a copy of a statement made by a female Garda officer who was in the precincts of Letterkenny Garda station while the McBrearty family were being abused in custody. In her statement she states that, on 4 December 1999, she was on duty at Letterkenny Garda station. She was detailed for duty in the incident room. There were a number of persons in custody in connection with the murder of Richard Barron, including two of the main suspects at the time, Mark McConnell and Frank McBrearty junior, who are in the Public Gallery tonight. During the course of the afternoon the Garda officer was present in the conference room. Seated on the left hand side at the lower end of the room were other gardaí. A senior Garda officer, whom she names, was seated at the conference table facing the door, almost adjacent to it. He was writing on an official half sheet. The female Garda officer had cause to retrieve some papers from a nearby table and, in so doing, passed behind the officer. He turned and showed her the half sheet on which he had been writing. It was a sepia coloured ruled half sheet. There was writing on this sheet of paper, covering approximately one third of the page. There was the name of Frank McBrearty written in longhand at the end of this writing. She goes on to say that in front of the officer was a black and white photocopy of a manuscript signature of the name of Frank McBrearty. From her recollection, this signature was a photocopy of form C8. The Garda officer showed her the half sheet and asked her was &ldquo;that a good likeness&rdquo;. She goes on to say: &ldquo;I took this to mean were both signatures alike. I thought it was a practical joke. I started laughing and so did he&rdquo;. She returned to her seat and the officer left the room with the papers on which he had been working. The bangharda took this to be a ruse and thought no more about it until recently when concerns about the veracity of the statement of admission obtained had been expressed in the media.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the McBrearty family in custody was appalling. Frank McBrearty senior was arrested at 7.55 p.m. on Friday, 5 December 1996 from his home in Tullyrapp, Raphoe. There were at least 30 gardaí present. He was arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act. He was placed in a patrol car which was followed by detectives in other cars and taken to Letterkenny Garda station. During questioning he was repeatedly abused. His GP was sent for and arrived and having examined Mr. McBrearty indicated that his blood pressure was very high and advised the gardaí that he was in danger of having a heart attack or a stroke and that he should be taken to hospital. He was taken to Letterkenny General Hospital and while still in Garda custody, he was told he must watch what he said. He was then transferred by ambulance to Blanchardstown Hospital escorted by two gardaí. While in hospital he was watched by the gardaí 24 hours a day. His family was not allowed to visit him. <Col N="1015" /> After being transferred back to Letterkenny Hospital, Dr. Brian Callaghan, a consultant, wrote a letter dated 11 December 1996 indicating that while he could be discharged from hospital he should not under any circumstances be interrogated as this would lead to further illness.</P>
    <P>Mr. McBrearty was released from hospital on Thursday, 12 December 1996 and taken again by gardaí to Letterkenny Garda station at 4.35 p.m. Various accusations and allegations were thrown at him regarding the death of Richie Barron. He was placed in cell No. 4 at 9.10 p.m. At 9.27 p.m. he was taken from the cell and interrogated until 10.15 p.m. He was kept in Garda custody overnight. Mr. McBrearty at this stage was complaining of chest pains. At 8.35 a.m. on 13 December he was again interrogated and accused of bribing people. He subsequently suffered a black out. However, the interrogation continued in spite of his dizziness and chest pains. Dr. McColgan arrived and recommended that Mr. McBrearty be taken to hospital for high blood pressure and for an ECG examination. He was again taken to Letterkenny hospital with a Garda presence at all times outside his room. He was transferred to Beaumont Hospital on 17 December again under constant Garda surveillance. Finally, he was released for Christmas. There then began a sustained campaign of Garda harassment of the McBrearty premises. More than 160 charges were brought against the family until these were finally thrown out by the DPP.</P>
    <P>Frank McBrearty senior, Frank McBrearty junior, Mark McConnell and his wife Roisín McConnell were all disgracefully treated while in Garda custody. Roisín McConnell is a nervous wreck today. She has had to receive psychiatric treatment and may never recover from the trauma inflicted on her. Cock-ups and mistakes can happen in any walk of life but we are not dealing here with a monumental cock-up. What we are dealing with here is a deliberate miscarriage of justice. What we are dealing with here is a calculated decision taken within the Garda by senior gardaí to finger and frame the McBrearty family. Five years later the Carty inquiry or any of the other inquiries or investigations have failed to establish the facts. They failed to establish who made the decision or the basis for the decision to abandon the hit and run investigation and to change the focus to a murder inquiry.</P>
    <P>The medical evidence is quite clear. Richie Barron died from injuries which were consistent with having been involved in a road traffic accident. They failed to establish who was driving the car. In his affidavit sworn on 21 April 1997 Chief Superintendent Denis Fitzpatrick states: &ldquo;while the indications were that Mr. Barron died in a hit and run accident his injuries were consistent with death having been caused by &lsquo;other unlawful means'.&rdquo;  The inquiries have failed to establish how Chief Superintendent Fitzpatrick arrived at this grossly misleading conclusion. They have failed to establish where the medical evidence <Col N="1016" /> was for giving any kind of substance, support or credence to such a statement made under oath.</P>
    <P>The crucial Garda conferences which brought about the change of direction were held on 2 and 3 December 1996 at Letterkenny Garda station. At the 2 December conference a decision was made to contact Garda Headquarters in Dublin and seek the assistance of the Cobra Unit. At the 3 December conference all members of the Cobra Unit were handed copies of alleged false statements made by persons who have now been charged and are before the courts. The Cobra Unit was told to base its interviews by sticking strictly to the alleged facts in the alleged fabricated statements of these persons who have now been charged. On the following day, 4 December, Frank McBrearty junior and his cousin Mark McConnell were arrested. On the following day, 5 December, Frank McBrearty senior was arrested and subjected to the maltreatment at the hands of gardaí that I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>The inquiries have failed to establish why the McBrearty family was selected as the main suspects for the murder inquiry. There was not a scintilla of evidence either forensic or circumstantial against them. The family was well respected. They were good citizens &ndash; good members of the community. Frank McBrearty senior had been nominated by the people of Raphoe as mayor of Raphoe. They were successful business people having come home from Scotland and ploughed their hard earned money into developing their business. Not only were they never in trouble with the law but they would be seen as Garda-friendly people. However, for some reason yet to be established, they were hand-picked and criminalised.</P>
    <P>The inquiries have failed to establish why the gardaí decided to bring a specially trained garda from Dublin to install bugging equipment in the GRA room on the ground floor of Letterkenny Garda station to bug conversations between the McBrearty solicitors and their clients.</P>
    <P>Superintendent Kevin Lennon sought an exhumation order on the body of Mr. Barron in October 1997. This was granted by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. Why was that order not proceeded with? The inquiries have failed to establish who made the decision to block the exhumation which would have confirmed four years ago what Dr. Harbison established four months ago.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the plethora of inquiries have failed to establish the truth. They are Garda conducted inquiries carried out by the gardaí into alleged misconduct of fellow gardaí. They are secret inquiries conducted behind closed doors. Evidence is not taken under oath. All they have done is fuel frustration, confusion, doubt and cynicism. Last night the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reiterated his decision to institute yet another secret inquiry where files will be examined by a lawyer behind closed doors yet again. We must establish the truth and that can only be done in an open, transparent public <Col N="1017" /> forum. It is patently obvious that five years and one month after the death of Mr. Barron and despite numerous Garda inquires, we are still nowhere near the truth. The only way the truth can be established is by establishing a tribunal of inquiry. The gesture of the McBrearty legal team to agree to park the civil proceedings to enable such a tribunal to be established clears any obstacle to such a tribunal.</P>
    <P>What is quite clear is that a policy decision has been taken to delay, long-finger and to stop the truth coming out until after the next general election. That is extremely serious for the McBrearty, Barron and Divers families who have been subjected to harassment and wrongful and damaging accusations relating to the planting of explosives on the MMDS mast at Ardara in County Donegal. It is a serious matter also for the Gallagher family from St. Johnstown, the integrity of the criminal justice system and the Garda. The damage to the reputation of the Garda by the mishandling of this affair is enormous. The damage to public confidence in the Garda is enormous. This is not a local Donegal issue. This is a national issue that goes to the very core of the public's faith in the police force established to protect the citizens of this land. Unless the truth is established, unless all the gardaí responsible for the perversion of justice and for the gross abuse of their positions are brought to book and are dealt with in public, a lasting lingering cloud will hang over the force for many days to come.</P>
    <P>I now want to put to Deputies Blaney and Gildea, in the bluntest possible terms, what they are facing tonight. These two so-called Independent Deputies from Donegal will be crucial in determining the final outcome of this debate. They should reflect long and hard before they walk up these steps. This is an acid test of their independence. This is the moment of truth as to whether they have any independence of mind or judgment.</P>

        <b>: </b>This is the final determination of whether Deputy Gildea and his colleague are their own men or are simply two mud-guards on the Fianna Fáil juggernaut. I hope Deputy Blaney is watching. His primary responsibility is to his constituency and the electorate of Donegal North East who elected him to this House. Will he abandon tonight, two families from his constituency who have been so badly treated by this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government? If Deputy Blaney votes with the Government tonight it proves beyond &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo; that he is an ex-officio member of Fianna Fáil and should do the decent thing; go back to where he belongs and join Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To Deputy Gildea, I say, rhetoric is fine but rhetoric will not suffice tonight. It simply will not wash. Deputy Gildea should recall the issue <Col N="1018" /> which parachuted him into the Dáil four years ago &ndash; the television deflector issue.</P>

        <b>: </b>I am sure Deputy Gildea will recall that among his strongest supporters were the Divers family from Ardara &ndash; they are in the gallery tonight. As a result of their unstinting support for Deputy Gildea, they, like the McBrearty's suffered considerably at the hands of the Garda. The Divers family stood by him loyally in his hour of need. Is he now prepared here in this House tonight to abandon the Divers family in their hour of need? Deputy Gildea should ask himself that question. Will he betray them, his constituents, his friends and local supporters? If he does, upon his own head be it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken many times on Private Members' motions over the past 15 years. This issue is the most serious and has the greatest consequences for our country. I was brought up to have and show respect for all institutions of the State. It is necessary that our people have confidence in our police force and hold it in the highest esteem. The Garda Síochána has a major role throughout the history of this State in the preservation of our constitutional democracy. It is necessary that it continues to preserve that position and play a vital role in our society.</P>
      <P>The McBrearty case has been festering like a bad sore for the past five years. The evidence and innuendo spoken of and written about in this case has caused many people to question the role of the Minister and the Garda. While there have been numerous investigations into the death of Richard Barron, the Minister or the Garda have not been cleared of wrong-doing. What is required is a judicial public inquiry so that the police and general public can deal once and for all with the alleged wrong-doing of the Garda or the State.</P>
      <P>The kernel of this issue is that some members of the Garda Síochána framed a man for murder, a murder that did not take place. For the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allow something as serious as this to drag on for more than four years without resolution is unbelievable. It goes back to GUBU. If I were in the Minister's position I would, at least, want my name cleared. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I would not preside over a cover-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to ask the Minister a number of questions to which I hope he will take the opportunity to reply. Can he tell us why an exhumation order of Richard Barron's body was sought from his office by the Donegal coroner following an application from the Garda on 10 October 1997? Why did the Garda on 6 October 1997 request that exhumation to be put on hold? What senior member of the Garda requested the exhumation order to be put on hold and what were the reasons for that request? Did the Minister not <Col N="1019" /> find this request unusual? Hindsight can be 20:20 vision but if the exhumation order had been allowed in 1997, Dr. Harbison's conclusions, which were only dealt with last month, would have enabled the Garda to deal with this issue once and for all. Can the Minister confirm that a number of gardaí who were suspected of wrong-doing in the initial investigation into Richard Barron's death in 1996 were assigned to the Carty team to participate in his investigation of the process in 1999? Why was this allowed to happen? When serious allegations are made against members of the Garda Síochána it is vitally important that such allegations are fully and properly investigated within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to allow this situation to continue over a four year period is, at best, incompetence on his behalf. If he is not committed to establishing the truth in this case to restore his own reputation, he should permit a public inquiry to take place to allow the reputation of the Garda Síochána to be restored to its rightful place of respect and high esteem in our society. It is necessary for the future of our constitutional democracy that this festering sore be lanced once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the call for a public inquiry into the conduct of the Garda Síochána in County Donegal since the mid-1990s. Such is the scope and seriousness of the issues raised in this motion that they challenge not only the conduct and management of the Garda in County Donegal but also at a State level. They also challenge the stewardship of the Department and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>It may be that only a small number of gardaí were directly involved in the sinister events which have come to light since the death of Richie Barron in Raphoe in 1996. However, clearly those activities could not have continued without the knowledge of many more within the force both in Donegal and outside it. At the core of this scandal is the attempted frame-up of Frank McBrearty junior for the murder of Richie Barron. This involved a forced and false confession, the arrest of other members of the McBrearty family and a catalogue of harassment against the McBreartys and others over a long period.</P>
      <P>One of the most notable features of this case is the internal Donegal Garda division circular of 27 February 1998 signed by Superintendent Denis Fitzpatrick. It referred to &ldquo;attempts to discredit gardaí from this division and other members involved in the Barron investigation.&rdquo; It went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is information to hand which suggests that Frank McBrearty (Snr) from Raphoe . . . is financing a campaign to discredit members of the force . . . Members of your district force and gardaí who have assisted in the investigation into the Richie Barron death should be notified of the matter and directed to report any incidents or unusual contact that may occur <Col N="1020" /> either with Mr McBrearty or his extended family. This document is for garda use only and is confidential.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a letter to lawyers for the McBrearty family a senior garda officer said he was not aware of the existence of such a circular. However, gardaí later informed Donegal District Court that the circular existed. It gives an extraordinary insight into the thinking of gardaí involved in this case. If this was what was committed to paper we can well imagine the attitude that prevailed in the privacy of the Garda station.</P>
    <P>The case of a Strabane man, Edward Moss, was also remarkable. He made a personal injuries claim against the McBreartys and won a substantial out-of-court settlement. However, he was then pressurised by gardaí to take an assault case against Frank McBrearty junior. Mr. McBrearty was acquitted, but Edward Moss's solicitor, John Fahy, later had to write to the gardaí concerned to ask them to stop harassing his client to make further statements. John Fahy told <i>Magill</i> magazine in September 2000 that he had stopped taking cases in County Donegal courts because of Garda conduct. He said:</P>
    <P>Gardaí were intimidatory to me as an extension of the client. I accepted that situation prevailed in the North but I had expected more from the gardaí in the South. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I'd rather take my chances in a Northern court.</P>
    <P>In the light of the huge questions raised about the Garda in County Donegal, any future inquiry must also encompass the Garda investigation into the murder of my party colleague, Councillor Eddie Fullerton, a Sinn Féin member of Donegal County Council, who was murdered in his home in 1991. The Fullerton family have raised concerns about the role of the Garda in the case, surely a very grave matter given the indications that the murder involved collusion by British forces.</P>
    <P>The McBrearty case shows that gardaí were acting with total impunity in County Donegal. They used the draconian powers available to them under the Offences Against the State Act for nefarious purposes and nobody held them accountable. Such was the regime that prevailed that certain gardaí were able to set up bogus arms finds to further their own careers within the force.</P>
    <P>This case shows the need for the reform of policing in the State. There needs to be fundamental reform of the Garda, with an independent complaints procedure, the disbandment of the special branch and the repeal of the Offences Against the State Act. The Government cannot with credibility call upon the British Government to transform justice and policing in the Six Counties when it has clearly failed to keep its own house in order. The Minister has kicked this issue into touch. He hopes it will be buried until after the general election. However, a public inquiry must and will be held sooner or later. It should be held now and let the truth be told.</P>

      <P>The stages involved in a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act, as amended, were set out by Chief Justice Hamilton in the Haughey <i>v.</i> Moriarty case, reported at [1999] 3 Irish Reports, page 1, as follows:</P>
      <P>A Tribunal of Inquiry of this nature involves the following stages:</P>
      <P>1. a preliminary investigation of the evidence available;</P>
      <P>2. the determination by the tribunal of what it considers to be evidence relevant to the matters into which it is obliged to inquire;</P>
      <P>3. the service of such evidence on persons likely to be affected thereby;</P>
      <P>4. the public hearing of witnesses in regard to such evidence, and the cross-examination of such witnesses by or on behalf of persons affected thereby;</P>
      <P>5. the preparation of a report and the making of recommendations based on the facts established at such public hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us are aware that tribunals established under the 1921 Act, through no fault of their own, do not necessarily result in a speedy resolution of the matters sent to them. In recent years two tribunals of inquiry, the McCracken tribunal and the Finlay tribunal, have successfully and speedily completed their work and reported. The speed and efficiency of both tribunals have been the subject of favourable comment in the House and <Col N="1022" /> elsewhere. It is not a coincidence that each of those successful and effective tribunals was preceded by an expert investigation carried out by an eminent and suitably qualified person. The McCracken tribunal was preceded by the examination conducted by retired Circuit Court judge, Gerard Buchanan, and the Finlay tribunal was preceded by the examination conducted by Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien.</P>
    <P>It should be acknowledged that the people who made the decisions to appoint those expert investigators were Members of the Opposition who were then in government. The decisions they made contributed significantly to the success of those inquiries and the precedent they set is a good one which should be followed. I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on following the precedent set by the Opposition while in government&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in his decision to direct an examination to be conducted by an independent and qualified person.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to stress that this decision is the start of a process. No door has been closed. No final decision has been made other than the one that the truth must come out. Whatever means is lawfully available to the Government will be used to ensure the truth is established and that every appropriate lawful action is taken to ensure justice is done and seen to be done.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to address this issue responsibly without having regard to the constitutional requirement of due process. We live in a democracy where citizens have given to themselves certain rights and those rights belong to citizens. They are not ours to bestow or withdraw as we please. We are governed by those rights in our actions. No matter how expedient or convenient it may be to set those rights aside, we cannot do so. Our constitutional structure, not only requires, but also demands that we uphold those rights.</P>
      <P>Included among those rights is what the Supreme Court has referred to as the constitutionally superior right to a fair trial. The Supreme Court has determined that this right is superior to the community's right to prosecute, our right to comment freely on issues of public importance and the natural and healthy inquisitiveness of the public. Necessary and obligatory respect for the constitutional rights of others at this stage of the legal process is the reason it is not possible at this stage to have a public inquiry under the 1921 Act. I stress the words &ldquo;at this stage of the legal process&rdquo; because decisions on possible prosecutions need to be taken within a reasonable time. I do not believe the rights of individuals to constitutional due process can forever cloak matters of legitimate public interest. In the short-term, however, they not only can, the law and the Constitution say they must.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addressing the House on 11 September 1997 <Col N="1023" /> on the topic of the establishment of the Moriarty tribunal I had reason to refer to the Latin maxim <i>fiat justitia ruat caelum</i>&ndash; let justice be done though the heavens fall. So let it be in County Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share the time left to me with Deputy Noonan. I want to make three legal points in response to the dirge last night from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and repeated in part in legal terms this evening by the Minister of State. Either the Minister is being wilfully misleading about his understanding of the law or his legal advice is woefully poor.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister accused the Opposition of setting aside a key legal principle: that in the hierarchy of legal rights the right to a fair trial is paramount. It is. While we are not threatening to expose anybody to an unfair trial, we acknowledge that the approach we adopt may mean no trial. As the Chief Justice confirmed in the case of Moriarty <i>v.</i> Haughey, in approving the word of Lord Justice Salmon: &ldquo;There are, however, exceptional cases in which such procedures must be used to preserve the purity and integrity of public life without which a successful democracy is impossible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That we are supported in our approach by the McBrearty family, who are in the Public Gallery, should be more than enough for the Minister. In his trawl for further red herrings he suggested that the Opposition motion was contradictory in that it advocated a preliminary private inquiry. The Minister failed to inform the House that the exact procedure set out in our motion was used by the Moriarty Tribunal, established by this Government, and its validity was endorsed in the case of Haughey v. Moriarty by our Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The final spurious legal point raised by the Minister that I wish to address is his assertion that civil cases impede a tribunal of inquiry. In the case of the Supreme Court judgment of Mr. Justice Costello in Goodman International and Hamilton (No. 1), Mr. Justice Costello said that there is nothing in the Constitution which prohibits the two Houses of the Oireachtas from directing that a tribunal of inquiry be established to inquire into allegations of matters the subject of current civil proceedings. He said that such an inquiry does not infringe on the principle of the separation of powers and that the Minister may validly act on such a direction, and the tribunal may validly inquire into such allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the bombast of Deputy O'Kennedy, the words of Mr. Justice Costello could not be clearer. The real question is why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is prepared to demean the law in the way that he did yesterday evening. I say to him, as one citizen to another, that, in this Republic which we share <Col N="1024" /> and in whose Government he currently serves, he has an awesome responsibility. How he exercises it will be held to account long after he ceases to be a Minister in this Government, and long after he ceases to be a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister is an officer of the court by virtue of his profession as a solicitor. If he refuses the request of this House for a public inquiry, that decision will haunt him for the rest of his life. The Minister has presided over a litany of evasion and cover-up that has been put on the record of the House by Deputy Jim Higgins. In some cases information was brought to the Minister in confidence and trust by Deputies Howlin and Jim Higgins more than 18 months ago &ndash; in June last year &ndash; and the Minister has done nothing. He has given no reason as to why he has sat silent and done nothing.</P>
    <P>Some day, there will be a public inquiry and the Minister will not be able to sit in silence as he now does because he will be before a tribunal under oath. He will have to answer then as to why he did not act now. As one citizen to another, I wish him well in that respect. On behalf of this democratic assembly, I apologise to the McBrearty family for the hell that they have been put through and for the abuse of power that was exercised in our name in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most serious debates that has ever taken place in Private Members' time in this House. It was a great pity that the debate this evening was spoiled by the outrageous attack launched by Deputy Gildea on our colleague Deputy Owen, who was a most distinguished Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and about whom, outside the House, no-one would dare make the kind of allegations that were made here tonight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen has served in the Oireachtas for over 20 years. She has always been honourable in her dealings and has been direct, frank and honest. She was one of the best Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the State has had. She took on organised crime when it was difficult to do so and by putting the Criminal Assets Bureau in place, and by reforming the law, she made a serious impact on standing down organised crime in Ireland. It was outrageous that a Deputy who sought to draw a red herring across the debate, because he is letting down his county-men and county-women, friends and supporters, would cause a deliberate distraction by attacking such an honourable Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen's family has served the State well. It was her grand-uncle Michael Collins who in 1922 served in the first Government of this State that founded the Garda Síochána. Since the foundation of the State to the present we have been extraordinarily well served by the Garda Síochána. Some 80 years is a short space of time in the life of a nation but in the difficult circum<Col N="1025" /> stances that pertained in the early years of the State, the Garda achieved universal acceptability. That acceptability is one of the main factors that has contributed to the success of the Garda Síochána over the years.</P>
    <P>There were other factors, principally the dedication and integrity of individual members of the force. This dedication has led to the deaths of 30 gardaí in the course of their duties since the force was founded, ranging from the first garda to die, Henry Phelan who was shot dead at Mullinahone in County Tipperary while buying hurleys for a hurling team in Callan in County Kilkenny that the station party had started. That was on 8 November 1922. The most recent death of a garda on duty was that of Sergeant Andrew Callanan who was on duty in Tallaght Garda station on 21 August 1999 when a man entered, poured petrol out of a can and set it alight with a flare. Sergeant Callanan lost his life while attempting to save the life of the man who had done this.</P>
    <P>We have a dedicated Garda force with a reputation that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should defend. They have been in the front line of the defence of democracy for many years and have, particularly in recent years, displayed extraordinary personal courage in the face of provocation and attacks from the Provisional IRA. Every day they went out, when the IRA campaign was being conducted in the South as well as in Northern Ireland, they knew that they were putting their lives on the line. They learned that there was danger and they faced that danger. The House is well aware of those like Garda Jerry McCabe who lost their lives in the course of their duty in combating terrorism in this State.</P>
    <P>I say that to set this debate in context. The biggest problem for us tonight is that the events in Donegal, which have been described so eloquently by my parliamentary colleagues, have caused great disquiet, not only in Donegal but right through the State. We have a situation where the inactivity of this Minister is undermining the Garda Síochána. I accuse the Minister of failing to vindicate the rights of the McBreartys, the Barron family, the Divers from Ardara and of many other citizens in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Minister of deliberately failing to inform this House of the exhumation order which was forwarded to his Department back in September 1997, and again failing to inform the House that this request was subsequently withdrawn and that no explanation was given by the Garda Síochána. Yet, the Minister came to the House, answered questions, accepted the confidence of Deputies Jim Higgins and Howlin, and never informed them of some of the basic facts that were relevant to this case. This was even to the point when he must have known that a file was forwarded to the DPP in 1998 which said that, in the opinion of the DPP, <Col N="1026" /> there was no case to be answered and a serious doubt as to whether a murder took place. That has been substantiated by the State pathologist in recent months.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Minister of undermining the Garda Síochána by letting this scandal run and run to the point where confidence in the Garda in Donegal is virtually destroyed and where it is ebbing nationally on a weekly basis because of his inactivity. Some on this side of the House have been Ministers for Justice and are proud to have been so. Some are proud of their records despite the fact that others might criticise us. There have been Ministers with good and bad reputations in the Department, as in any other. However, whatever legislation the Minister steers through the House, or whatever action he takes which forms part of his political CV, if he leaves office in a couple of months' time having undermined public confidence in the Garda Síochána through his inactivity, procrastination and a combination of inactivity and unbridled arrogance, he will go into the history books, on that issue alone, as the worst Minister who ever served in the Department.</P>
    <P>If it were not for the Garda, we could not sleep at night. This is not, and never has been, a gentle society. The Garda keeps people safe on the streets and in their homes and beds. The essential mortar which keeps the force together is the fact that the public has confidence in it and will continue to have confidence in it if the Minister takes action.</P>
    <P>The Minister must root out any bad apples in the Garda. There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of crime committed by the Garda in County Donegal against people sitting in the Public Gallery. It is the responsibility of the Minister, and no other Member of the House, to ensure the rights of people whose rights have been transgressed are vindicated and that wrongdoing is exposed to the light of the truth.</P>
    <P>While the public will continue to support the Garda, it will not support Garda activity which is hidden, swept under the carpet or covered up. The Minister has a responsibility, not only to those in the Public Gallery and their relatives in County Donegal, or the wider community in County Donegal and around the country, but also an absolute responsibility to preserve the integrity of the Garda Síochána. The only way this can be done is by him conceding and agreeing to the Opposition's motion for a full public inquiry into this scandal.</P>
    <P>The Minister must let in the light, as that alone will restore confidence in the Garda. It is his responsibility to act, no one else has the power to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 38 to 42.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to avoid section 9(4) of the Bill which would have the effect of excluding part time workers from eligibility for a pension scheme. The directive on which the legislation is based does not permit any blanket exclusion, yet the Minister is proceeding in a fashion that will prevent part-time workers, people who work less than 20% of the normal working hours, from participation in a pension scheme. That is an extraordinary provision. It is exclusive. I cannot understand why it is there. There is no legal barrier currently in the way of anyone working less than 20% of the normal working hours being eligible for a pension scheme, and many such people are already in pension schemes. Will the Minister clarify whether this will put a legal impediment in the way of their being in a pension scheme?</P>
      <P>We find ourselves in the farcical position that this Bill will be guillotined at 10 p.m., yet a large number of amendments have not been dealt with. The farcical intervention of Deputy Gildea tonight not only does an injustice to his constituents in Donegal, but he has proceeded to do a considerable injustice to part-time workers in Donegal because we will not be able to take amendments other than those sponsored by the Minister. The Minister advises me privately that he has responded positively to the case I made on behalf of the Labour Party in respect of a number of matters I raised on Second and Committee Stages. I appreciate and welcome that.</P>
      <P>However, there are still a number of matters that go to the heart of this Bill. There are almost 300,000 part-time workers. Therefore, this amendment is a matter of some import. If one is a teacher for instance, with eight hours teaching content, that is quite a number of teaching hours contact. I made the point on the last occasion that there are many people in secure positions protected by Act of parliament in full-time professorial jobs who do not work much more than eight hours a week, apart from nixers in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. It is regrettable the Minister of State is ploughing ahead with this. I hope that even at this late stage he will change his mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that we are running out of time. I clarify that I will accept amendments on the basis of what Deputy Rabbitte and his party suggested during the debate. Amendment No. 12<i>a </i>is an alternative to Opposition amendment No. 12 in regard to the protection of an employee for giving evidence in any proceeding under the Act. Amendment 12<i>a </i>is an alternative to Opposition amendment No.12 on the issue of penalisation by an employer of an employee in circumstances for refusing to transfer from full-time to part-time work or <i>vice versa</i>. In case we do not reach those, I acknowledge the contributions made by Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Broughan on those two issues.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Rabbitte, we have responded to the Opposition's suggestions on the issue of 20% of normal hours of work. Section 9(4), as amended on Committee Stage, provides in effect for the exclusion of part-time employees who normally work less than 20% of the normal hours of work of a comparable full-time employee from access to pension schemes or arrangements under the Bill. It was considered that such persons should be excluded from such schemes on the grounds that the administrative costs of providing for such access to persons with such little service would be far in excess of any benefits that might accrue to them from such pension schemes. Deputies will recall that this issue was originally raised on Second Stage. Some Deputies felt that in the case of certain full-time teachers and lecturers, to whom the Deputy referred, who normally work a maximum of 22 hours a week, the threshold of eight hours would have the effect of excluding a high proportion of such part-time teachers and lecturers. It was felt the threshold might be better expressed in such circumstances as a percentage of the hours of comparable full-time workers. I was happy to address these genuine concerns on Committee Stage by means of an amendment incorporated in the current text of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition amendment No. 8, however, proposes the deletion of section 9(4). The amendment agreed on Committee Stage goes a long way towards addressing the concerns raised by Deputies during Second and Committee Stages. For the reason I outlined, I do not propose to accept this amendment. The administrative costs involved would put people in an impossible position in terms of the administration of such a measure. We are talking about very small monetary costs. What we are doing is workable. The Opposition has contributed to improving the Bill <Col N="1033" /> in terms of the idea of 20% of normal working hours. That is the right approach. That is the position and I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister of State said about expressing the hours to be worked as a proportion of normal working hours, 20%, rather than eight hours is a modest improvement, a suggestion I made on Second Stage. However, he has not dealt with the fundamental grievance, which is the exclusion of all workers working less than 20% of the normal working hours from eligibility for a pension scheme. I asked him to say if where there is no legal barrier currently, there will be one in the future because it seems the new threshold will exclude these persons from any pension scheme or arrangement. This is especially discriminatory towards women. I wonder whether it will demonstrate any infirmity in the legislation if challenged on that basis. The great preponderance of workers in this category happen to be women for reasons I do not have time to elaborate on and in any event Members will be familiar with them.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to address the phenomenon of people who are pressed into more than one part-time job. If a person is working twice eight hours a week in different employments, would that person be eligible to join a pension scheme? This is an important point. There are time constraints. One cannot do anything in this House anymore, it is regimented and guided by rules. This is an important matter and I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's last question, if a person had different employers, that person could have different pension schemes. On the Deputy's question of a possible legal impediment, it would not change existing arrangements. The law, as it stands, would apply. Any concerns the Deputy may have should be based on the current legal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have improved the earlier Bill brought before the House. We have taken on board the idea of 20% of normal hours of work, with reference in particular to teachers and lecturers. We have made some amendments, which due to the time constraints, we will not reach. I outlined to the Deputy in private what we are doing. It is not our fault that those of us who are debating this <Col N="1034" /> Bill are in this situation. We have debated this Bill at length. It is important that we bring the directive into law. There have been some delays in relation to this. I appreciate the co-operation of the House to date. It is important that we pass this legislation because, as the Deputy rightly identified, it will allow part-time workers to be treated much more favourably than they are at present, particularly the many women who work in part-time employment.</P>
    <P>I hope I answered the queries the Deputy had on this section. I confirm that there are other elements later in the Bill that we have amended, including clarification on amendment No. 12<i>a</i>, as requested by the Deputy on the question of penalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>The parents, teachers, board of management and, not least, the pupils of St. Coleman's boys national school, Macroom, are fed up to the back teeth with the delay and prevarication by the Department of Education and Science in dealing with their request for a new school. Unless the Department acts swiftly recent developments in this matter will leave the Exchequer facing costs for a school that will be significantly greater than they would otherwise have been.</P>
      <P>St. Coleman's boys national school has 130 pupils and eight teachers. Projected enrolment figures envisage the appointment of at least one more teacher in the near future. Given the huge number of recent housing developments in Macroom, pupil numbers are expected to grow. Planned improvements to the main Cork-Killarney route, the N22, are expected to lead to further developments which will increase the town's population even more along with the enrolment at the school in question. At present, the campus of the school straddles the N22 which poses a significant danger to the health and safety of pupils and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 23 April 1997 the chairman of the board of management wrote to the Department of Education and Science seeking the provision of adequate accommodation at St. Coleman's. In June 1998 the then Minister, Deputy Martin, issued instructions to the school's board of management to commence the design process for the project. The issue of the school securing a site extension was deemed extremely important as it was needed to allow the <Col N="1037" /> project to proceed. In October 2000 the school's principal and the chairperson of the board of management met a local property developer who had just purchased the lands to the rear of the school. The developer proposed to supply the school with a new two acre site in return for the existing school site. He even suggested that the proposed development to the rear of the school would be done in two phases. Phase one was to prepare a temporary entrance to the school site to allow for the new school to be built. When that school was completed, phase two of the project would see the existing school being knocked, allowing for the rest of the development to be completed. A proposal outlining all of this was forwarded to the Department of Education and Science in December 2000. A Department architect viewed the new site shortly afterwards but no recommendations were made until March 2000 when a feasibility study was requested. The study was completed in May and forwarded to the Department.</P>
    <P>In September 2001 the developer, frustrated by the inaction of the Department of Education and Science, made one last offer to the school's board of management. A school site was offered to the board of management for a paltry amount with payment required within three weeks, otherwise the deal was off. A decision to pay the sum was communicated to the Department and a commitment was sought that it would build a new school on the site. Further clarification was sought by the Department regarding the fact that the site proposed was to be serviced. Eventually and way beyond the deadline set by the developer, that commitment was given. By this time the developer had gone elsewhere to seek an entrance to his lands that would allow him to proceed with his project. A recent meeting with the developer, who needs to commence his project immediately, will probably result in the existing school being demolished along with the provision of temporary accommodation on a portion of the new school site. A proposal from the developer that is to be issued to the school's board of management, envisages that he will prepare the temporary site and may even provide the temporary accommodation. However, that will only be in the short-term. The reality is that a new site for the new school is being provided by the school's board of management. A temporary site and accommodation in the interim is being provided by a property developer.</P>
    <P>The net question which parents, the board of management, teachers and pupils are asking is &ldquo;Where is the evidence of the commitment of the Department of Education and Science to this project?&rdquo;. If the Department does not seize this opportunity the project will eventually cost the Exchequer, the State and taxpayers much more than it should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science in relation to the building project for the school to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> At present the school's staff comprises a principal, four assistants, one resource teacher, one shared remedial teacher and one shared special teacher for Travellers. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 129 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of five classrooms and an application has been received from the school authorities for the provision of appropriate improved accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million or 470.4 million. That is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled the Department to undertake a record number of building projects and it is intended to continue this rate of progress to overcome the deficit arising from past years and while meeting the needs of the present day.</P>
    <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects &ndash; including a project at the school referred to by the Deputy, currently at architectural planning stage &ndash; will be taken, as in previous years, in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the chair for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for attending to reply.</P>
      <P>One of my fellow county men recently declared the Celtic tiger to be dead. Tonight I will provide this House with evidence that agrees strongly with his statement. This morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> carried a story on an INTO study on the extent of educational disadvantage in our primary schools. The study identified 73 &ldquo;hazardous and seriously substandard primary schools&rdquo;. The INTO deemed those schools to be unsafe for pupils. Among the schools identified was St. Joseph's national school, Rathmore, in south Kerry. It is a monument to the neglect by this Government of the educationally disadvantaged. It is a testament to a Minister who is out of touch, unwilling to reform and blissfully unaware of and unconcerned by the hardships being experienced at St. Joseph's national school, Rathmore, on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will paint a picture of the conditions that pupils and staff have to endure every day. At present there is not actually a school. The old school has been demolished and pupils and staff are currently housed in three prefabricated buildings on what looks like a building site. The staff and parents have begged this Government for four or five years to build a new school. The Government has continually delayed, ducked and dodged acquiring a site for the new school. There is no clarity on the issue and no guarantees have been made as to when a new school might be built. The old school was in such a shabby condition that it was knocked last August. The Minister then promised three brand new prefabricated buildings to be provided on a temporary basis, but only one new one and two completely sub-<Col N="1039" /> standard ones have been supplied. Only one of these has a toilet and some of the children still have to use the old outdoor toilets which are all that remain of the old school.</P>
    <P>Conditions have been so bad in recent weeks that pupils have been advised to bring a change of clothes to school because their playground is now a waterlogged field. Asking parents to supply their children with two outfits every day is bad enough, but not providing them with changing or washing facilities is verging on criminal. Where does the Minister of State expect the children to change out of their wet clothes or wash themselves, which they should not have to do in the first place?</P>
    <P>I thought the hedge schools were a thing of the past, but they are alive and well in Rathmore. The Book of Estimates published last week provides no extra funding for school buildings. Just as Nero fiddled while Rome burned, the Minister fiddles while our schools go to ground.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder if we are living in the First World or the Third World. There is no sense of moral rectitude or outrage in this Administration. Is the Government happy with my constituents in Rathmore sending their children to school with a spare set of clothes? Is the Minister happy that Rathmore national school does not actually exist, but rather is based in three run-down prefabricated buildings in the middle of a building site? If this was an industrial building site, it would be closed down in the morning.</P>
    <P>The area around the prefabricated buildings is very dangerous for young children. It is located in the backyard of a senior Minister and a prominent pro-Government Independent Member, who call themselves the saviours of south Kerry. They are obviously very happy to have children in school with no toilets in prefabricated buildings, inadequate heating facilities and a play area like the Bog of Allen.</P>
    <P>The parents, pupils and staff of Rathmore national school have had enough. They will not forget the shoddy treatment they have received from the Government. They know they were not neglected when my party was in power, in comparison to the way they have been fobbed off by the Government. They have had promises and promises from my constituency colleagues, and the Government. Like so many other promises, they proved to be empty.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and his colleagues have a few months left in which to rectify this appalling situation. I want answers tonight and if I do not get them, I will continue to seek them until such time that the pupils of Rathmore get the response they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the new amalgamated national school at Rathmore, County Kerry. The management authorities of Rathmore boys' national school applied to the Department of Education and Science for funding towards upgrading and refurbishing the existing facilities. A technical inspection of the school building was subsequently carried out by the Department's <Col N="1040" /> architectural service. Following further consideration of the matter, the question of rationalisation of primary schools in the Rathmore area was then raised and discussions were held between the Department of Education and Science and the various interested parties.</P>
      <P>Agreement was subsequently reached between the Department and the relevant school authorities to amalgamate into a new school on a greenfield site. As an interim measure, the Department of Education and Science has approved grant aid for the demolition of the old boys' school and also for the provision of temporary accommodation for three classrooms.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by the Government to the building programme at all levels.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now almost six years since the board of management of St. James's national school, Durrus &ndash; a Church of Ireland school &ndash; made its application for a new school to the Department of Education and Science. It furnished plans to the Department in this regard. The site was available for a price of £20,000 almost five years ago. However, the Department and the Office of Public Works dragged their feet in purchasing it. In the meantime the price has increased from £20,000 to £100,000. With the escalation of property prices in the past five years, this should not have happened. The Department and the Office of Public Works have still not completed the purchase, but are now in the final stages of doing so. However, the site will cost £100,000. It could have been purchased for £20,000 five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works insisted on a resubmission of plans for the new school. The plans are now submitted, but the board in charge of the <Col N="1041" /> school does not yet own the site. Sheer incompetence on the part of the Department is responsible for this charade. The real losers in this debacle are the 27 schoolchildren accommodated in a substandard school, in zero temperatures, with little or no heating. By the standards required of national schools, it is completely substandard.</P>
    <P>The school has only a poor electric heating system, with dehumidifiers in operation all the time. The toilets are obsolete. The special needs teacher has to conduct her class in the girls' toilet. This is an outrageous state of affairs which would not be tolerated in any Third World country, never mind this one, which we were told was awash with money 12 months ago. The roof over the toilet is infested with bees with the result that the weight of honey could cause it to collapse. The windows of the entire school are rotten. The doors are equally as bad.</P>
    <P>I understand the plans for a new school have now been submitted to the Department. In view of this and the fact that it is now six years since the first application was submitted on behalf of the school in Durrus, I want immediate action from the Minister on behalf of the school's board of management. The Government stated after last year's budget that the country was awash with money. If so, why did the Department not proceed with the building of the new school during the past year? Will the Minister of State assure me that finance will be provided under the building programme of the Department in 2002? </P>
    <P>I understand that when the board of management contacted the Department's primary building section recently an official indicated that all projects in the Department were on hold until after the budget. Despite St. James's national school, Durrus, having waited almost six years, it is now being informed that no priority will be given to it. It is amazing to think that that kind of answer could be given by an official in the Department. The time for nonsense has come to a halt. This is a serious situation appertaining to that country school. I guarantee the Minister that if the health authorities knew of the serious situation appertaining to that school, they would close it down immediately. I want action, not pious words on this matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the building project for St. James' national school, Durrus, which has been described very vividly by Deputy Sheehan.</P>
      <P>At present the school has a staffing level of principal, one assistant teacher and a shared learning support teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 27 pupils.

The Deputy will appreciate that massive and unprecedented funding has been given over to the building programme in the current year &ndash; £370.5 million. </P>

Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including a project at St. James' national school, Durrus, which is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House. The Gheel Autism Services, formerly the Gheel Training Group, was established in 1971 by parents of people with autism and was registered as a limited company with charitable status in 1974. The Gheel Autism Services provides day care, residential and respite services to adults on the autistic spectrum ranging from those with high functioning autism to those with a low to moderate degree of learning disability. The aim of the organisation, Gheel, is to provide a lifelong, caring and developmental service. Gheel recognises that it is critical that the interaction between the trainee and staff should not always be on a planned and formal basis but should also include appropriate spontaneous interactions including aspects of fun and friendship.</P>
      <P>There are two major Gheel facilities in Dublin &ndash; in Fairview and Milltown &ndash; which cater for 56 trainees. In recent years these two facilities have had grave problems in their funding, capital facilities and staffing. I am informed by the families and friends of Gheel that at least £1.8 million is needed to try to remedy this situation. There is a waiting list of young people on the autistic spectrum who want to avail of the Gheel services. The families and friends of Gheel, under the chairmanship of Helen O'Connell, decided at a recent meeting to pass a motion stating that the families and friends of Gheel demand that funding and staff be provided to establish a comprehensive education and training programme for the trainees at the Gheel Autism Services. At present the majority of people being cared for at Gheel are not receiving any training, either academic or vocational. I am told part of the reason is that many of the trainers, while they are doing their best, are people coming through the community employment programme of FÁS. The parents and friends of Gheel believe the trainees are being denied the opportunity to develop skills in such areas as woodworking, horticulture, computers, pottery and crafts and social interaction to name but a few possibilities. These citizens should have an education and training appropriate to their needs. It is most distressing to observe the regression and lack of progress in many of the young people and trainees. There is also anxiety among the parents and friends of Gheel that there is no system whereby they can be represented on the boards of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> A few weeks ago my colleague, Deputy Shortall, raised the question of provision for children and adults on the autistic spectrum with the Minister in a parliamentary question. The Minister replied to Deputy Shortall that the issue of education and training services for persons with autism over 18 years is among the matters which have been considered by the special task force on autism. The Minister of State may refer to this again tonight. If this is the case, will there be an opportunity this night two weeks following the budget, to bring in specific proposals to deal with the huge gaps in the provision of services for people with autism throughout the country? Recently there was a controversy about other parliamentary questions to the Minister for Education and Science when he over estimated by a factor of ten, the amount of money being given to a project for applied behavioural analysis. It is understandable that these parents and guardians of children and adults get so frustrated when they see a great deal of hype and PR about resources which are not there.</P>
    <P>In the context of the new health strategy, there is a major opportunity to look at the area of provision of these services. Not only in Dublin but throughout the country &ndash; in areas like Kerry, for example &ndash; there are lengthy waiting lists of people who have this condition. Since Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger published their first papers identifying autistic children in 1943, a great deal of research on the best methods of education for children on the autistic spectrum has been carried out. It all focuses on early intervention, intensive resources and personnel, intensive emphasis on visual education and realistic training, particularly in relation to real objects. In that context, the provision of trained personnel and good education facilities is the key to the education of these citizens with autism.</P>
    <P>It is an area of education and training in which, unfortunately, the Department of Health and Children and the Department Education and Science have failed. In my representations on behalf of Gheel in recent months, I have noticed that the two Departments seem to throw the issue around like a hot potato and pass it back and forth to the health board. This happens in other parts of the country as well. I ask the Minister of State and his colleagues to take responsibility for this area. In two weeks time, they have an opportunity to come up with the £2 million needed to provide the necessary resources for citizens in Dublin and elsewhere who suffer on the autistic spectrum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue. Additional revenue funding amounting to £76.7 million, increasing to £83.7 million in January 2001, has been provided by this Government since 2000 for the development of services for persons with autism and <Col N="1044" /> those with an intellectual disability. This funding has provided a range of residential, respite and day services, together with enhanced levels of other health related support services.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding amounting to £27.88 million has been provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority since 2000 for the development of services for persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability. Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with autism in the Dublin area rests in the first instance with the authority.</P>
      <P>With reference to Gheel Services, I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that arrangements are currently being made to undertake a review of these services. Gheel Services provides a range of services for adults with autism, including residential, day and respite services. Additional funding was provided to this agency for the development of new residential services this year.</P>
      <P>One of the areas which I understand is of concern to the Gheel Services is access to and availability of support services such as occupational and speech and language therapy. Many health board and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting the necessary professionals required to deliver these support services. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>In response to his concern regarding the severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, the Minister commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists. The study, a comprehensive assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in these areas up to 2015, was published in July 2001. The Minister is now working with the Minister for Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to increase the number in training for these professions in line with the needs identified in the report.</P>
      <P>The Department is also undertaking a number of initiatives regarding the career structures, workload, working practices and skill mix issues for the groups identified in the report of the expert group on various health professionals. These measures, together with continued investment in services, will greatly assist in delivering an enhanced level of support in these areas to persons with autism and their families.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the continued development of services for persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability and working with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Gheel Services to bring about an enhanced level of support for those availing of these services.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 November 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the views of the chairman of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund, Mr. Orri Vigfusson, regarding commercial drift net fishery for salmon. The North Atlantic Salmon Fund is an Icelandic-based voluntary organisation, mainly financed by private donations from individuals and groups. As a lobby group, NASF works to conserve and restore North Atlantic salmon stocks by focusing in particular on voluntary quota buy-outs with commercial salmon fishermen through a mix of public and private funding.</P>
      <P>The fund has periodically brokered annual compensation agreements with Greenland, Faroes and Icelandic salmon fishermen with mixed results. It is lobbying for the closure and buy-out of commercial salmon net fishing in Ireland with matching public funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been discussions at ministerial and departmental level with Mr. Vigfusson who is campaigning intensively for a voluntary compensation scheme for the entire Irish commercial salmon sector. He has been advised of our current salmon conservation strategies including the significant restrictions in place since 1996 on the commercial salmon sector, the ongoing work of the National Salmon Commission and Government support for developing pilot set aside <Col N="1046" /> schemes in individual catchments. Mr Vigfusson is clearly convinced that the key to restoring salmon stocks lies in ending the commercial exploitation of salmon through voluntary buy-out. He is entitled to his view but the reality is that international experience has been mixed and there are many factors including pollution and climate change which are having profoundly negative impacts on salmon stocks. Regrettably, Mr. Vigfusson's campaign has led to excessive raising of expectation around the coast about large amounts of compensation. The debate on future strategies for the Irish salmon resource has been clouded and confused as a result. There is no question of a bonanza on the cards, nor is it clear that a national buy-out scheme would be cost effective or deliver real results. We need to focus on the shared objective of restoring salmon stocks through effective conservation and management strategies which respect the interests of all legitimate players in salmon.</P>
    <P>In that context, additional conservation measures will be put in place for 2002 and my Department is working intensively with the Salmon Commission and the regional fishery boards to finalise proposals informed by results of the tagging programme this year. Neither the angling nor the commercial sector can be relieved of its obligation to reduce catches of salmon stocks at risk.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides 84.35 million, £66.43 million, for capital investment in fishery harbours infrastructure and facilities. This funding envelope represents a major increase over all previous programmes and is supporting crucial investment in safe, modern and efficient infrastructure which is essential for the fishing and aquaculture industries. While funding has been directed primarily towards key strategic fishery harbours, including Killybegs, Rossaveel and Castletownbere, we are also investing in smaller harbours and landing places right around the coast to meet the needs of local fishing and aquaculture interests and coastal communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is intended to proceed on a planned basis over the period 2000-06. A substantial programme of capital works has already been undertaken. The Estimates allocation of 14.176 million, £11.16, for fishery harbour development is substantial but nonetheless reflects the dramatic change in the economic environment. The Minister and I have made the case for additional <Col N="1047" /> resources particularly for capital investment and critical priorities for our Department including the fishery harbour programme will be decided in terms of the overall budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>The World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Doha last week culminated in a comprehensive declaration by participating Ministers setting the way forward for negotiations. This declaration provides for the undertaking of a detailed work programme, including the area of fisheries.</P>
      <P>Ireland endorses the key underlying principles and objectives involved in international trade generally which were reaffirmed in Doha. These include, in particular, the major role for international trade in the promotion of economic development, the alleviation of poverty and in addressing the vulnerabilities which the least developed countries face in the increasingly global economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fish and fish products fall into the category of non-agricultural products. The Doha declaration <Col N="1048" /> commits the parties to begin negotiations on market access for these products. I understand that product coverage is to be comprehensive and without <i>a priori</i> exclusions. Clearly, there will be variations and different circumstances applying to different products bid overall. It has been agreed that the negotiations for all non-agricultural products should aim to reduce or, as appropriate, eliminate tariffs, in particular on products of export interest to developing countries. It is envisaged that the negotiations will also take fully into account the special needs and interests of developing and least-developed countries.</P>
    <P>It is premature to predict how the negotiations with developing and least developed countries will evolve but Ireland is positively disposed to trade liberalisation with these countries and we will pursue this agenda in all appropriate fora. It is the case of course that the market for fish and fish products is organised on an EU-wide basis and any changes will be considered in an EU context and not solely from a national perspective.</P>
    <P>The development classification of countries is undertaken periodically by the United Nations. The WTO uses the UN classification system and it would be inappropriate for me to comment or adjudicate on the classifications.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The general direction for marine tourism development for the next six years is set in the national development plan. Under the NDP, £20 million has been allocated to the marine tourism sector for the period 2000 to 2006. My Department has been charged with developing and putting in place a cohesive and administratively efficient marine tourism grant scheme to support a range of quality and broad based projects. The objective of the scheme is to support the development of the marine tourism sector by improving quality and capacity in a sustainable way. Specific targets are access infrastructure, such as marinas, berths and slipways, and integrated development and co-operative partnerships, particularly in relation to networks and clusters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> The marine tourism grant scheme is one of five sub-measures of the overall tourism measure of the national development plan and is being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation which has responsibility for the implementation of the overall measure. The scheme will be part of the two regional operational programmes. Funding of £14 million has been allocated to the Border, midlands and western region and £6 million to the south and east region.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, recently informed the House that the necessary State aid approval has been received from the European Commission in connection with the overall NDP tourism measure and that he hopes to launch this measure formally in the near future.

The programme is targeting serious and urgent cases of coastal erosion on a value for money basis through prioritised multi-annual programmes in consultation with local authorities. The coastal protection programme is being underpinned by a new research and development programme which will inform the national coast protection strategy up to 2015.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Depu<Col N="1051" /> ty's question on 8 February last, the decision on whether to proceed with the application in question, which will have to be accompanied by a new environmental impact statement, lies with Dublin Port Company. No such EIS has as yet been submitted to my Department. The stages of the public consultation process are outlined in my previous reply.</P>
      <P>The assessment process would entail detailed consideration of the application by the Department's marine survey office, sea fisheries officers and other relevant divisions as well as the marine licence vetting committee, MLVC. This is a group comprising scientific and technical experts which advises on foreshore lease, licence and permission applications. Copies of the new EIS, when published, would be forwarded to the MLVC and to all groups who made objections to the previous proposal under the public consultation process at that time. My Department would also, as before, engage an independent firm of consultants to review the new EIS.</P>

      <P>The Foreshore Acts, 1933 to 1998, contain provisions to control the removal or disturbance of beach material. For example, to lawfully remove or disturb such material on State-owned foreshore, a person would require to be licensed under the Foreshore Acts which are administered by my Department. Development above the high watermark, including sand and gravel extraction, requires planning permission from the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>Anyone who is concerned about the removal or disturbance of beach material in any area should immediately alert my Department or the relevant local authority, giving as much detailed information as is available, so that the matter may be promptly investigated and necessary action taken.

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 11 October 2001, the arrangements in relation to the management of the mackerel quota have been in place for many years. These arrangements set individual catch limits for the 23 vessels in the dedicated pelagic segment of the Irish fleet which developed the Irish mackerel fishery over a number of decades.</P>
      <P>The vessels outside of the pelagic segment have traditionally caught comparatively small amounts of the stock, normally less than 1,000 tonnes. In light of the developments in the fleet, I have recently reviewed the mackerel arrangements in conjunction with the industry. To reflect the changes in the fleet and to balance the interests of all parties in this fishery, I have decided to allocate 7,000 tonnes of quota mackerel to the vessels in the polyvalent segment of the fleet.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a high level review of the State commercial ports operating under the Harbours Act, 1996 to 2000. The review will be undertaken by suitably qualified independent consultants. An invitation to tender was placed in the national press on 5 October 2001 and also in the OJEU. The closing date for receipt of tenders is 10 December 2001. It is intended to complete the evaluation process and to award the commission within four weeks of the deadline for the receipt of tenders. The study is expected to take some three months from inception to final report.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference require the appointed consultant to conduct a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the current model for the governance of the State port companies, including the advisability of appointing a ports regulator, having regard to the need to have in place structures and approaches which ensure that the ports are incentivised to deliver high quality port products to stakeholders, particularly users; that the ports have access to appropriate funding to provide for capacity requirements in the medium to long-term; that appropriate competitive conditions exist within and between ports, which exert downward pressure on costs and charges for port, shipping and other port related services; the avoidance of inefficient monopolies developing, with potential upward pressure on costs and charges; and that the shareholder-management relationship is conducive to the development of a port sector which is fully supportive of the needs of our rapidly developing open economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The consultants will, on foot of the evaluation, be required to advise on the future role of ports in contributing to the optimum development of the transport sector in Ireland and appraise-recommend management-ownership options, including enhanced private sector involvement. As is standard practice, the consultants will engage in a wide-ranging public consultation process and invite comments, submissions and representations from interested parties.</P>

      <P>Included among the questions and issues being addressed by the task force which would impact on container traffic from Dublin Port through the city centre is the potential to transfer non-essential activities such as fuel storage and empty containers out of the port to a more peripheral location.</P>
      <P>While not pre-empting the task force findings in any way, I have already taken an initiative recently in this regard. It is essential that a container/storage facility is established for Dublin Port traffic on the periphery of the city close to the M50, connected to Dublin Port preferably by rail with an operational capacity to work off-schedule. I have recently charged Dublin Port company with responsibility to progress this initiative, either alone or in partnership with the private sector. The aim is to cut down on gridlock and deliver much needed time savings for all traffic. National policy in connection with rail transport is a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

      <P>In April of this year Ramco Oil and Gas Limited, with its partners, was granted the Seven Heads Gas lease undertaking over the <Col N="1054" /> shallower, gas-bearing interval of the Seven Heads structure.</P>
      <P>As with all lease undertakings, Ramco had carried out a detailed assessment of the Seven Heads structure and had concluded that, based on subsea development technology and the presence nearby of infrastructure and a market, there was the potential for a commercial gas accumulation, but further appraisal work was needed before commerciality could be ascertained. The appraisal well drilled this year &ndash; 48/24-5A &ndash; was an obligation under the broad work programme agreed with my Department which is designed to acquire the data necessary to establish commerciality.</P>
      <P>Drilling of the well commenced on 2 August last and reached its planned total depth on 11 September. Having encountered gas bearing intervals broadly as expected, a multi-phased test programme was undertaken between 21 September and 15 October. The drilling rig left the location on 28 October. My Department receives full information and data on all exploration and appraisal wells drilled offshore and the Ramco well is no exception. For well 48/24-5A, daily reports, a full set of basic log, sample and test data and nearly all processed data have already been received, and outstanding processed data will be lodged as soon as processing is complete. My officials have already completed initial technical evaluations of the well data, but more specialised technical evaluation is being undertaken. The Deputy will appreciate that any such data and conclusions drawn from them are commercially sensitive and subject to the confidentiality clause of the licensing terms. The next step for my Department is to reach agreement with the Ramco group on how the necessary appraisal programme will be continued next year to complete these evaluations and establish whether Seven Heads can be developed commercially.</P>

    <P>I have stated that I accept the commission's recommendation for a bag limit of one fish per angler per day prior to 1 June.

      <P>The Marine Institute and the international scientific bodies have recently finalised the annual assessments of the current status of EU fish stocks. On the basis of this advice, there is a serious concern that many stocks appear to be outside biological limits. There is particular concern about key whitefish stocks such as cod and hake and some of the herring stocks which also appear to be in decline.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, with the support of Ireland, has put in place emergency stock recovery plans for Irish Sea cod, northern hake and cod on the north-west coast. It is too early to evaluate the results of these new initiatives, and discussions have recently commenced in Brussels on the appropriate follow-up to these emergency measures. Ireland has been a leading advocate of stock recovery programmes.</P>
      <P>The strategies for stock recovery and sustainable fishing are being debated in the context of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy. That debate will intensify in the coming year. Technical conservation measures have an important role to play and I will continue to press for effective new technical conservation measures designed to deliver stock recovery and sustainable fishing opportunities for the future.</P>

      <P>The Government's forestry policy as set out in Growing for the Future &ndash; A Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland, is to increase Ireland's forest cover from its current level of 9% of land area to 17% by 2030. This strategy is to be achieved by planting approximately 20,000 hectares of forestry per annum. The planting programme is supported by a generous grants and premium package co-financed by the European Union.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to the achievement of a 30% broadleaf planting target by 2006. However it is a question of the right tree in the right place. My Department's guidelines to the industry underline that soil and site as well as species determine the rate of forest growth and, consequently, the potential for carbon storage. There is also a positive bias in favour of broadleaves in that they attract higher rates under the current grants-premium package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projected significant increase in afforestation will assist in countering the increase in greenhouse gases. Forestry is the only economic activity that can contribute to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Conifers are particularly well suited in this regard. These species play a <Col N="1057" /> significant role as a carbon sequestrator. It is estimated that on average one hectare of Sitka Spruce absorbs 3.3 tonnes of carbon per year while broadleaves absorb 1.3 tonnes per year. Over its rotation one hectare of conifers will remove approximately 100 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere, making conifers exceptionally efficient in combating the greenhouse gas effect.</P>
    <P>The national climate change strategy identifies the key role to be played by forestry in carbon sequestration. COFORD, the Council for Forest Research and Development, is carrying out extensive work in the area of carbon sequestration with a view to maximising the sequestration potential of Irish forests.</P>

The lower reaches of the Castlebar river are badly polluted and support very poor stocks of salmonids relative to other clean channels in the Moy catchment; the phosphorous load from the Castlebar River has created eutrophic conditions <Col N="1058" /> in Lough Cullin periodically and is probably contributing to the eutrophication problem in Lough Conn; and the decline of Lough Cullin as a trout angling fishery is both directly and indirectly related to the polluted nature of the Castlebar River.</P>

      <P>An Alouette 111 single engined helicopter is based at Waterford. This aircraft, because of its restriction to visual contact flight conditions &ndash; daylight only &ndash; and its restricted range, is not particularly suited for offshore marine emergency helicopter cover. It is, however, well suited for mountain, cliff and close in marine search and rescue operations conducted by daylight in visual contact flight conditions. As the Deputy will be aware, the Alouette is in replacement on a temporary basis of the Dauphin which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen.</P>
      <P>Arising from an interim measure agreed by the joint Department of the Marine and Natural Resources-Department of Defence working group, a public contract notice has been published in the EU journal for a contract 24-hour, all weather helicopter service to be provided at Waterford starting in July 2002 or sooner. Companies meeting the qualifying criteria have been invited to tender. The tender evaluation process is in progress and will be completed by the end of 2001. Negotiations are continuing with the existing service provider at Shannon with a view to introducing an improved interim service at Waterford early in 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that my attention has been drawn by the International Transport Workers' Federation to its concerns about the treatment of crews on vessels operating under flags of convenience. The position on the points raised by the federation has been spelt out in replies to various parliamentary questions and in an Adjournment Debate statement on 3 October last. In summary, I have noted the points raised by the International Transport Workers' Feder<Col N="1060" /> ation and I have responsibilities in relation to the Irish Ship Register &ndash; the operation of other ship registers is governed by applicable national and international law.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, all merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are more than 140 ship registers in operation world-wide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state. Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the Marine Survey Office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port-State control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation and, in relation to seafarers' social conditions, by the International Labour Organisation's maritime conventions. Deficiencies identified, including those in relation to seafarers' working and living conditions, are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration and may have to be rectified before the ship continues its journey.</P>
      <P>The Commission and the member states are increasingly concerning themselves with maritime transport issues. In that context there is growing appreciation that the question of social conditions on board ships is an essential component of maritime transport safety. In that regard, two recent EU directives are of particular relevance.</P>
      <P>Council Directive 1999/63/EC on the Organisation of Working Time for Seafarers is the EU formalisation of an agreement reached between the Federation of Transport Workers Union and the European Community Shipowners' Association. Council Directive 1999/95/EC covers the enforcement by means of inspections of provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work on board ships calling at community ports. Both directives will be effective by 30 June 2002. My Department is engaged in discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the modalities for implementing the directives. The operation and enforcement of these directives, when fully implemented, will go a considerable way towards addressing concerns in relation to crewing conditions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a thorough examination of the Final Report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into Accident DH 248/Rescue 111 Tramore, 2 July 1999, took place in my Department. All safety recommendations have been implemented by my Department with the exception of a service level agreement between my Department and the Air Corps of the Department of Defence. The report recommended that a formal service level agreement be put in place between the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard defining the precise responsibilities and deliverables of both parties.</P>
      <P>My Department fully recognises the need for formalising current operational relationships and work is ongoing on the development of a draft agreement. Finalisation of the formal service level agreement awaits the outcome of the Department of Defence contract for helicopter procurement and the finalisation of the report of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources-Department of Defence working group on dedicated marine emergency response helicopters. In the meantime, an informal operational understanding is in place between the Coast Guard and the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>There are some concerns as regards the state of herring stocks generally in Ireland's <Col N="1066" /> EEZ. As regards the Celtic Sea in particular, assessments of this stock in 1998, 1999 and 2000 indicated that there were no serious concerns about the stock, but a more recent assessment gave dramatically different results, suggesting that the stock has declined significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>As the recent assessment was considered by the scientists to be somewhat uncertain, a scientific survey was undertaken over the summer months to help clarify the status of the stock. The results of this survey are being analysed and I understand they will be available in the early part of 2002.</P>
      <P>In so far as a share of the catch is concerned, these have been determined based on historical participation patterns and vary from area to area. In relation to the Celtic Sea herring stock in particular, Ireland is by far the principal quota holder where the percentage share is 86%.</P>

      <P>The prolonged process of finalising the operational programmes and programme complements, the impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis and delays in EU state aid clearance have impacted on the roll-out of a number of NDP measures. However, significant progress on a range of marine and natural resources programmes has already been made and all measures will be up and running in 2002.</P>
      <P>Investment to the end of this year under the £720 million, 914 million, forestry programme will be of the order of £140 million, 178 million. This investment is supporting planting, the improvement of existing woodlands, the development of urban and amenity woodlands, the re-establishment of forest plantations and the enhancement in general of forest infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than £338 million, 430 million, is being invested in the seafood sector over the period of the plan. Investment will support the continued modernisation of the whitefish and inshore fish<Col N="1067" /> ing fleets, restructuring and diversification, seafood marketing and promotion initiatives, seafood training, seafood processing, the development of the aquaculture industry and improvement of fishery harbour infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The first tranche of approved investment under the £57 million, 73 million, aquaculture programme was announced recently while by the end of this year almost £30 million, 38 million, will have been invested in our fishery harbour infrastructure out of a total planned investment of £66 million, 84 million. By the end of this year, £13 million, 16.38 million, of a planned investment of £42 million, 52.9 million, under the coastal protection programme will have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The £42 million, 53 million, investment programme in marine RTDI is well under way and will deliver next year a new state-of-the art research vessel at a cost of almost £25 million, 32 million.</P>
    <P>A total of £61 million, 77 million, has been provided in the national development plan in respect of marine and angling tourism. Following a recent EU state aid approval for the NDP tourism measure generally and with specific state aid approval for the angling measures expected shortly, these programmes will be launched shortly.</P>
    <P>I also expect to announce shortly the first tranche of investment under the £121 million, 153 million, seaports programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority focus in respect of the coastal zone in recent years has been on the introduction of new legislation and frameworks in relation,<i> inter alia</i>, to planning and development, aquaculture licensing and regulation frameworks and dumping at sea parameters, and on locally-based initiatives, including the Bantry Bay coastal zone charter and co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems, CLAMS. The key objective now is the development of new frameworks to address interactions between sectors, agencies <Col N="1068" /> and legal frameworks which will deliver a more integrated approach to coastal zone management.</P>
    <P>The articulation of an integrated coastal zone management strategy and legislative framework will be taken forward in co-operation with all the relevant Departments and agencies, including the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The strategic framework will be informed by national and international ICZM research and experience to date and will take account of the EU recommendation on the implementation of ICZM, agreed by the Council of Environment Ministers in October 2001. In so far as my Department's responsibilities are concerned, the intention is to bring forward legislative proposals next year. In that context my Department intends early in the new year to assign specific responsibility at Assistant Secretary level for organisational change and integrated coastal management policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the National Standards Authority of Ireland that the applicable standard for intruder alarm systems in Ireland is I.S. 199:1987. This standard specifies that the sound level of audible alarms shall be subject to agreement between the subscriber and the installer, but that the sound level shall not be less than 70 dBA when measured at a distance of three metres. This standard also specifies that an audible alarm shall have a minimum duration of 15 minutes and a maximum duration of 30 minutes, and the alarm is required to cease automatically after the maximum duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also understand from the NSAI that I.S. 199 will, in time, be replaced by the European standard EN 50131 which is a multi-part standard. The first part of EN 50131, which covers general requirements, has been published and adopted as Irish standard, I.S. EN 50131-1:1997, and provides an alternative to which the industry is moving. In this respect, the philosophy has been influenced <Col N="1071" /> by practice in several continental European countries where more powerful alarms operate for a shorter maximum period. The audible output of the alarm is the subject of another part of the standard which is still in draft form, but is expected to entail a minimum output somewhat greater than that of I.S. 199. However, I.S. 199 will not be replaced until after all parts of EN 50131 have been adopted.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the standards are voluntary instruments, except for monitored installations, where the Garda Síochána requires certification before a unique reference number is issued. It is estimated that a significant proportion of alarm installations are not certified or even compliant with the standard, and that these continue to be installed for standalone bell only systems, that is, alarms not connected to a monitoring centre.</P>
    <P>However, I understand that the NSAI certification scheme has been instrumental in encouraging installers to seek registration and in ensuring they comply with the standards. The NSAI certification scheme, coupled with the availability of improved equipment, is tending to reduce the number of systems being installed which do not meet the criteria in the standards for maximum duration of audible alarms. I also acknowledge the support of the relevant industry associations, the insurance industry and the Garda which has been vital in promoting the certification scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 11 October 2001, the centrepiece of the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg last June was a substantive debate on the Commission's Green Paper on future directions for the Common Fisheries Policy. The Green Paper was published in March 2001 and has been the subject of widespread consultation with stakeholders. Ireland's national strategy review group on the CFP has commented in detail on the Commission's Green Paper and I endorsed the published views of the strategy group in that regard.</P>
      <P>At the June Council I welcomed the fact that the Commission's thinking reflected a number of Ireland's priorities, including sustainable development, the need to strengthen conservation policy, to secure a level playing field in enforcement and also to improve governance within the CFP.</P>
      <P>In line with the position of the strategy group, I believe that the CFP must be better aligned with social, regional and cohesion policies in the interests of coastal communities. The Green Paper focuses on the sustainability of resources, but I and several other EU colleagues insist that the social and economic aspects of sustainable development must also be acknowledged to ensure the viability of the fishing industry. The governance dimension of the CFP must take greater account of the wider objectives of accountability and transparency.</P>
      <P>The issue of access to fishery resources is of course of great importance and in line with the stated position of successive Governments, I have reiterated Ireland's case for a more equitable share of resources. Fleet policy is also of critical importance and I, together with several other ministerial colleagues, am opposed to the Commission's one dimensional approach to fleet over-capacity which looks for across the board cuts. Fleet policy, in addition to ensuring a balance between fishing effort and available resources, must also ensure the operational safety of fishermen and a competitive, economically sustainable fleet.</P>
      <P>With the benefit of the considerable input being made by the strategy review group, I have articulated Ireland's position on these key issues to Commissioner Fischler and Council colleagues. These views, and the views of other member states and the EU fishing sectors are being assessed within the Commission. I expect the Commission to present its formal proposals on CFP reform within the next few months. As I have previously advised the House, substantive negotiations will begin under the Spanish Presidency next year culminating under the Danish Presidency towards the end of 2002. The key challenge for Ireland in the negotiating process is to influence the overall direction of much needed fundamental reform while maximising the national position in terms of our key priorities.</P>

      <P>On 1 July 2001, I introduced new regulations governing the safe use of personal watercraft, jet skis, fast power craft and other mechanically propelled pleasure craft. These are an initial phase of regulations which have been developed by my Department as a result of the recommendations made in the report of the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, which was presented to me in April 2000.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the new regulations implement the recommendations which had been made in relation to the carriage and use of appropriate lifejackets, the minimum age under which persons should not be allowed to operate personal watercraft and fast power craft and restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs. In addition, the regulations provide that persons who operate personal watercraft, jet skis, and fast power craft in a dangerous or careless manner can be prosecuted for such behaviour.</P>
      <P>The ministerial action group made other recommendations relating to issues such as insurance and registration of recreational craft as well as training and competence of users. These issues will now be addressed in greater detail by my Department, in full consultation with those in the sector, in order to design a second phase of legislative provisions which are reasonable and practical and which can be introduced as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to offshore oil and gas exploration, as I mentioned in my reply of 21 March 2001 to a similar question raised by the Deputy, Enterprise Energy Ireland declared the Corrib gas field commercial in January this year on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil and Marathon and sought a lease from me for its development. I can now inform the Deputy that a petroleum lease under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, demising the petroleum in the Corrib gas field to Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited and its partners Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited was granted by me on 15 November 2001. Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expects the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to estimate the commercial value of the Corrib gas find. This will depend on factors such as the size of the field, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of the well, the market price and the cost of development of the field. No new discoveries of oil and gas have been reported to me since my reply of 21 March 2001.</P>
      <P>Exploration for minerals is regulated by prospecting licences issued by me under the Minerals Development Acts. Exploration must identify whether any minerals found can be exploited commercially. That commerciality is demonstrated to me in the first instance by an application for a State mining lease or licence. The actual values fluctuate with costs and the returns from the market.</P>
      <P>The six monthly reports which I lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas under the Minerals Development Acts give details of all extant prospecting licences, State mining licences and State mining leases. In the report for the period to 30 June 2001 the numbers were 432, four and 12 respectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, it is expected that the application will go to the public consultation stage by the end <Col N="1077" /> of this month. The public consultation process is initiated by the placement of a public notice in a newspaper circulating in the area in which the development is proposed. This provides the general public with an opportunity to express their views on the application within the statutory period of one calendar month from the date on which the notice is published.</P>
    <P>When consideration has been given to any comments or objections received, the Department's marine licence vetting committee will make a recommendation in respect of the application. I expect, therefore, that a decision will be reached early in the new year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned at the number of accidents involving mechanical lifting equipment on board fishing vessels. If this type of equipment is not operated correctly it can pose very serious risk of injury or even loss of life. I am aware of a number of serious accidents arising from failure associated with such equipment. The primary responsibility for the maintenance of fishing vessel equipment rests with the skipper-owner. New fishing vessels over 15 metres and existing vessels over 18 metres must comply with the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Fishing Vessels) Regulations, 1999. These regulations give effect to Council Directive 93/103/EEC on the minimum health and safety requirements applicable to work on board fishing vessels. The regulations set out the duties of owners in this regard, including duties in relation to the provision of information, training, instruction and consultation of workers. They view vessel decks as workplaces, recognising the very dangerous nature of work on a fishing vessel deck.</P>
      <P>Under the Fishing Vessels (Certification of Deck Officers and Engineer Officers) Regulations, 1988, fishing vessels with engine power greater than 750 kW are also obliged to carry specified numbers of qualified engineer officers depending on the registered power of the vessel. BIM provides training for those wishing to study for engineer officer certificates of competency, (fishing vessel), class I-class II under these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing vessel safety review group report 1996 did not recommend that vessels less than 750 kW should carry qualified engineer officers but instead recommended that a motorman level basic engineering training for small boat operators below engineering certificate requirements <Col N="1078" /> should be initiated by BIM. For those who do not wish to study for engineer officer certificates of competency, BIM currently offers short basic engineering training modules for new entrants and existing practioners within the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, commercial fishing and aquaculture certificates. These modules are entitled marine engine operations and engineering workshop processes respectively and some basic engineering is also included in the work boat handling module of these FETAC certificates.</P>
    <P>BIM is presently looking at developing a dedicated FETAC modular course for &ldquo;motormen&rdquo; on vessels less than 750 kW and recently employed a consultant in this regard. They will be working closely with both the Marine Survey Office of my Department and the fishing industry to ensure that the course satisfies all requirements as far as possible.</P>

      <P>The requirements regarding the control of the discharge of garbage from ships are set out in the Sea Pollution (Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships) Regulations, 1994. These regulations prohibit the dumping of certain materials entirely and sets out the arrangements for disposal of certain types of garbage, including food waste. They also oblige harbour authorities to provide facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of garbage.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament and Council of Ministers in November 2000 adopted a directive on port waste reception facilities for ship-generated waste. The purpose of the directive is to improve the availability and use of port reception facilities for such waste. It builds on existing international arrangements, principally MARPOL 73/78, the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships). Regulations to give effect to the directive will need to be introduced by December 2002. My Department, conscious of the difficulties caused by foot and mouth disease earlier this year and the importance of adequate arrangements for the control and disposal of food wastes, is in discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in this connection.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question appears to refer to the practice of twin rigging, whereby a trawler simultaneously tows two trawl nets. This practice occurs mainly in the prawn fisheries and is legally permitted under the Common Fisheries Policy. Given that the Irish fleet fishes beside other European fleets in the prawn fisheries it would put our fleet at a significant competitive disadvantage to introduce national legislation to prohibit twin rigging for Irish vessels alone. The Irish fishing industry has not called for the prohibition of twin rigging under the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, in spite of the BIM whitefish fleet quality assurance scheme of December 2000, fishing vessels are still landing over quotas of species and under size fish and that such catches are loaded into lorries for foreign destinations; and the action he intends to take in relation to this matter.</Quest>

      <P>Significant improvement in quality standards for the Irish whitefish catching sector is a key strategic priority for BIM and my Department and is first and foremost in the industry's own commercial interest. Compliance across Europe with CFP conservation regulations, including quota, minimum size standards and gear is essential for the sustainability of fish stocks and the future of the industry itself.</P>
      <P>Checks and controls in ports and at sea are regularly carried out on Irish and foreign vessels by my Department's sea fisheries officers and the Naval Service. The penalties under Irish law for proven non-compliance with fisheries regulations are among the most stringent in the EU.</P>

      <P>The requirements regarding the control of the discharge of oil from ships are set out in the Sea Pollution (Prevention of Oil Pollution) Regulations, 1994. Oil, which cannot <Col N="1080" /> be discharged in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, has to be landed ashore for proper disposal, which can include eventually sending it to recycling facilities. The actions described by the Deputy are not permitted and are not to my Department's knowledge taking place, and I am advised that they would result in oil slicks which would be readily evident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase of the premises and adjoining jetty formerly owned by Mornington Fish Products Limited, in voluntary liquidation, was undertaken to ensure the continuing safe and reliable importation of explosives and the ingredients thereof in commercial volumes. The facility also enables the safe importation of munitions for the Defence Forces. The jetty has been used for many years for the importation of explosives and is licensed for this purpose by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Its particular suitability for this activity is principally attributable to its remoteness from human habitation.</P>
      <P>In 1998, a proposal emerged to sell the facility for a holiday home development. Obviously any housing near the jetty would have rendered it unusable for the importation of explosives. While considerable efforts were made to identify an alternative location, it became apparent that the Mornington facility was the only location currently available which could safely cater for the importation of explosives or munitions in commercial volumes. Accordingly, in order to ensure a regular and safe supply of materials to the manufacturers of explosives, the mining industry and other authorised users of explosives, negotiations were entered into to purchase the jetty and adjoining lands from the liquidator of the company. The purchase is scheduled to be completed at the end of the month. The purchase price agreed is £170,000 and not £350,000, as the Deputy suggests. The Department will consider various potential uses for the adjoining lands which are compatible with the continued importation of explosives and its location within a designated marine SAC.</P>

      <P>Under the British Irish Agreement Act, 1999, responsibility for the development and licensing of aquaculture in Lough Foyle was conferred on the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, FCILC. The necessary legislation to enable the Loughs Agency of the FCILC to exercise its functions in relation to aquaculture is currently being progressed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland and respective legal advisers. Priority is being given to finalising the legislation as soon as practicable. The resulting framework will ensure that aquaculture in Lough Foyle is developed and managed in a fully sustainable way.</P>
      <P>Pending the finalisation of the legislative framework, financial assistance was made available by BIM to a number of operators for exploratory bottom mussel trials in the lough. Assessment of the mussel growing potential of the lough was conditional on mussels being relaid on areas outside of proven oyster growing areas. In three cases where there was subsequently found to be marginal encroachment on to oyster beds no grant aid was paid to the fishermen concerned. A joint evaluation by BIM and the Loughs Agency of the mussel seed trials concluded that, overall, the trials were successful and that encroachment on oyster grounds was not significant.</P>

These standards will be further augmented next year with the implementation of two EU Council directives which deal respectively with the organisation of working time for seafarers and with the enforcement through inspections of provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work on board vessels calling at Community ports. Ireland will continue to support all efforts to enhance working conditions for seafarers on board flags of convenience and all vessels and will continue to enforce safety and operational standards through the port state control framework.</P>

      <P>Dublin Port Company as a statutory independent commercial State company under the Harbours Act, 1996, is wholly responsible for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour. While the day to day management of traffic within the port is undertaken by the port company, such responsibility ends once that traffic is beyond the port gate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I established a task force earlier this year to advise me on transport logistics in connection with ports, including the opportunity to divert traffic to other less congested ports outside Dublin and the prospects for off peak scheduling of traffic. I also requested the task force to identify cost effective options for the movement of traffic through Dublin. Included among the questions and issues being addressed by the task force, which would impact on traffic from Dublin Port through the city centre, is the potential to transfer non-essential activities, such as fuel storage and empty containers, out of the port to a more peripheral location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While not pre-empting the task force findings in any way, I have recently taken an initiative in this regard, looking at the possibility to establish a container-storage facility for Dublin Port traffic on the periphery of the city close to the M50, connected to Dublin Port preferably by rail with an operational capacity to work off-schedule. I have charged Dublin Port Company with the responsibility to deliver this facility, either alone or in partnership with the private sector. The aim is to <Col N="1083" /> cut down on gridlock and deliver much needed time savings for all traffic. I have also requested Dublin Port to collaborate with its shippers to deliver a genuine 24 hour port facility. This could involve,<i> inter alia</i>, enhanced incentives and discount pricing which would contribute to relieving pressure on Dublin peak traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>As the largest port in the State and on the island, the dependence on Dublin Port to handle almost half of the State's commercial freight traffic cannot be understated nor its contribution to the national economy. Dublin Port is doing all it can to encourage operators in the port, shippers and importers &ndash; exporters to further develop flexible round the clock working systems for all operations, including customer collection and delivery. All these issues are being addressed by the task force which expects to report by year's end.</P>

This arose as a direct result of an audit carried out by my Department's internal audit unit. The total cost, inclusive of VAT, of the investigation was £15,125. Given the potential seriousness and urgency of the issue and because of the sensitive nature of the matter it was decided, in consultation with the Government contracts committee, that only one quotation should be sought. In the interest of transparency it was considered more appropriate to engage a company other than the one employed at the time as the Department's accreditation auditors.</P>

      <P>The permit to which the Deputy refers was issued by my Department to Galway Harbour Company for the disposal of 63,800 tonnes of dredged material arising from maintenance dredging of the approach channel to Galway docks, the tidal basin and the lay-by of Galway Harbour. I confirm that Galway Harbour Company met the essential conditions attached to the permit in question, namely, no dredging of material from the starboard side of the commercial dock area and use of the specified site for disposal of dredged material. There were some minor variations in compliance with other conditions which were necessitated by bad weather, tidal conditions, engineering constraints or in the interests of safety. These variations did not have adverse environmental consequences.</P>
      <P>Permits for disposal of dredged material at sea are issued only after an extensive consultation process involving the public and relevant Government agencies, such as Dúchas and the Departments of Public Enterprise, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Environment and Local Government. The Department also consults the marine licence vetting committee, MLVC, an independent panel of experts. No permits are granted unless the MLVC is satisfied that the material is safe to be dredged, that there are no reuse options for the material and that the proposed dump site is suitable. Given the arrangements for public consultation and expert evaluation of proposals, including examination of submissions or observations in relation thereto, a provision for appeals does not seem to be warranted. My Department promptly investigates any complaint about permitted operations which is brought to its attention.</P>

I have asked my officials to compile this information in so far as this is possible given the range of programmes and the number of agencies involved. I will arrange for this information to be supplied directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>There have been no economic finds of gold, silver or precious ores in the past ten years. Gold is known to occur in the rocks in many parts of Ireland and there is a continuing interest in exploring for it. It is the sole target of four current prospecting licences and incidental <Col N="1088" /> target of over 130 more of the 432 such licences which were extant at end June 2001. Silver is normally found in Ireland as part of the suite of base metal ores and so it is an incidental target of almost 400 licences. There is also a minor interest in exploring for other high value metals and for diamond and other gemstones.</P>

BIM's training programmes for the sector are supporting and encouraging new entrants as well as providing ongoing training for existing players. Comprehensive investment and development strategies for the seafood sector going forward have been clearly set out under the national development plan and are being progressed under a number of operational programmes. I am forwarding to the Deputy our publication which details the measures relating to marine and natural resources under the NDP which includes all measures in place to develop the seafood sector.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to recent letters from the Commission in relation to Ireland's position under the multiannual guidance programme and the registration of a specific fishing vessel. The issues in question continue to be the subject of high level discussions with the Commission with a view to resolving outstanding issues.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the United Nations' analysis which states that poor countries lose around 20 billion dollars a year due to an inability to export their food products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29159/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>In his report to the UN Millennium Summit, in September 2000, the UN Secretary General pointed out that &ldquo;global economic losses from agricultural protectionism may be as high as $150 billion per year &ndash; about $20 billion of it in lost exports for developing countries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU has given an international lead in market access for the least developed countries <Col N="1107" /> through its so-called Everything But Arms initiative which was adopted by the Council in February 2001. This initiative opens the EU market, duty and quota free, to all exports, except armaments, from the 49 least developed countries. Under the initiative these countries will be able to export their food products to the EU market. The initiative came into effect immediately with the exception of transition periods for bananas, rice and sugar. For these three commodities, the EU market will be progressively opened with complete access for bananas by 2006 and for rice and sugar by 2009. The EU is the only trading bloc to offer such complete market access for the LDCs and is urging the US, Japan and others to follow suit.</P>
    <P>The WTO rules governing market access for agricultural goods were discussed in the new global round of trade negotiations launched at the WTO Ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar on 9-13 November. The Ministerial Declaration, adopted at Doha states,<i> inter alia</i>, in the section on agriculture: &ldquo;building on the work carried out to date and without prejudicing the outcome of the negotiations,&rdquo;  we commit ourselves to comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access.</P>
    <P>Market access is one of a number of factors inhibiting developing country food exports. Many poor countries lack the trade capacity necessary to avail of the export opportunities which exist under current agreements. Trade capacity building in such areas as negotiating skills, implementing WTO agreements, port and customs reform, and trade promotion is required. Ireland Aid has tripled its support for such trade capacity building over the past three years. Together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Development, we contribute $2.25 million, over five years, to the Advisory Centre on WTO Law, which helps developing countries to take cases at the WTO under its dispute settlement mechanism. We contribute $300,000 to the Integrated Framework, an effort by six international agencies &ndash; World Bank, IMF, UNDP, UNCTAD, ITC and WTO &ndash; to help build trade capacity in least developed countries. Ireland Aid also provides funding to the UN Conference on Trade and Development and to the International Trade Centre.</P>
    <P>Many developing countries also face difficulties in complying with the complex provisions of the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement. This agreement determines the rules for setting human, animal and plant health standards for imports. As part of its overall engagement in the area of trade capacity building, Ireland Aid is discussing with the WTO how we might support a WTO programme of capacity building in the implementation of the SPS agreement in least developed countries to ensure that they can obtain maximum advantage from the Everything But Arms initiative.</P>

      <Quest>if he will re-examine the outcome of the 1969 Act of Free Choice in West Papua due to the franchise being limited to 1025 people out of a population of 800,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's involvement in the 1969 Act of Free Choice was limited to a vote on the report of the UN Secretary General's Representative to West Papua at the 24th UN General Assembly. It is not within this Government's power to re-examine the outcome of the Act, which would be a matter for the UN Secretariat and the office of the Secretary General to consider. I am aware of the outstanding questions about the circumstances surrounding the 1969 Act of Free Choice in West Papua &ndash; or Irian Jaya as it is now known &ndash; and the role of the UN in that process. I am concerned about reports that the rights and freedoms of the West Papuan people were restricted at that time, and at current reports of on-going human rights abuses in that province.</P>
      <P>I, along with my EU partners, have raised our concerns about the situation in Irian Jaya with the Indonesian authorities on a number of occasions. Most recently, at the General Affairs Council on 14 May 2001, we called on and encouraged the Indonesian government to make further urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully the various conflicts in Indonesia, including Irian Jaya. We have been closely monitoring the situation in Irian Jaya, particularly since Mrs. Megawati Sukarnoputri became President of Indonesia. Later this year EU Heads of Mission in Jakarta plan to undertake a fact-finding mission to the province to evaluate at first hand the situation there.</P>
      <P>To address the root causes of tension in Irian Jaya, the Government, as well as the EU, supports a forward-looking approach based on dialogue and negotiations between the local population and the authorities in Jakarta.</P>
      <P>At this time, my own contacts indicate that initiating a review of the events of 1969 may not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the West Papuan people. It would be my concern that such a review may indeed prejudice on-going efforts to initiate a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the Government authorities in Jakarta.</P>

      <P>The Government believes that action against terrorism must be pursued resolutely across a wide front and over a sustained period. I have studied with interest Amnesty International's assessment of the challenges facing the international community at this time.</P>
      <P>The international community has mobilised itself in response to the atrocities of 11 September. Those who perpetrated these acts must be brought to justice. Member states of the United Nations are obliged by the terms of Security Council Resolution 1368 to do all in their power to bring this about.</P>
      <P>In framing a response to the events of 11 September, Ireland along with the international community must not relax its efforts in regard to human rights and humanitarian obligations and standards under international law. The indispensable role of the United Nations in tackling common threats and in achieving joint objectives and goals must be asserted and universally recognised in the period ahead. In pursuit of this aim, Ireland looks forward to the imminent establishment of the International Criminal Court, and appeals for its universal recognition.</P>
      <P>Ireland, along with the other member states of the EU opposes the death penalty in all cases and accordingly aims at its universal abolition. The Deputy will be aware of the efforts we have made, in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, to seek its universal abolition.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. Ireland and the other member states of the EU pursue this policy consistently in different international fora such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the preparations for the WTO ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar, 9-13 November 2001, the Department of Foreign Affairs worked to ensure development considerations were fully considered in our national position and in the EU's approach.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs believes a new comprehensive round of global trade negotiations is in the interest of developing countries. The 49 least developed countries have a 0.4% share in global trade and attract less than 1% of global investment flows. From a development perspective, future WTO negotiations on tariffs, market access and trade in services hold out the prospect of increasing the integration of developing countries into the international economy.</P>
      <P>The negotiations at Doha included matters of profound interest to developing countries. The Department of Foreign Affairs co-ordinated closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on such key issues as the WTO's TRIPS Agreement and access to public health, the relationship between TRIPS and the preservation of biodiversity, the handling of labour and environmental issues in the WTO, market access, the burden on developing countries of implementing the Uruguay Round agreements and future funding commitments to support trade capacity building in developing countries.</P>
      <P>An officer from the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs participated in Ireland's official delegation to the WTO Ministerial meeting. Ireland Aid also financially supported the attendance of two Irish development NGOs and the development officer of the ICTU at the Doha meeting.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the ministerial declaration adopted at Doha, which launches a new global round of trade negotiations, represents a good result for developing countries. It will see comprehensive negotiations on issues such as market access, tariffs and services which could see further market liberalisation in sectors where developing countries have significant export advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish delegation at Doha actively supported EU efforts to secure a ministerial declaration which asserted that the TRIPS Agreement contained sufficient flexibility to ensure that poor countries could obtain access to HIV-AIDS medicines at affordable prices through compulsory licensing. The ministerial declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, adopted at Doha, emphasises the rights of WTO members to protect public health and to promote access to medicines for all. The declaration is a major contribution to clarifying the relationship between the international legal framework on patent protection and the need to ensure life saving medicines are available, at affordable prices, to coun<Col N="1111" /> tries suffering from serious crises such as HIV-AIDS, malaria or TB.</P>

      <P>The Rio Earth Summit in 1992 adopted Agenda 21, a global blueprint for sustainable development that has become the basis for much of the globe's national and local planning as well as an essential framework for development cooperation. The Rio meeting also approved global covenants dealing with issues such as climate change, biodiversity and combating desertification which have subsequently given rise to global conventions on these subjects.</P>
      <P>Following signature and subsequent ratification, Ireland became a party to the UNCCD &ndash; UN Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and-or Desertification, particularly in Africa &ndash; in October 1997. Ireland Aid continues to mainstream commitments and obligations under the Convention into Ireland Aid's programme activities in affected priority countries. For example, in the Eastern Tigray region of Ethiopia, we have supported a watershed management approach, integrating soil and water conservation with production-income generation issues in those areas which suffer most severely from desertification and drought. This approach has been highly successful and has simultaneously addressed the problem of land degradation, moisture deficit and food insecurity, providing short-term employment on a cash-for-work basis as well as enhancing the long-term production and income-generating potential of watersheds. We also support activities to combat desertification through our contributions to the core resources of the Global Environmental Facility and other multilateral fora.</P>
      <P>Ireland has participated actively in the various meetings of the conferences of the parties which are signatories to the convention and has made both mandatory and voluntary contributions to the core resources of the UNCCD since 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Working Group on Contemporary forms of slavery estimates that there are currently 27 million persons living in what it defines as conditions of slavery. This is more than twice the number of persons estimated to have been <Col N="1112" /> taken from Africa during the 400-year transatlantic slave trade. Of these, an estimated 20 million are bonded labourers. This means that the number of persons currently living in what are described as conditions of slavery is approximately five times greater that the population of the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &ldquo;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude: slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.&rdquo; Full adherence to the absolute values enshrined in the declaration is of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. We voice our concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and, where the occasion arises, the UN Security Council</P>
      <P>Efforts to eliminate contemporary forms of slavery involve a wide spectrum of international organisations, NGOs and governments. Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation.</P>
      <P>The working group on contemporary forms of slavery, an inter-sessional working group of the sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of all aspects of slavery.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, led the delegation to the 89th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June of this year, where he raised the issue of bonded labour, in the course of the discussion at the plenary session of the conference he put forward a number of practical measures to address this specific problem.</P>
      <P>The protection and promotion of the rights of all human beings is the first responsibility of every Government. The persistence of contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, presents a challenge to all governments. The Government will continue to highlight and address this issue at every appropriate opportunity.</P>

As I pointed out in my reply to that parliamentary question, details of the level of discharges of radioactive waste from the Sellafield plant and radioactive contamination of the Irish marine environment are set out in a series of bi-annual reports published by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &ndash; RPII. The most recent report published by the RPII, covers the period 1998-99.

The legal action which the Irish Government is taking against the UK in regard to the Sellafield MOX plant is an indication of the Government's determination to bring about the cessation of operations at Sellafield.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the proposals made in 1999 by Dr. <Col N="1115" /> Gordon Thompson to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. Dr. Thompson's proposals, described as a nuclear &ldquo;Grand Bargain&rdquo;, essentially suggested that France and Britain would agree to stop reprocessing and, with the involvement of other nations, would initiate a programme of nuclear clean up. Dr. Thompson had suggested that smaller countries not involved, such as Ireland, could play an important role as facilitators of the bargain. Dr. Thompson's proposals were referred to during a debate in the Seanad on 3 March 1999 in connection with a motion on nuclear fuel reprocessing in the course of which I outlined the Government's position. The matter was also the subject of Parliamentary Question No. 14 of 19 May 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government would fully support any suggestion that operations in the nuclear industry, including the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, should cease and that operations should instead concentrate on clean up operations at nuclear installations. However, the approach to be adopted by Ireland needs to be realistic and based on our best assessment of what is likely to be achieved successfully. This includes any diplomatic initiatives we adopt. I would like to refer the Deputy to my contribution to the Seanad debate on the motion referred to above and to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 14 of 19 May 1999 in which I outlined some of the initiatives undertaken by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to avail of every opportunity in the international area, such as at EU meetings, meetings of the International Atomic Energy Agency, of the OECD and of OSPAR to convey its strong opposition to nuclear related activities and to promote an improved safety culture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are details of the most significant items by sector. Since 1997, Exchequer capital investment in public transport was approximately £497 million &ndash; 631 million. A further allocation of £120 million &ndash; 152 million &ndash; will be spent by end 2001. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the expenditure on a county by county basis. However, the DART service improvements carried out between 1997 and 1999 cost approximately £10 million &ndash; 12.7 million &ndash; and by the <Col N="1116" /> end of 2001 approximately £2.5 million &ndash; 3.17 million &ndash; will have been spent on the upgrading of the railway track southwards to Rosslare. Bus Éireann have expended over £0.5 million &ndash; 0.63 million &ndash; on buses to improve the services in the Wicklow area. During summer 2000, additional services introduced on the Dublin-Wicklow route generated an increase of 30% in passenger numbers compared to 1999.</P>
    <P>Over the period in question, my Department allocated £5 million &ndash; 6.35 million &ndash; in grant aid for capital improvement works and upgrades in facilities at the regional airports in Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Knock and Donegal. Of this amount, £1.779 million &ndash; 2.26 million &ndash; remains to be spent in relation to a runway extension at Galway airport, which is expected to be completed in the first half of next year. There was no expenditure in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>My Department, through the Irish Energy Centre, has incurred total capital expenditure of £5.5 million &ndash; 7 million &ndash; on energy efficiency projects from July 1997 to 1 November 2001. Of this total, 2.2% or £120,763 &ndash; 153,337 &ndash; was spent in County Wicklow. Some £2.842 million &ndash; 3.61 million &ndash; was also spent in the period in question under the EIOP renewable energy measure and £350,000 &ndash; 444,500 &ndash; under the INTERREG II programme. No capital expenditure was incurred in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Capital Expenditure on Multimedia Developments amounted to £42.3 million &ndash; 53.71 million. None of this expenditure relates to County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on broadband infrastructure amounted to £7.8 million &ndash; 9.9 million &ndash; of which £290,000 &ndash; 368,224 &ndash; was spent in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The IT unit of my Department's capital expenditure from July 1997 to 1 November 2001 was £2.7 million &ndash; 3.43 million &ndash; of which approximately £3,000 &ndash; 3,809 &ndash; or 11% was spent in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>From July 1997 to 1 November 2001, the Geological Survey Ireland capital expenditure amounted to approximately £3.2 million &ndash; 4.1 million. None of this was directly invested in infrastructure in County Wicklow.</P>

      <P>In September of this year I launched a 21.1 million initiative &ndash; £16.6 million &ndash; entitled the House of Tomorrow programme which offers support for research, development and demonstration projects aimed at generating and applying technologies, products, systems, practices and information leading to more sustainable energy performance in Irish housing. This programme may be of relevance to the Development Association and its proposed development of five energy efficiency-ecological houses and a community green centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre, which is based in Glasnevin in Dublin, implements initiatives on the promotion of energy conservation on behalf of my Department and is implementing the House of Tomorrow programme. The centre has <Col N="1118" /> issued a call for proposals seeking funding for the design and construction of new houses which demonstrate best available energy practice.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest for the association to contact the centre directly for further information. The co-ordinator for the project is Ms Aine Lavelle and she can be contacted at 01-8082086 or e-mail aine.lavelle@irish-energy.ie.

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 21 on 18 October 2001, I have decided to dispose of some land at Gormanston Camp, County Meath, to fund equipment purchases for the Defence Forces.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The animal-based headage schemes have been replaced in 2001 by the area based compensatory allowance scheme. The new scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department has now written to the person named with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on <Col N="1121" /> entitlement to area based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.</P>

      <P>On 31 October, I announced that the 30 day holding period for purchases of susceptible animals was being extended to 31 December 2001. Under this rule, an animal may not be sold or supplied onward within a period of 30 days from the date of purchase unless the buyer has received an exemption which is granted only in particular circumstances and subject to conditions.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the continued absence of new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain since 30 September. However, I still regard it as essential to maintain a precautionary approach in relation to this virulent disease. The need for continued caution is underlined by the fact that, contrary to expectations, outbreaks have occurred in Britain in the past in areas deemed clear of the disease for a considerable period. I considered, therefore, that the extension of the movement controls for a further two months provides an additional safeguard in containment and control measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be reviewing my decision in relation to the 30 day rule at the appropriate time. However, I have said in the past that there are some aspects of Irish agricultural life that may never be the same again. Quite apart from the situation in Great Britain, one of the clear lessons to be learned from the foot and mouth disease episode is the need to address some of the traditional practices in relation to animal movement, for disease control and other reasons. As well as taking on board the foot and mouth situation in Great Britain, and the understandable pressure from the industry in this country, I intend to take all of the experiences of the foot and mouth crisis into account in my consideration of this issue. I will also be discussing this issue with my colleague, <Col N="1122" /> Ms Brid Rodgers, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The person named is due £3,782.50 under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 43.30 hectares of more severely handicapped land at £70 per hectare, and 16.70 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. This compares with his average payment of £3,220 in the three years 1998, 1999 and 2000. Payment will issue before the end of November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House on 23 October last, I have decided to accept the recommendation made to me by the Irish Medicines Board that intramammary antibiotic medicines should be brought under prescription control, thus bringing them into line with other antibiotic veterinary medicines on the Irish market in terms of designated route of supply.</P>
      <P>In accepting the IMB report, I have had due regard to scientific views in the report in relation to antibiotic resistance which, as the Deputy will be aware, is a major issue both in human and animal health terms. I had also to take account, not only of current stated EU policy to the effect that all antibiotic medicines should be subject to veterinary prescription, but also that of major international bodies such as the WHO and the OIE. Aside from the primary concerns about human and animal health, I ask the Deputy to reflect on whether the interests of our export-orientated agriculture and food industries would be best served in the longer term by having an important category of antibiotic treatment subject to a regime of control which is out of line with that in operation in almost every other member state of the EU.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the stance taken by the IMB, it needs to be pointed out that the IMB, in its role as competent authority, could have exercised its power to redesignate intramammaries as &ldquo;prescription only&rdquo;, thus making them subject to the existing legislative requirements. At the same time, the IMB report recognises the difficulties which would arise in applying the current prescription rules in Irish legislation to intramammaries. Accordingly, my Department is now engaged in considering what changes to existing legislation will be necessary in order to have an effective and workable prescription regime applying to intramammaries. In this context, my Department has sought the views and suggestions of stakeholders on the optimum arrangements which might apply. Some stakeholders have already responded, and I expect this process to be completed within the coming weeks. In formulating its proposals, my Department will not alone have regard to the views expressed by stakeholders, within the context of putting in place a suitable prescription regime, but will also have due regard to arrangements in operation in <Col N="1124" /> other member states of the EU where prescription regimes currently apply to intramammaries.</P>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 area aid scheme, an applicant must ensure that only eligible land is included on the area aid application. The person named included one ineligible area in her area aid application, comprising of buildings, trees or other invalid land totalling some 0.28 hectares.</P>
      <P>The herdowner applied for area aid in respect of a total of 19.29 hectares, but after deducting the ineligible land, a valid area of 19.01 hectares has been determined, which is 1.45% less than the area claimed. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%. In this case, therefore, no area aid penalty is applicable, leaving the area determined for payment purposes at 19.01 hectares.</P>
      <P>Payment amounting to £1,211.94 under the 2001 area-based compensatory scheme issued to the person named on 25 September 2001 in respect of 5.46 hectares of more severely handicapped land at £70 per hectare, and 13.83 hectares of less severely handicapped land at £60 per hectare. This compares with her average payment of £1,046.55 in the three years 1998, 1999 and 2000. However, she was due payment on 13.55 hectares of less severely handicapped land at £60 per hectare resulting in an overpayment of £16.80 on the difference of 0.28 hectares. The overpayment will be recouped from future entitlements of the person named.</P>
      <P>Payment of the 80% advance under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, amounting to £1,688.51, 2,143.96, will issue to the person named within the next seven days.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted three applications in respect of a total of 14 animals for special beef premium under the 2001 scheme. Payment of the 80% advance under the 2001 special beef premium scheme amounting to £1,199.52 will issue within the next two weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1128" /> announced on Monday this week the provisional figures of the outcome of the voluntary disclosure scheme for holders of bogus non-resident accounts. The provisional figures indicated that a total of £176 million &ndash; 223.4 million &ndash; was paid by 3,500 account holders in respect of an estimated 6,500 accounts.</P>
      <P>In its statement of practice issued on 2 May 2001, Revenue outlined its intended approach to this issue which involved two distinct stages, the first of which ran to 15 November during which depositors who had bogus accounts could make voluntary disclosure on favourable terms, while during the second, which came into action immediately after 15 November, Revenue would use its new powers to identify account holders who had not availed of the voluntary disclosure route and would pursue full tax, interest and penalties with prosecution in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are making applications to the High Court using their new powers to identify those people who held bogus non-resident accounts and who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure arrangements. In the meantime, Revenue already has information on the identities of a substantial number of account holders obtained in the course of the look back audits of financial institutions. These lists will now be compared with the lists of people who have availed of the voluntary scheme, so as to identify cases in which individual investigations can commence immediately. Defaulters, who will be exposed as a result of the investigations now getting under way, will not be able to avail of the cap on interest and penalties. Their names will be published and appropriate cases will be investigated with a view to prosecution.</P>
      <P>I understand that Revenue's investigations will extend over a number of years and that it will be prioritising cases based on the size of the accounts. I am also advised that it is quite possible that a considerable number of the outstanding cases will have availed of the 1993 amnesty. The Revenue Commissioners will review the position as they proceed and will report on progress in their annual reports. Revenue has indicated it is determined to see this project through as efficiently and effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the general 2% stamp duty charge, as the position regarding the insurance compensation fund levy, introduced following the collapse of the PMPA in 1983, was explained by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Noel Treacy, in response to a similar question from the Deputy on 9 October last.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the stamp duty 2% levy on non-life insurance premiums applies to most categories of non-life insurance business, the exceptions being reinsurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance. The insurance companies pay the levy <i>en bloc </i>to the Revenue Commissioners and, therefore, there is no breakdown of the total yield attributable to each chargeable category.</P>
      <P>The levy was originally introduced in 1982 at a rate of 1% on chargeable non-life premiums. The rate was subsequently increased to 2% in 1993. The purpose of the levy is to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue. The money raised from this stamp duty charge makes a significant contribution to tax revenue collected. The yield in 2000 was £44.86 million. I have no plans to abolish the charge.</P>

      <P>A revenue sheriff executing a certificate under section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, is entitled to charge and add to the sum certified in the certificate and to collect under the certificate appropriate fees and expenses which are set out in the Sheriffs' Fees and Expenses Order, 1998. The debt legally due by a taxpayer in such circumstances is the full debt, inclusive of fees and expenses.</P>
      <P>A payment made by a taxpayer is, therefore, made against the full debt due and not against a particular component of the debt. In those circumstances, it is not possible for a taxpayer to direct a particular payment to the Revenue Commissioners through the sheriff.</P>

    <P>It is an important aspect of the tax collection system that, in the interests of equity, the costs of enforcement action, where it becomes necessary <Col N="1132" /> to involve the revenue sheriff, and where the tax is properly due, is borne by those non-compliant taxpayers who fail to meet their tax payment obligations in a timely fashion.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that steady progress has been made in the past few months to enable the programme to become fully operational. A series of information meetings have already been held across the six Border counties and agencies appointed to deliver the programmes are finalising their application processes. Application forms are available for several elements of the programme with some elements due to be opened for applications later this year or early in 2002. Project selection for those elements of the programme for which applications have been invited is under way.

      <P>The programme is being managed by the Special EU Programmes Body, one of six North-South Implementation Bodies established by the Good Friday Agreement and is being implemented in the Border region by a range of delivery agencies. These agencies are ADM-CPA, a joint venture comprising Area Development Management Limited and the Combat Poverty Agency, which will implement economic development and social inclusion measures, six county council-led task forces working under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to deliver aspects of the programme focusing on locally based regeneration strategies, the Special EU Programmes Body itself and the Departments of Education and Science, Marine and Natural Resources, and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and a consortium consisting of ADM, CPA, the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust, and Co-operation Ireland, in relation to cross-Border co-operative activities.</P>
      <P>Including matching national funds, 141.3 million &ndash; £111.3 million &ndash;  has been allocated to the Border region under the Peace and Reconciliation Programme, 2000-04. The EU contribution to the programme in the Border region is 106 million &ndash; £83.5 million.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1952, only allows for the adoption of orphans and children born outside marriage. The matter of the adoption of children of a marital relationship was raised with the Attorney General's office in the context of the drafting of the Adoption Act, 1988, which provides that in exceptional cases the High Court may make an order under section 3 authorising the adoption of children where both parents have failed in their duty towards them. These are the only limited circumstances in which children born within marriage may be adopted under the adoption Acts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is progressing two major pieces of adoption legislation, the Adoption Information, Post-Adoption Contact and Associated Issues Bill, and a Bill to ratify The Hague Convention on inter-country adoption. The issue raised by the Deputy is complex and has been brought to my attention by the Adoption Board. The question of further amendments of adoption legislation will be considered when work on these two Bills has been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Springboard is a pilot programme of support for vulnerable families initiated by the Department of Health and Children with funding from the Cabinet committee on social inclusion through the young people's facilities and services fund.</P>
      <P>The initiative was launched in 1998 and has been driven centrally by the child care policy unit in the Department of Health and Children. Health boards established 14 family support projects in communities located throughout the country. The projects are supported at local level by community, voluntary and statutory partners and at national level by an interdepartmental monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>The springboard projects have been extensively evaluated and a final evaluation report on the pilot phase is due to be published in December 2001. In addition, two policy papers on family support have been published under the springboard initiative with a third relating to fathers and families due to be published shortly. A number of training seminars on relevant topics have also been organised for project staff and stakeholders.</P>
      <P>A total of £7.685 million &ndash; 9.76 million &ndash; has been allocated to these projects. The young people's facilities and services fund provided £7.2 million &ndash; 9.14 million &ndash; during the three year pilot phase. The pilot phase continued into 2001 due to the delay in establishing some of the projects. Funding has been allocated as follows: £1.625 million &ndash; 2.06 million &ndash; in 1998, £1.5 million &ndash; 1.9 million &ndash; in 1999, £1.8 million &ndash; 2.28 million &ndash; in 2000 and £2.76 million &ndash; 3.5 million &ndash; in 2001.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children allocated additional funding to establish three new projects in 2001. Funding allocated to date for these projects totals £775,000 &ndash; 1.02 million.</P>

      <P>There are designated guidelines and timescales for the investigation of allegations of bullying and harassment in the heath service agreed between the Health Service Employers Agency, health service employers and unions. The process includes an informal procedure, a formal procedure and finally an investigation process. The investigation is required to be completed as soon as possible, but not later than four weeks after the receipt of the written complaint, unless there are exceptional circumstances. The investigating team then submits its findings to senior management. If senior management decides, on the basis of the report, that the complaint is well-founded and the alleged bully has a case to answer, the matter may be further progressed through the disciplinary procedure or other appropriate action may be taken.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness &ndash; for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>Persons with any of the above illnesses may apply to their local health board for admission to the long-term illness scheme. If eligible, they are issued with a long-term illness book. This lists the drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition that will be provided to them free of charge through their community pharmacist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical <Col N="1141" /> cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 or 53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. Whether or not a person is in receipt of disability benefit is not in itself relevant to whether that person is eligible for either a medical card or for admission to the long-term illness scheme. Policy in relation to eligibility for health services will be outlined in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>The driver theory testing service is operated as a public-private partnership project. A key performance standard contained in the customer charter for the driver theory testing service is that tests are to be offered at centres undertaking more than 250 tests per annum within two weeks of a candidate's preferred date. In other less used centres, tests are to be offered within two months of the preferred date at the chosen centre. Persons booking a test by telephone to the call centre are given their test appointment details at that stage. This is normally followed up with written confirmation of their appointment details within 24 hours or no later than three working days. Persons submitting postal applications are notified in writing of their appointment details within the same timescale.</P>
      <P>The driver theory testing service has procedures in place for dealing with complaints, including any in relation to late receipt of notification of test appointments, which may be addressed to the customer service manager at PO box 144, Drogheda , County Louth. The granting of further tests without payment of fees would be a matter for determination by the driver theory testing service as part of the complaints consideration process. The service commenced on 11 June 2001 and, up to the end of October 2001, some 30,600 tests had been carried out. To date, I understand that the service has received some 18 formal written complaints regarding late receipt of notification of test appointments.</P>

      <P>The operation of the shared ownership scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for individual housing authorities. Otherwise, the determination of the amount of loan which may be advanced, the maximum house price and the relevant proportions between purchased and rented elements are matters for the local authority, having regard to the circumstances of each individual applicant.

      <P>The current variable interest rate to local authority borrowers in respect of the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes is 4.3%. The current fixed rate available for loans under the affordable housing scheme is 5.3% for a period of five years. There is no fixed rate available for shared ownership loans. The interest rate on local authority housing loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. These rates compare favourably with the equivalent rates charged by commercial lending agencies.</P>
      <P>The local authorities' mortgage protection plan has applied, subject to the terms of the plan, to all house purchase loans approved on or after 1 July 1986. The terms of the cover offered by the plan are re-negotiated every two years by the mortgage protection insurance committee on which the County and City Managers' Association, my Department and the Housing Finance Agency are represented. The current rate applicable to all loans in respect of mortgage protection is 0.67%.</P>

      <P>Draft regulations in relation to the proposed introduction of a 15 cent &ndash; 12p &ndash; levy on plastic shopping bags were issued for public consultation on 18 September 2001. The draft regulations provide that the levy will take effect from 4 February 2002. It will apply to all plastic bags suitable for use by customers at the point of sale in supermarkets, service stations or other sales outlets, except those exempted in the draft regulations for food hygiene reasons. Provision is not made for an exemption for degradable bags as the levy proposals have a strong anti-litter emphasis.</P>
      <P>A number of interested parties have sought changes to, or exemptions from, the regulations, including in relation to bio-degradable bags. For this reason, it is neither desirable nor appropriate for me to address any specific aspect of the changes or exemptions sought in advance of final decisions in relation to all submissions which have been received. The submissions are now being evaluated, and I intend to make the final regulations within the next few weeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The hazardous waste list established by Council Decision 94/904/EC, which is currently in force, does not classify bottom ash from municipal waste incineration as a hazardous waste. With effect from 1 January 2002, Commission Decision 2000/532/EC, as amended, will replace Council Decision 94/904/EC. Under this Commission decision, bottom ash from waste incineration containing dangerous substances will be classified as <Col N="1146" /> a hazardous waste, while bottom ashes other than those containing dangerous substances will be classified as non-hazardous waste.</P>
    <P>The annex to Commission decision 2000/532/EC specifies, <i>inter alia,</i> that where waste on the hazardous waste list is identified as hazardous by a specific or general reference to dangerous substances, it is hazardous only if the concentrations of those substances are such, that is, percentage by weight, that the waste presents one or more of the properties listed in Annex III to Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste. Article 2 of the decision specifies relevant concentrations of substances in respect of certain of the properties listed in Annex III of Directive 91/689/EEC.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future management of bottom ash from waste incineration, it would be a matter for the relevant competent authority, in this case the Environmental Protection Agency, to determine whether bottom ash from a given facility is hazardous or non-hazardous having regard to the provisions of Council Directive 91/689/EEC and Commission Decision 2000/532/EC, as amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent estimate of the number of full-time carers is available from the results of the census pilot survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office. This survey was carried out in September 1999 and is based on a sample of 8,000 households in which persons aged 15 years or over were asked if they provided unpaid personal help for someone with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age. The detailed results are as follows: 35,000 people provide more than 50 hours unpaid personal help per week, or seven hours per day; 17,000 people provide 20 to 49 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between three and seven hours per day; 79,000 people provide one to 19 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between nine minutes and 2.5 hours per day.</P>
      <P>There are almost 19,000 carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit. These are income maintenance payments in respect of full-time care and attention. These figures show that over 36% of the 52,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for a carer's allowance a person must be providing full-time care and attention to a person who is certified to be in need of such care. The payment is subject to a means test. An applicant may therefore not qualify for one of a number of reasons. Of the 7,500 claims received <Col N="1149" /> this year, approximately 51% of claims refused were refused for reasons relating to the need for or provision of care. Where applications are refused on these grounds, full-time care is either not required or is not being provided by the carer. About 8% of claims refused this year have been refused on the basis that the applicant's means exceed the limits and 41% of refusals have been for other miscellaneous reasons. This group includes carers who are in receipt of another, more beneficial social welfare payment  &ndash; 3% &ndash; carers who withdraw their application  &ndash; 8% &ndash; and carers who fail to reply to requests for further information regarding their claim &ndash; 18%.</P>
    <P>The respite care grant is payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. Extending this grant to all those considered to be carers would cost an estimated £50 million, 63 million. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the commitment to caring and the need for respite care can vary greatly. In the circumstances, I feel that issues related to respite care can only be dealt with in the context of a system of an overall needs assessment which is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme and the health strategy which will be published next Monday by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

A copy of my Department's submission has been forwarded to the Deputy for his information. In addition and resulting from an invitation from An Bord Pleanála to comment on other appeals submitted, my Department made a further submission on 8 October 2001 and a copy is again included for information purposes. As the matter now rests with An Bord Pleanála, I do not propose, in the interest of fairness to all interested parties, to comment further.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the granting of planning permission in any case is a matter solely for the relevant planning authority and An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>It would appear that this project is largely a community environmental type project which may have the potential to enhance the quality of life of the local community. In that context, the Deputy may wish to advise the project promoters that they should investigate the possibility of funding under various cross-Border programmes such as the new peace programme, the proposed new Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG III programme and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, I will be launching the new tourism product investment scheme under the national development plan shortly. This scheme will be implemented by Bord Fáilte in consultation with Shannon Development and the regional tourism authorities and decisions on individual projects will be made by an independent product management board mechanism as was the case for previous tourism operational programmes. The Deputy might like to advise the project promoters that they can obtain details of the scheme from the North West Regional Tourism Authority which covers the Monaghan area in order that they can determine whether they might be eligible to apply for funding under the scheme.</P>

      <P>In the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates, and to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject, and at the same time by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with the marking scheme for the work done. My Department instructs all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner to <Col N="1160" /> ensure that the candidate is given credit for all work done.</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application for grant aid towards the cost of a building project at the national school referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million &ndash; 470.4 million &ndash; which is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be taken, as in previous years, in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance in second level schools. The allocation ranges from 0.36 of a post &ndash; eight hours per week &ndash; in schools in the free education scheme with an enrolment of less than 200 pupils to two posts in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In the case of certain fee-charging schools, which are not in the free education scheme, 0.5 of a post is allocated in respect of the schools in the 350 to 499 enrolment category and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils. In addition to the allocation based on enrolments, 50 whole time equivalent guidance counselling posts were allocated this year under the guidance enhancement initiative. Some 103 second level schools will have benefited directly under the initiative.</P>
      <P>There are currently 630 whole time equivalent approved career guidance posts in second level schools. There are 15 schools outside of the free education scheme which do not receive an ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance. If these 15 fee-charging schools were to receive an allocation in respect of guidance on the same basis as schools within the scheme, approximately six extra posts would be required at an estimated annual cost of £150,000.</P>

Each building project has its own design team who work with the institute to progress the various projects through architectural planning and design. As yet, the design of none these projects is sufficiently complete to enable the projects to commence construction. Officials in my Department are very anxious that these projects proceed as quickly as possible through architectural planning and are in regular contact with the institute with regard to their progression. A decision on when each of the projects concerned will proceed to construction will be taken once architectural design has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions &ndash; the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The local authorities administer the schemes on behalf of my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. My Department reviews the schemes annually. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and <Col N="1164" /> remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC itself, in exceptional circumstances, may seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The fund's objectives, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. It is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Children with autistic spectrum disorder have access to a range of provision within the school system. The model and level of support provided in each case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. In some cases, children with autism can attend mainstream schools on an integrated basis with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. More commonly, the required response takes the form of placement in a special dedicated class which can be attached to a mainstream school or a special school. There are 93 such classes in place at present which all cater for <Col N="1165" /> a maximum of six pupils and each class has the support of a teacher and two special needs assistants. Additional therapeutic service inputs are provided by the relevant health authority.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above provision, my Department is currently funding the operation of three pilot projects which are using models of approach based on the applied behavioural analysis method. The objective is to test the effectiveness of this approach as a model of response to the educational needs of children with autism. A number of children with autistic spectrum disorder are also in receipt of home based tuition funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>Curriculum development for children with autistic spectrum disorder is based on detailed diagnostic psychological and other professional reports that indicate areas of strength and weakness in respect of each child, and on the mainstream or special curriculum adapted to meet the pupils' needs, age, ability and interests. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &ndash; NCCA &ndash; has been requested to prepare guidelines for schools on how the curriculum can be most readily accessed by children with autistic spectrum disorder. Teaching new, acceptable and functional behaviours and dispensing with unacceptable learned behaviours forms part of the curriculum for each child and will also be a focus of the NCCA guidelines.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, I established a special task force to review current approaches to addressing the educational needs of children with autism spectrum disorder and make recommendations for the future development of services in this area. Also, in May of this year, my Department commissioned the UK based National Foundation for Educational Research to carry out a review of all current State funded models of response to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports of both the task force on autism and the National Foundation for Educational Research were received in my Department very recently. Both reports, which are detailed and complex, address the range of important issues, to which the Deputy refers, and will now be considered in detail by my Department. I am confident that their findings will provide a valuable input into the future development of services for children with autistic spectrum disorder. In July of this year, the Government approved my proposals for the establishment of the national council for special education. It is intended that the <Col N="1166" /> council, which will be tasked with the provision of research, expert advice and service delivery functions in the special education area, including the area of autism, will develop a local area presence.</P>

      <P>The amount of capital expenditure spent by my Department in the years 1997 to 2000 is £800.9 million &ndash; 1016.9 million. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million &ndash; 470.4 million. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. I regret that the percentage of this figure allocated to projects in County Wicklow is not readily available, as the capital is distributed on a project by project basis.</P>
