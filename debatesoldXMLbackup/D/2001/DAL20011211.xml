    <Title>Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is my great pleasure to commence the Second Stage debate of the Sustainable Energy Bill in the Dáil. The Bill has been passed by the Seanad where it received a broad welcome. I now look forward to an interesting debate on this important issue in this House.</P>
      <P>Enactment of the Bill will impact on the vital issue of sustainable use of energy. It will also impact on the need to supply energy to a rapidly growing economy without continuing adverse effects on the environment. It is important to set out my definition of sustainable energy because sustainability is central to my efforts in this Bill and my efforts elsewhere in the energy field. In the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy sustainability is defined as ensuring that the needs of present generations can be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. I set out in the Green Paper that a sustainable energy policy should: ensure security of energy supply in order to support economic and social development while protecting the environment; maximise efficiency of generation and emphasise the use of renewable resources; promote energy conservation by users; minimise emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, both by clean generation and by sustainable consumption levels in all sectors; and maintain local air quality and limit and reduce the Irish contribution to regional and global environmental problems.</P>
      <P>The principal objective of the Bill is to establish the necessary legislative framework to allow the Irish Energy Centre to operate independently of Enterprise Ireland as a statutory body and to effect a change of title for the centre to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Needless to say, the Irish Energy Centre is central to the Government's plans to respond to the sustainable energy challenge as well as our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> I would like to give Deputies some background to the formation of the Irish Energy Centre. In 1995, as a joint initiative the Department of Public Enterprise and the agency formerly known as Forbairt, now Enterprise Ireland, established the centre. A Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Public Enterprise and Forbairt underpinned the position of the centre as a unit within Enterprise Ireland. That Memorandum of Understanding was intended to be an interim measure only, a step in the evolution of the centre into an independent, operationally autonomous agency. The Bill before the House will serve to clarify and improve the strategic direction of the centre and allow it the flexibility to develop its full potential as one of the significant implementing agencies in the Government's strategy on climate change and the promotion of energy efficiency measures and renewables. Enactment of the Bill will be an important step in the context of giving real intent to the Government's energy efficiency policies in a liberalised energy market.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on sustainable energy, which I published in September 1999, proposes a framework for energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy in Ireland. It sets out policy for both limiting energy related COf8&gt;2 emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy sources to help ensure Ireland's compliance with the UN Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The centre is central to the implementation of many of the programmes and measures set out in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>It might be opportune to give the up-to-date position on the Kyoto Protocol at this stage. The adverse effects of climate change are well documented and the publication of the third assessment report to coincide with the resumed negotiations in Bonn in July served to emphasise how these effects are becoming more prevalent. The EU member states are committed to maintaining a firm common position on the protocol and attended the resumed climate change negotiations in Bonn in July and the COP7 negotiations in Marrakech last month prepared to engage in meaningful dialogue with other parties. This determined attitude to finalise the technical details which remained to be resolved in order to make it possible for parties to ratify the protocol next year was rewarded with success in Marrakech and has cleared the way for ratification of the protocol next year. As evidence of this Government's continued commitment to Kyoto, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in a speech in Marrakech, committed Ireland to ratification of Kyoto in 2002.</P>
    <P>The agreements at Bonn and Marrakech also pave the way for the ratification of the protocol in 2002, as originally scheduled; hence the added urgency to this legislation in terms of meeting our overall commitments. Under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland has agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. <Col N="391" /> Our greenhouse gas emissions are currently more than 20% above 1990 levels. The latest ESRI forecast contained in its medium-term review suggests a significant rise above 1990 levels in our emissions by 2010 if we continue on a business as usual basis, principally as a result of our rapid economic growth. Energy related greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 and are forecast to increase to 63% in 2010 if we do not devise policies and measures to abate such emissions.</P>
    <P>These are stark statistics, which we cannot ignore. There is too much at stake for us and for future generations. The Government's national climate change strategy, published in October 2000, establishes the framework within which we will seek to achieve the necessary cuts in emissions. The strategy, like the Green Paper on sustainable energy, foresees a major implementing role for the centre. When introducing the Bill to the Seanad, I paid tribute to staff of the Irish Energy Centre. Most of us are aware of the excellent work they do in the area of energy awareness through energy awareness week, car free day and their excellent schools programme. However, I also put on record their work over the period of the economic infrastructure operational programme. In particular, the contribution made under such programmes as the energy efficiency investment support scheme and the self audit scheme was brought to the attention of Senators. I wish to repeat that tribute in this House.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that all the staff currently working in the Irish Energy Centre will become members of the staff of the new authority. The current staff of the centre are either permanent or contract staff of Forfas. It is essential that the majority of the existing staff switch to the new authority. Their dedication, experience and expertise is vital to the new organisation. I am satisfied that the provisions of the legislation in relation to tenure of office, terms and conditions, salaries, and superannuation ensure that all current staff of the centre move to the new authority with conditions no less favourable than those they enjoyed as members of the staff of Forfas. It is only to be expected that some staff might have concerns in relation to these issues and others such as career paths, promotional outlets, and opportunities for training and development.</P>
    <P>These issues must be addressed quickly and addressed with openness and frankness as to the opportunities a transfer to the new authority will present. In recognition of that need, I have set up a consultative forum to address these issues. The forum, which is meeting regularly, consists of senior officials from my Department, the relevant trade union representatives of the staff, and Enterprise Ireland. With the necessary dialogue and goodwill on all sides these matters can be resolved to the satisfaction of existing staff. We are endeavouring to provide the utmost clarity for existing staff of the centre. I assure this <Col N="392" /> House, and the staff in question, that as an independent body under the aegis of my Department, the ethos of the new authority will be one with a strong human resource focus and a commitment to the proper training and development of all staff. This is a situation where we can truly say that the experience and expertise of staff is the most valuable resource of the centre. We will ensure that the new authority manage and develop that resource accordingly.</P>
    <P>On account of the mammoth task facing the new centre, and as I was conscious of the need to have the necessary institutional arrangements in place immediate on the enactment of this legislation, I appointed an interim board for the centre last December. Professor Frank Convery of the Environmental Research Unit in University College Dublin is chairperson of the interim board. I am delighted with the progress made by this board in carrying out its mandate to oversee the transition of the centre from Enterprise Ireland and examining institutional issues such as structure and staffing arrangements. The interim board has had a number of meetings and is currently meeting on a monthly basis in order to progress the many issues that arise. Considerable work has been done, for instance, in developing a three-year work programme, which was recently approved by the board. The bulk of that programme is based on the funding provisions of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme within the framework of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The interim board was instrumental in ensuring that a professional study was carried out in order to ensure a structure and staffing level appropriate to the proposed mandate for the new authority. As a result, the centre has sanction for a new structure and 30 additional posts that will bring the staff complement to 50. The centre is currently engaged in the first phase of the recruitment process. Some 15 new staff members will be recruited before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the new work programmes of the centre getting under way. In June of this year, I launched an energy efficiency scheme in public sector design studies followed by the second phase, the model solutions investment support scheme, in August. A third phase of this programme, support for energy management bureaux operations is being planned. When one considers that the public capital programme for 2001 provides for expenditure of 7.6 billion, of which approximately 1.9 billion relates to expenditure on new buildings and major refurbishment of existing buildings, one can see how important this is.</P>
    <P>I launched a major research and development scheme, entitled the House of Tomorrow Programme on September 26 of this year. This programme, which has a proposed budget of 21.1 million, offers support for research, development and demonstration projects aimed at generating and applying technologies, products, systems, <Col N="393" /> practices and information leading to more sustainable energy performance in Irish housing.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the important work being carried out in the area of energy awareness. I believe that many Deputies agree with me when I say that much can be achieved in this area. There is no cheaper solution to the energy emission problem than the conservation of energy and the careful use of energy by all. I firmly believe that it is possible to change the lifetime habits of a society. I am satisfied that with effective awareness campaigns and proper education the harmful effects of wasteful use of energy can be reduced. Evidence of this can be seen with the annual energy awareness week which is held in October each year and is co-ordinated by the centre. It remains the single most important platform for promoting energy efficiency in Ireland. The primary target audience is household consumers. The campaign informs them of how much energy is used on a domestic basis and the potential for savings there, from where this energy comes and the longer term implications of current consumption trends.</P>
    <P>The week has proved very successful in raising awareness of the sustainable use of our energy resources and research indicated that consumer investment in specifically targeted energy efficient products increased by 680% during the period of the Energy Awareness Week campaign in 2000. The Energy Awareness Week 2000 campaign resulted in additional energy savings of over 2.5 million being achieved in Ireland. This represents a reduction in C0f8&gt;2 emissions of 21,500 tonnes per annum.</P>
    <P>Speaking of education, this is where I believe real progress can be achieved. I would like, for instance, to see a comprehensive campaign for schools developed for teachers and students starting with the junior schools and working up to secondary and beyond. I know, and I am pleased, that the centre is working hard on developing its website and making effective use of the Internet to promulgate the message. We are all aware of how adept children are in the use of modern technology so I applaud the efforts of the centre in this regard. I am looking forward to and I am excited by the prospect of future developments in the centre's schools programme.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the definition of sustainable energy I outlined for Members earlier, Members will know that action is required on a number of fronts. I am a great believer in the role that can be played by renewable energy. In the Green Paper I set a much increased target of 500 megawatts of electricity for the contribution of renewable energy towards our Kyoto obligations. In May of this year, I had the pleasure of announcing the fifth alternative energy requirement competition. Under AER V, I am providing market support at various prices for a number of renewable technologies, including large scale wind energy, small scale wind, biomass and small scale hydro power. The amount of capacity on offer, at 255 megawatts, is the largest yet under an AER <Col N="394" /> programme. It is just over half the target I set for the period up to 2005 in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy. It is more than double the initial offer in AER III.</P>
    <P>In announcing the competition I said the achievement of the target will generate sufficient electricity to feed 180,000 domestic houses, prevent the emission of over one million tonnes of polluting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, save on the import of more than 300,000 tonnes of crude oil and other fossil fuels, contribute savings equivalent to almost 10% of our Kyoto obligation and create an investment opportunity in excess of 254 million.</P>
    <P>The announcement of AER V is a practical demonstration of my resolve and that of the Government to promote the renewable energy sector. It is also self-evident renewable energy can be foremost among the solutions needed to meet our Kyoto obligations. In concluding this point I should record that the accelerated programme I am implementing builds on the pioneering work on the promotion of renewables commenced by my predecessor in this office, Deputy Stagg. I have been pleased to acknowledge the contribution by Deputy Stagg in other fora, in particular at a recent wind energy conference in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with some aspects of the Bill other than those relating to staffing and terms and conditions of employment which I have already mentioned. The functions of the new authority are set out in a comprehensive way in section 6 of the Bill. Its functions are essentially to promote and assist energy efficiency measures across the whole economy, to assist and promote the development of electricity generation from renewable sources and, importantly, to advise Ministers in all matters relating to its functions. In this respect, I would foresee that the authority would provide crucial input to future policy development in the area of sustainable energy.</P>
    <P>The accommodation needs of the new authority are dealt with in section 20. For clarity, I will set out the background to its current accommodation. Currently, the centre is located in a purpose built energy efficient building in the Enterprise Ireland complex in Glasnevin. The site is wholly owned by Enterprise Ireland. Under the original memorandum of understanding, which established the centre, Enterprise Ireland undertook to provide the necessary accommodation. A site was provided and a specially designed building was constructed on it with European Union funding.</P>
    <P>A number of issues now arise in relation to the Glasnevin site. First, Enterprise Ireland intends to relocate its entire staff, currently located in a number of offices throughout the city, to the Glasnevin site. As one would expect, this will result in an evaluation of the buildings, structures and accommodation already on the site. Second, the current Irish Energy Centre building will need to be extended to house the proposed increase in staff. Third, there is the consideration <Col N="395" /> that the new board may wish to ensure its independence from Enterprise Ireland physically as well as statutorily.</P>
    <P>In response to the many considerations affecting the Glasnevin site, it was necessary to find a solution, which, on the one hand, would ensure that the authority would have accommodation for its staff on vesting day and, on the other hand, would enable Enterprise Ireland to retain ownership of the entire site. I decided, with the approval of the Government, that the new authority should be given a licence to remain in its existing building at least until there is greater clarity as to the intentions of all the main parties towards development of the site. Needless to say, the accommodation issue is one that is exercising the minds of Professor Convery and the other members of the interim board and I understand from the chairman that the issue is high on the agenda of the interim board. Section 20 provides that the authority is to be given a licence to remain as tenant in its existing accommodation with effect from vesting day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financing of the new authority, the Bill, in section 21, provides that the Minister shall from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, advance to the centre out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas such sums as the Minister may determine for the purposes of expenditure by the centre in the performance of its functions. Provision is made in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for an allocation of 185 million over the duration of the plan for the purpose of increasing energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy related initiatives. This funding is intended to support the measures outlined in the Green Paper on sustainable energy. Particular emphasis is placed on the promotion of energy efficiency measures, research and development, renewable energy-combined heat and power, and energy efficient houses and public sector buildings. An element of that funding relates to the day to day activities of the new enlarged centre. Funding arrangements for the new authority are therefore largely in place.</P>
    <P>I will bring forward some minor amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. In particular, I will make amendments to Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, to amend the provisions in that Act relating to the public service obligation. Many Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, proposes to introduce a public service obligation, order under the 1999 Act, requiring the ESB to purchase the output of certain peat and renewable electricity generating stations.</P>
    <P>This PSO has particular relevance to my policy on the promotion of renewable energy, which I referred to earlier. During prolonged discussions with the EU Competition Directorate on the State aid aspects of the PSO, it emerged that the PSO funding mechanism, as had been provided for in section 39 of the 1999 Act, which is based <Col N="396" /> on the consumption of electricity by final customers, would have a distorting impact on Irish electricity market. It is therefore necessary to amend section 39 of the 1999 Act to ensure that the enabling power for the PSO complies with the EU Commission decision approving the PSO. While these amendments will not have any material impact on the public service obligations, they are necessary from a technical perspective.</P>
    <P>I am signalling my intention to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to increase the borrowing powers of Bord Gáis Éireann. I had initially proposed providing for this increase in the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001. However, due to unforeseen delays in the progress of that Bill and the urgent need for this provision, I am now proposing to use the Bill before the House as a vehicle for bringing this matter forward. The current borrowing limit of 698 million is set out in section 23 of the Gas Act, 1976, as amended. This needs to be increased urgently to accommodate BGE's large capital expenditure requirements over the next two years and the proposed amendment provides for increasing the borrowing limit to 1.1 billion. The capital expenditure is related to the upgrading and expansion of the existing gas transmission and distribution networks. This includes major infrastructural projects such as the pipeline to the west and the second Scotland-Ireland interconnector which is required to ensure security of energy supply for the winter of 2002-03. My proposal to include the relevant amendment in this Bill is based on the fact that BGE has already started work on these projects and will need to take advantage of the increased borrowing limits shortly.</P>
    <P>I look forward with great anticipation to the establishment of the new authority. The interim board has already given us a feeling for how energetic the new authority will be. I am encouraged by the enthusiasm being shown by existing staff and the boost that will be given by the infusion of new staff over the coming months. I am more satisfied than ever that we are going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I protest in the strongest possible fashion at the way this legislation is being guillotined through the House. It is a disgrace that a Bill which has lain around since it passed the Seanad last May is now being bulldozed through the Dáil in just three hours two weeks before Christmas. That is totally wrong and there is no need for it. I cannot see why this Bill could not have been accommodated earlier in the session. I have no problem with the Bill but I have a major problem with the Government decision to abort the debate without affording Deputies from all sides the opportunity to have an input into it and to ventilate their views on the agency and its functions, ambitions and direction. They should also have the chance to talk generally about energy policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> Second Stage debates by their very scope and intent are meant to offer Deputies a chance to examine the broad thrust of Government policy and also to set out their stalls on particular issues. The Chair will see the number of speakers due to speak on this Bill but the decision to curtail this debate means many Deputies with good ideas on energy policies will not have a chance to contribute. It is wrong that nine Deputies at most, including the Minister of State in his initial and summary speeches, can now participate in the debate. This is a negation of democracy and is wrong.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in that it sets up the Irish Energy Centre on a statutory, independent and stand-alone basis. I acknowledge the contribution the centre and its staff have made to the development of energy efficient attitudes, policies and practices. However, I am at a loss to know how its newly acquired independence status will enhance its effectiveness by virtue of the fact that the Minister of State acknowledged today and in the Seanad that, although it has been an appendage of Enterprise Ireland to an extent, it is nonetheless independent as it stands in exercising its functions. Perhaps the Minister of State will spell out the additional benefits, advantages and powers which will accrue to the agency as a result of passing this legislation.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the agency's contribution since its establishment in 1995. The energy efficiency investment scheme has allocated over £7 million in grants and has given rise to energy savings of £8.5 million and private sector investment of £31 million, which I commend. The self-audit scheme for high energy consumers has succeeded in significantly reducing energy consumption on the part of companies. It has also helped to decrease emissions of COf8&gt;2 greenhouse gases. The programme should be vigorously promoted and more companies are encouraged to participate for the sake of their efficiency and economies, and from an environmental perspective.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Energy Awareness Week, which is an excellent idea, and he referred to the targets of saving 2.5 million and reducing COf8&gt;2 emissions by 21.5 tonnes. I wonder, however, without wishing to be cynical, who will be charged with determining the success of Energy Awareness Week. While it is a good idea, the message is not getting through to the average citizen. A great deal of energy is still wasted and we need to transmit the message of saving resources to the ordinary consumer and to small industries.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline the programmes that will be promoted by the new Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. What level of investment will be put into the programmes? There is no use talking about aspirations unless we are specific. What kind of timescale is involved? What targets have been set? I presume, now that an independent agency is being established, that a plan is being set out for the agency's staff. New, dynamic and attractive programmes are vital if we are to reduce our energy bill and if <Col N="398" /> we are to adhere to the Kyoto guidelines. I have said on many occasions that this country has a huge tendency to sign up to protocols and conventions but we are considerably less than assiduous in adhering to their demands and objectives. We did not hesitate to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol but our attempts to achieve its targets have been appalling.</P>
    <P>A number of months ago the Government of the United States decided that it was to have nothing to do with the Kyoto Protocol as its demands did not suit American industry. The US President, Mr. Bush, must have been sorely tempted to issue a riposte to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, who lectured the US Administration. If there was ever a case of a Government in a glasshouse throwing stones, this was it. We will not be in a position to preach, pontificate or lecture until we put our house in order, or at least until we make a serious attempt to meet the targets to which we signed up at Kyoto.</P>
    <P>The figures mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, in his speech speak for themselves:</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland has agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. Our greenhouse gas emissions are currently more than 20% above 1990 levels. The latest ESRI forecast contained in its medium-term review suggests a significant rise above 1990 levels in our emissions by 2010 if we continue on a business as usual basis, principally as a result of our rapid economic growth. Energy related greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 and are forecast to increase to 63% in 2010 if we do not devise policies and measures to abate such emissions.</P>
    <P>We are lecturing the United States despite the fact that our emissions are above 1990 levels, which is a flagrant breach of an international protocol to which we are a signatory. I realise that the Irish Energy Centre has tried to address this problem, but the situation remains appalling. We are behaving in a hypocritical manner and the figures are a damning indictment of our performance.</P>
    <P>Five weeks ago I asked the Minister of State to outline the amount of electricity generated from wind and other sources. His reply indicated that, in 2000, 225 gigawatt hours of electricity were generated from wind energy, 6,815 gigawatt hours were generated from coal, 1,777 gigawatt hours were generated from peat, 4,629 gigawatt hours were generated from oil, 9,172 gigawatt hours were generated from natural gas, 847 gigawatt hours were generated from water and 96 gigawatt hours from combustible renewables and waste. Without a major shift in policy involving an effective and comprehensive range of measures, the situation as regards greenhouse gas emissions will <Col N="399" /> continue to deteriorate and embarrass Ireland politically and damage us environmentally.</P>
    <P>Ireland has totally failed to decouple economic growth and energy consumption. Interim targets set for 2005 will not be met and there is a lack of appreciation of the seriousness of these issues. The industry feels that any action we take will make no difference as Ireland accounts for only 0.1% of global warming. We try to comfort ourselves in the knowledge that developed countries have a bigger cross to bear as they are main sources of COf8&gt;2 emissions. We point the finger at these countries because the high levels of COf8&gt;2 belching from their electricity generating stations and industrial plants are destroying the ozone layer which protects the earth from the sun's rays. We think of the large industrial nations as being to blame for global warming which contributes to climate change and which will eventually have significant consequences for the earth's inhabitants as temperatures continue to rise. All the evidence suggests that temperatures are continuing to rise.</P>
    <P>Over the past 100 years the annual rate of increase in temperature has gone up from 0.3º to 0.6º centigrade. This increase has resulted in significant climate change causing severe drought and famine in many areas. Our attitude is to shrug our shoulders and to suggest that climate change is none of our business as it does not affect us. However, this is not the case. There has been an obvious change in climate in Ireland over the past seven or eight years giving rise to unprecedented flooding and coastal erosion due to rising sea levels. Despite these facts we continue to shrug our shoulders. We are fortunate in that the prevailing westerly winds blow emissions towards other countries. Emissions from the Moneypoint electricity generating station have little effect on this country, but significantly impact on Scandinavia as the prevailing south-westerly winds blow them in its direction.</P>
    <P>Industry will have to be educated to the prospect that, in 2020, the world market in carbon may be the most active trading market of any commodity. Policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will fail unless their sources, particularly carbon, become traded commodities with an adequate premium to discourage and penalise high emissions and to incentivise and reward clean, green alternatives. The Kyoto Protocol commitments are demanding on Ireland. We do not avail of nuclear power and we have limited hydro-electric generating capacity. We are particularly vulnerable as 86% of our energy is generated using imported fossil fuels. In the UK, for example, steps have been taken and the coal mines have been closed down. In central and eastern Europe, old polluting plants are being taken out of commission. Our industrial development has been relatively recent and thus plant does not have the potential for emission reductions. Furthermore, agricultural methane production will undoubtedly grow rather than <Col N="400" /> remain stable. Such generic issues when added to our economic growth will cause us real problems in meeting our UN commitment.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these national issues, the only way we will realise our Kyoto objectives and commitments is to introduce an international system within the EU envelope of emissions trading. This would put a price on a tonne of carbon which would have to be payable over a certain sectoral level of gas output, for example, the 1990 levels, from which that industry would have to pay a surcharge for its excess greenhouse gas emissions. This would allow international trade in courses of carbon and other gases by both sectors and individual businesses.</P>
    <P>This will not work unless there is an adequate disincentive in place. If people are rewarded for doing nothing the whole process will be a waste of time. Fine Gael will actively support a trading mechanism whereby countries such as Denmark, which has reduced its greenhouse emissions by 27%, will have greenhouse gas tonnages to sell because of their effective environmental policies. The EU institutions will have to introduce a realistic price for carbon that would make it a tradeable commodity.</P>
    <P>It is only within this context that sectoral deals can be done on output limits and negotiated taxes. Fine Gael favours the early implementation of such a fiscal system that would give industry, electricity generators and others the necessary market to ensure national compliance with our Kyoto commitments. Allied to this would be the establishment of a national green credit system whereby businesses would be rewarded for reductions in their emissions. Current high inflation rates make it politically difficult to introduce a general carbon or eco-tax. The emissions trading mechanism is the only viable proposal that would not result in a loss of national competitiveness but provide a sustainable basis for each member state to meet its Kyoto obligations.</P>
    <P>The resolution of these issues will become more difficult and more costly with every delay in the implementation of such policies. This is due to the ever worsening amounts by which we are exceeding our emission limits to a record annual growth GDP. These measures simply cannot be postponed.</P>
    <P>My party believes the conversion of Moneypoint electricity generating station from coal to natural gas is vital and should be proceeded with. This would reduce emissions by 3 million tonnes per year and would also lead to a significant reduction is COf8&gt;2 emissions, nationally and internationally. The re-regulation of the liberalised electricity market to give absolute preferential treatment to combined heat and power plants is an absolute necessity.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is committed to facilitating the establishment of combined heat and electricity generating projects in industrial estates to provide, for example, localised heating and electricity needs for that site up to a maximum output in capacity <Col N="401" /> in megawatts, so that it would not be a competitive electricity generator but efficiently used energy for the needs of that location. This would reduce energy consumption and provide far greater efficiencies.</P>
    <P>Future electricity generating plants that are not using renewable sources of energy should only obtain licences if they are 80% efficient. Currently, there is enough waste heat from our electricity generating sector to provide for the entire heating requirements of this country. The heat currently wasted from Irish power stations is the equivalent of 21 million barrels of oil and worth more than $600 million a year.</P>
    <P>My party will favour the introduction of green credits to reward and encourage new green electricity suppliers.</P>
    <P>Eco-labelling of electricity will be mandatory on all bills. Nationally, targets should be set to increase the proportion of our energy expenditure on renewable resources from 0.5% to 5% of total expenditure. These renewable resources include wind, biomass, hydro and solar power. Energy expenditure this year will be in the region of £4,000 million to £4,500 million. Specific commitments to purchase wind energy will be necessary to meet this objective.</P>
    <P>My party also believes it is essential to set a national target for over 10% of total electricity output to be derived from renewable energy sources by 2010. In current terms, this is the equivalent of 540 MW. A package of incentives to support wind and other renewable energy resources will be required for the business expansion scheme, capital allowances and the treatment of energy leasing partnerships. In Government, we will be committed to prioritising the introduction of Government procurement policies to discriminate positively in favour of green products and green services. The direct State purchases of electricity, energy and transport should have an established quota of green renewable resources. All public service vehicles should be low or no-emission vehicles. This is not currently the case, as anybody who drives behind such vehicles will testify.</P>
    <P>To improve awareness levels and address the information deficit about our commitments, the following should be done as a matter of urgency: first, the environmental sector should be included as an additional pillar in social partnership as well as being a full member of NESF; and, second, Government development plans must be environmentally proofed. Fine Gael wants environment economic units within key Departments to give <i>ex ante</i> appraisal of Government development plans and policies, including fiscal policy, and to ensure compliance with EU targets and UN protocols. All electricity plants, without exception, must obtain IPC licences. Greater efforts are needed to reduce greenhouse emissions in the energy production, transport and agricultural sectors. There is further scope for EPA and IPC licensing in these sectors. We favour, for example, all electricity plants having to obtain IPC licences, not <Col N="402" /> just the modern ones. The whole area of IPC licensing should be reviewed as a matter of urgency as a key instrument to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>Non-governmental organisations should be provided with money to promote awareness. We are committed when in Government to providing, for example, annual funding to NGOs in the environmental sector in order that they can promote greater public awareness and understanding of key environmental concerns. The participation and co-operation of the NGO sector is absolutely essential. It should not simply be Government agency-driven. Each Government memorandum for Cabinet approval should require an environmental audit to state the effects, if any, on the environment of each Government proposal or decision.</P>
    <P>There should be a ten year energy reduction programme for all Departments. We believe it is very important to introduce an energy efficiency programme for all Departments targeting a reduction in energy consumption of between 20% and 30% over ten years. All new and refurbished public buildings built by or for the State, including social housing, should have a high energy specification and should preferably include a green heating system. The Government, State agencies and local authorities should be leading the way but, unfortunately, they are not. High energy specification building regulations should be introduced immediately. It is essential, in view of the number of houses likely to be built in the immediate future &ndash; and there is a huge need out there &ndash; that the new building regulations due to come into effect in 2005 be front-loaded and introduced as soon as possible. This is vital from the point of view of energy efficiency, not to mention our compliance with Kyoto.</P>
    <P>The taxation regime should also be investigated. Effective incentives and deterrents should be used to promote the purchase of renewable sources of electricity and energy efficient equipment. Fine Gael advocates different VAT rates on electricity products and electrical goods, for example 5% VAT on green products and 12.5% on non-renewable sources. Furthermore, increased resources must be put into public transport to encourage people to switch from private transport. Dublin city is absolutely chaotic at present. Operation Freeflow was introduced last week but the day of its introduction was the most chaotic in Dublin since Christmas week of last year. Cars were stuck in a total logjam and simply could not move.</P>
    <P>At this time, 6,000 cars are being purchased per week in spite of the slowdown of the Celtic tiger and we are still below the EU average for car ownership. The availability of public transport is dire because investment has not been put into it over the years. This is not a political point. We are stuck with a situation which will become progressively worse over the next five to six years due to the lack of buses, the failure to introduce integrated ticketing, the dearth of quality bus cor<Col N="403" /> ridors and the fact that, in spite of all the promises, park-and-ride is a dream rather than reality. Moreover, Luas will not be operational, no matter what anybody says, until 2004 or 2005.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also favours tax breaks for green fuels. Something must be done about the taxation regime for vehicles with high emissions. We will remove excise duties on liquid biofuels. We will also promote and incentivise short rotation forestry for fuels in the national forestry programme, which will provide valuable greenhouse gas sinks. The Minister alluded to something about which Fine Gael also feels strongly, namely, the need for a major programme of education, information and public awareness, to be introduced on a national basis, not in a hit-and-miss fashion. More than one energy awareness week is required. We need to hit the problem hard because of our CO2 emissions and the consequences for climate change and from the point of view of good citizen practice.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of Energy Action under the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation need to be implemented. It has recommended, for example, investment over ten years of £1.3 billion to improve insulation standards in housing. Innovation in the renewable energy sector is absolutely essential if we are to manage Ireland's energy demands up to 2015. This will yield very significant savings. Similarly, investment in research, development and demonstration of new and renewable energy conservation processes such as ocean wave, integrated renewable energy systems, fuel cell technology, active solar heating and biomass technologies should be actively supported with appropriate State aid.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the new status of the agency which will follow the passage of the legislation, but as I asked at the outset, what additional benefits, advantages or powers will accrue to it? There is huge potential out there that has not been tapped into. We have been mind-bogglingly slow in pursuing new technology and new opportunities and appreciating what we have. We have everything we need in terms of renewable energy; for example, we have the greatest wave potential power in western Europe. Yet, we have not tapped into it despite the amount of research carried out in universities in Scotland and other places. I welcome the various air programmes and the targets set down for wind power but they are pitifully modest compared to the potential which exists. They will not significantly reduce our current Kyoto liability. From the point of view of the investment itself, from the point of view of economic sense, one cannot get a better investment because it is completely free once the plant is up and running.</P>
    <P>Nationally we have 300 megawatts of electricity being produced from wind and other sources but if we look at Denmark, which does not have the same wind capacity, they have over 1,000 megawatts. In Germany, again without our wind <Col N="404" /> potential, 2,000 megawatts is produced. In Denmark 8,000 people are employed on wind farms alone, not including the backup services. From the point of view of geothermal energy, we are only beginning to realise the potential, while Scandinavia is light years ahead of us. We now have one or two houses constructed as models but this needs to be vigorously promoted. We have been very slow to realise its potential. We have perhaps wallowed in the belief that because we do not have radiant sunshine all year long we do not have any capacity or potential for solar energy but it has been proven to be otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the introduction of domestic audits for energy efficiency in the same way as they have been introduced for companies. The provision of home energy surveys with advice for people on how their houses are leaking energy would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>I wish to correct the Minister on one point. He referred to the pipeline to the west. I very much welcome the investment but it is actually a pipeline from the west as we are going to supply the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Jim Higgins that this Bill should not be rushed through this House using the guillotine several months after it has passed through the Seanad. It demonstrates the low priority that this Government has for the issue of sustainable energy and indeed the low priority that the Government accords to what is now supposed to be national policy &ndash; the national climate change strategy.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister of State has been doing that and, if anything, that reinforces the point I am making. I do not doubt the personal commitment of the Minister of State and am aware of the many personal statements and initiatives he has taken and I commend him for it, but it is indicative of the extent to which the Government to which he belongs does not regard this as a serious issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill has eventually arrived. The Labour Party is supporting the Bill and we welcome the opportunity of debating it. This affords us the time to debate the policy framework from which this Bill emerges, which is Ireland's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and the national climate change strategy which arises from that. It is appropriate that we should be discussing this on 11 December because it is four years to the day that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government returned from Kyoto to address this House on the outcome of the Kyoto talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to take a very serious rain check, if that is not a pun in this context, on the Kyoto Protocol. This country is either not going to meet <Col N="405" /> its commitments or very dramatic changes will have to occur in our consumption patterns, transport and how our industry and economy operate. Unfortunately this &ldquo;good news Government&rdquo; has not communicated that message to the public or to the participants in our economy. I believe there has been an official commitment to Kyoto, which is articulated in official statements from some Ministers in the publication of various documents like the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy and in the initiatives that we are undertaking here today which is the statutory establishment of the Irish Energy Centre. In reality what is happening is that the bad news about Kyoto is being kept from the public. The challenges of Kyoto are so heavily disguised that very few know what is really being talked about and on top of that we have some Ministers and some Departments who, frankly, are going in the opposite direction to the commitments which were given in Kyoto.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect on what the Minister for the Environment and Local Government brought in here on 11 December 1997 when he returned from Kyoto. I was interested to hear Deputy Higgins putting such strong emphasis on emissions trading as a means by which we would reach our Kyoto commitments. Four years ago the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was less than enthusiastic about what he described as the additional flexibilities in terms of the protocol, which he said could dilute the commitment to real action to reduce emissions. Probably the most substantial contribution which has been made to our commitments has been through afforestation. Four years ago the Minister said that while sinks will help some parties to meet their targets it must be recognised that they cannot provide a long-term offset against continuing emissions from fossil fuels. He was even more sceptical in regard to emissions trading. He said that provision for emissions trading was a crucial element for several parties but during all stages of the negotiations the EU sought to ensure that trading would not become a major loophole and that the requirements for trading may only be supplemental to domestic action and so on. What now appears to be the reality is that those flexibilities and those loopholes, as they were then described, are the lifebuoy which the Government is now grasping in order to save some remnants of its commitments to the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>It took three years, from 1997, for the Government to produce its national climate change strategy. Last week in the House I again asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about our progress in regard to the strategy. The agreed target for Ireland was 13% in 2010 on our greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. The Minister replied that the EPA projected on a number of occasions that if we continued on a business as usual scenario we would reach a level in excess of 37% rather than the level of 13% plus in 1990. He further stated that the current level was 20% <Col N="406" /> plus on the 1990 figures. I pressed him on the issue and again he stated that the estimation, which is based on many assumptions &ndash; one being that economic growth continues at the same level &ndash; is that the level will be in the range 34-37% rather than 13%. We have to achieve 13% in 2010 but the business as usual scenario shows us running at about three times that rate. This is not an abstract issue that can be postponed to some future date. There is a requirement under the Kyoto Protocol that we show demonstrable progress by 2005, which is only three years away. We are not going to have demonstrable progress by 2005 because the Government, just as it did in the budget last week where it postponed the financial management of the country and borrowed from next year in financial terms, is also doing so in environmental terms in regard to our commitment under the national climate change strategy. It also borrows from next year in environmental terms and in terms of our commitments under the national climate change strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Renewable energy meets 6% of our needs and will meet 12% by 2005. Europe requires us to meet 13.2% of our needs from renewable energy by 2010, so we are ahead of target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not doing so well by comparison with other EU countries. Sweden meets approximately 27% of its needs from renewable energy while Austria meets 24%. While we are making progress, we are still primarily dependent on fossil fuels for our energy and are more heavily dependent on these than most other European countries. Furthermore, we are much more heavily dependent on oil and gas for our energy supply than was the case in 1980. In terms of our import dependence on energy sources, in 1990, 70% of our energy requirement was imported whereas by 1998 it had increased to more than 80%. The comparable figure in the EU was less than 50%.</P>
      <P>Energy comprises by far the biggest proportion of our greenhouse emissions. Over the past decade our energy consumption has increased by almost 30% while our CO2 emissions from energy has increased by 30%. Over the same period there has been a dramatic increase in CO2 emissions on a <i>per capita</i> basis. The year 1990 is the base year for the climate change strategy and the Kyoto Protocol. In that year the ratio of CO2 emissions on a <i>per capita</i> basis was approximately the same as for the rest of the EU. Over the past decade there has been a slight decrease in CO2 emissions in the EU on a <i>per capita</i> basis whereas emissions in this country have increased by approximately 25%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> It is estimated that on a business as usual basis, CO2 emissions from transport, by far the biggest contributor in terms of increase, will rise by 157% by 2010 while the increases from industry will be 56% and 19% from the housing or residential sector, which is already the biggest component. How will this process be reversed? The Green Paper on sustainable energy is couched in language which suggests that while there is an official policy objective to reach the targets, it is intended to be reached without upsetting anybody. For example, the section dealing with residential consumers and the non-commercial public sector and small businesses advised it is intended to negotiate changes via social partnership arrangements on a progressive basis between now and 2008. Three years ago we heard the same from the Minister for Finance. For example, he then told the House in his Budget Statement that there would be discussions with the social partners on the issue of green taxes. If these have taken place we have not heard. Certainly, no conclusions have emerged. The section dealing with climate change policy in this year's budget amounted to no more than an increase of 6 cent per litre for low sulphur diesel.</P>
    <P>Government policy on green or fuel taxation is to keep talking but act only if it does not upset anybody. It is estimated that the biggest increase in CO2 emissions will occur in the transport sector. Official Government policy is to provide for vehicle efficiency standards and labelling, thus enabling consumers to make informed decisions about energy efficient vehicles. We are all for that. The Green Paper says that Government policy on land use planning is to allow higher density development close to or in existing urban centres along main transport corridors and to reduce the requirement on people to travel, especially by private car. Yet, of the 46,000 houses built in the country last year, 18,000 were one-off dwellings, mostly in the countryside.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that there should not be housing development in the countryside. However, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with responsibility for rural development, Deputy Ó Cuív, is running a campaign in the media to the effect that it is good that houses should be built on every boreen in the country. That is in total conflict with Government policy on reducing greenhouse emissions from the use of transport.</P>
    <P>Road pricing is another element in the Government's policy. The biggest component of the national development plan is to build more roads. Is it the Government's policy to spend money building them and then charge commuters so that they will not use them? These policies are incompatible. How is it proposed to promote cheap public transport in a city that is completely gridlocked with traffic? The Government's biggest contribution to public transport in the city was to delay the implementation of the DTO strategy by <Col N="408" /> three to four years when it decided that parts of the Luas light rail system should be put under ground. This week alone, the board of CIE decided it will transfer 40% of its rail business from rail to road. It is not possible to have an official Government policy promoting cheap public transport and reducing the transport component of greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time permitting a State owned company to shift freight from rail, which is supposed to be encouraged, to road, which will have a negative impact on traffic and on the rate of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>The net position is that we have a commitment to the Kyoto protocols, in theory, but the Government has no intention of implementing them or, at the very least, intends to postpone implementation until after a general election. We need a new statement from Government, at this point, as to how those targets will be achieved. We are very wide of the mark in terms of the targets we signed up to and we are way off-beam from the national climate change strategy document which was agreed. For example, has the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development talked to the farming organisations about reducing the national herd by 10%, which is one of the commitments in the climate change strategy? What will be done with Moneypoint? There is an ambiguous statement about that in the climate change strategy document but we have no clear statement from Government as to what will be done in relation to Moneypoint or in key areas, such as energy conservation and building regulations. It has been recommended to Government for quite some time that the use of the nine inch cavity block should be discontinued in the interests of energy conservation, in line with the views of most people in the construction industry and professionals in the energy conservation sector. The Government has still not acted on that because there is significant interest in the manufacture of those blocks and, to date, the Government has responded more positively to that interest than to the need to conserve energy.</P>
    <P>In the debate in this House, immediately following the Kyoto agreement in 1997, one of the measures advocated at that time by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, as a means of meeting our targets was the national recycling strategy and the new Waste Management Act. We know what has happened to the Waste Management Act of 1996 &ndash; it simply has not been implemented. We now see alarming discoveries, on a daily basis, of illegal dumps. There is no coherent waste management strategy. With regard to recycling, the allocation of £11 million &ndash; a relatively small sum &ndash; last year for grant-aiding recycling projects was not spent. Only £3 million of it was spent. On each of the targets set in the climate change strategy and on all the main headings of our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, we are simply not meeting them and there is very little indication that we will meet those targets by 2010.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> I am glad the Irish Energy Centre is being established on a statutory basis. However, I was curious about one section in the Minister of State's address today and perhaps he might clarify it when he is responding. It referred to the transfer of staff and the arrangements being made in that regard, and it contained a lot of coded text. He said: &ldquo;It is only to be expected that some staff might have concerns in relation to these issues . . .&rdquo; and so on. He referred to the establishment of a consultative forum which is meeting regularly and said that &ldquo;with the necessary dialogue and goodwill on all sides, these matters can be resolved to the satisfaction of the existing staff.&rdquo; I do not wish to involve myself or this House in the normal discussions that would take place on such an issue but I translate this paragraph as saying the staff are against the proposition. The Minister of State should tell us if there is an issue here. It is one thing to establish the agency on a statutory basis but if its establishment subsequently runs into industrial relations difficulties, the high aspirations contained in both the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and the Minister of State's speech, may not be met.</P>
    <P>On the specific provisions of the Bill, I was curious about a couple of issues and I ask the Minister of State to address them. In relation to membership of the board of the centre, it is generally accepted that Members of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament are not eligible for appointment as members of the board. However, there seems to be a new addition to this category in this Bill, namely, that a person who is a member of a local authority shall be disqualified from becoming a member of the board. The exclusion of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament is now quite common in relation to State agencies and I have no argument with that, but the addition of membership of a local authority seems to cast the net much more widely than has been the case up to now. Perhaps the Minister of State will explain what is so significant about the Irish Energy Centre that members of a local authority could not be eligible to serve on its board.</P>
    <P>I am also curious about section 18 in relation to the disclosure of information. I accept that, in any agency, there are rules governing disclosure of confidential or sensitive information. However, the way in which section 18 is constructed appears to widen the restriction on the provision of information to the public by members of the board, the chief executive or the staff of the agency. Confidential information is defined in the Bill as information that is expressed by the board or by a committee of the board to be confidential. That is an issue. One of the main functions of the Irish Energy Centre, as is clear in the Bill, is the provision of information to the public. If there is a prohibition on staff or board members of the agency providing information, on the basis of a very restrictive definition of &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo;, that will inhibit the provision of infor<Col N="410" /> mation and will ultimately interfere with the work of the agency and its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is supporting this Bill and we will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage. We greatly regret that the Government appears to have turned its back on the Kyoto Protocol and on the national climate change strategy which it published only a year ago. Just as it has done in the context of the budget and the financial management of the country, the Government has simply stored up trouble for the future in relation to the environmental management of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill follows on from the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy introduced in September 1999, which set out to ensure that the energy needs of the current generation could be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs and which set quite a difficult target in that regard. It is a worthy and commendable aim, but I cannot help believing it is somewhat patronising to assume that future generations will be unable to find or invent new sources of energy for themselves. On the other hand, the climate change effects of the use of energy are enormous and the difficulties posed for the environment by greenhouse gases need to be addressed independently of other considerations.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the Bill is to allow the Irish Energy Centre to operate independently of Enterprise Ireland and become the sustainable energy authority of Ireland. One of the tasks the new authority will face will be to address our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. A sustainable energy policy should ensure security of energy supply in order to support economic and social development while protecting the environment. It has become clear recently that it is difficult to supply our electricity requirements and the ESB has had to find sources from outside the country to supplement the available supply. That was a difficult task. The new authority will also have to maximise the efficiency of generation, emphasise the use of renewable resources and promote energy conservation by users. In its short existence, the Irish Energy Centre has had particular success in the latter area and ordinary people have become aware of the need to conserve energy, not just because of the costs involved but because of the damage that can be done to the environment. The final aim of the new authority will be to minimise emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants by promoting clean generation and sustainable consumption levels in all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new authority will also be obliged to maintain local air quality and limit and reduce the Irish contribution to regional and local environmental problems. I assume it will be given the resources to allow it to provide monitoring centres in various locations throughout the country which will allow it to monitor air quality. The <Col N="411" /> latter is one of the most important considerations which must be taken into account when looking at people's quality of life.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre was established in 1995 under Forbairt and has had a considerable impact on the efficient use of energy during the intervening period. It has also managed to attract considerable private sector investment into desirable developments.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to limit energy related CO2 emissions without there being a dramatic increase in the use of renewable energy sources. In that context, a previous speaker suggested the use of localised energy production within or close to huge demand locations such as industrial estates in which there is a considerable excess and waste of energy. The new authority will face up to this task and will be proactive in facilitating developments in this area. There will be a need to bring together diverse interests, some of which will be in competition with each other, in order for progress to be made. The prospects for success in this area are good.</P>
    <P>It is notoriously difficult to gain planning permission for wind farm projects. The Minister of State has sought to support the provision of wind energy, but objections are frequently made when wind farms are proposed. It is interesting that, in many cases, the objectors are those who are most vocal on other green issues. I accept that there are difficulties for people living near wind farms because they are extremely unsightly and noisy and many complaints are made about them. One can sympathise with and support the objections of those who live near wind farms. However, one might take a more cynical view of the activities of those who call for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the use of renewable resources, on one hand, while spending an inordinate amount of time, energy and resources fighting attempts to provide alternatives, on the other.</P>
    <P>At least two previous speakers referred to the Moneypoint generating station. One of the proposals relating to the station is that it should be converted from using coal to using gas. This would have huge implications in terms of employment levels at the station. There is a large trained and committed work force in place there at present and if these people's jobs were to be wiped out by a State authority &ndash; which seems likely under the proposal to convert to gas &ndash; alternative sources of employment should be planned for and provided, either on-site or in the immediate vicinity. I have grave reservations about a policy that will address one problem, in this case the emissions from the station, while contemporaneously creating a major social problem, namely, unemployment. It is possible to do both and responsibility for this lies with the State agencies. I do not want to see one State agency proceeding with an initiative of which another is well aware and in respect of which it could already be working actively to address.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> The effects of emissions from Moneypoint on Scandinavia, the Scottish highlands and elsewhere were referred to by previous speakers. When I was a member of Clare County Council, I frequently raised my concerns about the possible effects of such emissions on the Burren. The ESB has a station in the Burren where it monitors these emissions. I am sure this is quite proper and above board but it does not increase one's confidence in the system when monitoring is carried out and supervised by the body likely to be the cause of the emissions. At one stage and over a period of three to four years, the county council provided an independent benchmarking study of lichen growth in one of the uppermost areas of the Burren. Unfortunately, however, when resources became scarce eight or nine years ago it was one of the initiatives that were dropped. I understand the original study material is still available at the county council's offices and it would be worthwhile to consult this data and, on the basis of it, conduct a further two or three year study into the effects, if any, on lichen growth. Lichen is the most sensitive organism in the Burren area and is also the most likely to show the effects of any deterioration or changes in air quality which might have occurred.</P>
    <P>While the debate is raging as to whether Moneypoint should be converted into a gas powered station, the option of providing scrubbers should be given more serious consideration than has been the case heretofore. This has been dismissed out of hand on the basis of cost. I accept that the costs involved would be substantial but we must bear in mind that coal is likely to be cheap and readily available for some time. The cost of providing scrubbers as against that of converting to gas might not be as unattractive when viewed in that context as opposed to its being considered in isolation. At a minimum, the authority should involve itself in deciding on which is the better option. We must also take account of whether the alternative sources are reliable, readily available, less damaging to the environment than coal and not likely to be better utilised elsewhere. The latter should be included in the equation when considering the impact of conversion on natural gas supplies because there is potential for massive use of natural gas at Moneypoint and, perhaps, at other planned stations.</P>
    <P>While the debate about the future of the station tends to rage on occasion and then lie dormant, nothing is being done about extending its capacity to add extra electricity to the national grid. It is time the debate on the future power source used at the station was concluded and that its potential to provide even more electricity, as originally planned, should be explored and acted upon.</P>
    <P>Under the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland agreed to limit gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. The Kyoto agreement was signed in 1996 when, one assumes, the Minister did not expect the huge level of subsequent growth in the economy and the consequent demand for energy. I understand <Col N="413" /> that greenhouse gas emissions are approximately 20% above 1990 levels. In 1990, energy related greenhouse gases accounted for 55% of total emissions and by 2010 they are likely to account for 63% of these.</P>
    <P>The national climate change strategy of 2000 provoked a debate on the causes of such change. I recall that a number of experts seriously undermined current theories about the causes and effects of greenhouse gas emissions. The authority needs to bear in mind that there are very powerful interests involved in energy production which it will have to take on. The Minister's description of the work of the authority as a mammoth task was certainly accurate. On a much more modest level, the solid fuel industry has objected in recent weeks to the proposals in the discussion document currently with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government and has mounted a very strong lobby to continue to be able to sell coal and petroleum coke. That is an example of the difficulties the authority is likely to face in addressing the question of emissions down the line.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility of introducing building regulations to make houses and other buildings much more energy efficient. However, the attendant costs make them unattractive in a climate where the cost of providing new houses is virtually prohibitive for many couples. Such a policy may be glibly trotted out, but it needs to be thought through and if its implications involve extra costs and the State is causing such costs to accrue, the State clearly has an obligation to address that.</P>
    <P>We are committed to dramatically improving our public service infrastructure. During a debate in Private Members' time weeks ago the Minister outlined the huge level of spending on the public transport infrastructure and the large number of extra vehicles that have been provided. Simultaneously, many Members argued that there had been little impact on the overall situation and that if any impact was to be achieved huge additional financial resources would have to be provided for public transport. It will be necessary to make judgments and choices about where money can best be spent in terms of the debate being conducted here today.</P>
    <P>There have also been attempts to introduce a taxation policy which favours green energy use. There seems to be some scope in the area of, for example, private motor cars and electrical goods. I would not anticipate a huge level of objection and it would have the potential to impact quite appreciably.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a debate between An Taisce and the Minister of State on land use policy. Throughout rural Ireland the vast majority of people favour the viewpoint of the Minister of State in that regard. However, as Deputy Gilmore said, a very substantial number of one-off dwellings have been built in rural Ireland over the past year or two. Perhaps we have missed an <Col N="414" /> opportunity here. There could be a requirement that a minimum area of plantation be produced on half-acre sites. That would certainly improve the visual amenity and would, over a period, contribute considerably to the afforestation programme. That is an idea that could be examined in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Many people outside this House are saying publicly and privately that we signed up to daft targets in the Kyoto Protocol. It is very fashionable in some quarters to attack President Bush for his denunciation of the protocol. However, there are many who think he is a lot closer to reality than some of those who are promoting the targets of the protocol. The Minister outlined the EU position. Ireland is committed to that position and it is certainly what we would like to achieve. However, an element of realism needs to be incorporated into the debate if we are to reach these targets. There are implications for spending policy that must be faced up to.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas itself has demonstrated some of the lack of action about which Deputy Gilmore complained. This Dáil dropped the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development; it is currently a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government. It has no dedicated staff and there is no support available for the members of the sub-committee. It is very difficult, therefore, for the sub-committee to do its work and for the Oireachtas to hold Departments to account in the way it is required to. Some of the meetings at which Secretaries General and senior officials of Departments made presentations on sustainable development were very instructive. In some cases the attitude would induce pessimism and depression in anyone who was committed to moving us towards the targets of the Kyoto Protocol. I could not help thinking that if this is the attitude in some of the Departments, who could blame ordinary people if they have difficulty in facing up to the commitments in the Kyoto Protocol and the Government's programme.</P>
    <P>While the sustainable energy policy must ensure that we do our own business, it should also independently monitor and take action on factors outside the State. I refer particularly to the situation at Sellafield. It would be a move in the right direction if the authority were given the right not only to monitor and study effects on the air in Ireland but also to move independently in the courts at European level rather than having the Government do it. It would be of enormous benefit if the required action could be taken at this level. It is not clear from what the Minister said or from a reading of the Bill how much power the authority will have in relation to independent Departments. It must have the right to call Departments to account for their policies, practices and procedures. Not having that right would constitute a very great weakness in its operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and the setting up of the authority. It has a hugely important role to <Col N="415" /> play in the Ireland of the new millennium and I trust it will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Crawford and Sargent.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is important that we move forward in this area and establish procedures to develop alternative, renewable and sustainable sources of energy. Fine Gael supports this Bill and I look forward to more detailed discussions on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Kyoto Protocol under which we have agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. However, currently our greenhouse gas emissions are about 20% above 1990 levels and rising. I questioned the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on this issue last week with particular reference to the budget. The reply was that under the Government's national climate change strategy, published in 2000, we would see the introduction of energy taxes and so on in the budget, but the budget contained no measures aimed at reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases. This is very disappointing. In 1997 we had a debate in this House following the signing of the Kyoto Protocol. Nothing has changed since. We have not made any progress. The Government's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is, therefore, questionable.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to establishing renewable sources of energy. I was heartened to hear that we are on target to meet our requirements in that area. That is very positive. However, we are behind in meeting our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The Minister confirmed today that energy related greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 and that if we continue as we are, that will increase to 63% by 2010. This is very serious for us. We have legally binding commitments. The Kyoto Protocol is a global commitment. We are committed with our EU partners to meet greenhouse gas emission targets. It is worth noting that Ireland did well under that agreement<i> vis-à-vis</i> our EU partners, in that Ireland is allowed to increase its emission levels while other countries had to reduce them. That is recognition that our economy is developing. We do not have nuclear power, thankfully. However, our economic growth is proceeding at a rapid rate and that is having an effect on our emissions.</P>
      <P>There are many opportunities and options available to the Government, as have been outlined in the climate change strategy. It is necessary, however, to see some commitment on policy on the Government's part rather than another publication being produced to gather dust on a shelf. This issue is, and will be, a challenge for us. Nobody said it would be easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins outlined our party's proposals to deal with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. They include converting <Col N="416" /> Moneypoint from coal to natural gas and only giving licences to electricity generating plants that are not using renewable sources of energy if they are 80% efficient. We would introduce green credits for savings in electricity. It is also essential to set targets of energy output to be derived from renewable energy sources by 2010. I will not list all the elements of our policy but it is important that some measures are put in place immediately because our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is questionable.</P>
    <P>Ireland has access to vast wind energy. It is the main renewable source that comes to mind. It is a valuable source of energy and as an island nation we have huge potential to develop it. We are aware of the objections that arise locally, which are understandable. Nevertheless, it is important that we move forward in this regard. When I was a student in university I studied wind and wave energy. There is tremendous potential in both but, unfortunately, the use of wave energy has not advanced. We can learn from our European partners about using wind energy. Denmark, Norway and Sweden utilise this valuable resource. It is a free and renewable source of energy and does not require fossil fuel. Ireland is 86% dependent on imported fossil fuels, something that must be addressed if the country is to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>I regret there has been so little time to debate the Bill and this important topic. Many Members of my party would have liked to contribute to the debate. The main point which must be emphasised is our lack of progress in meeting our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill. I have been involved in efforts to get biomass production off the ground over the past eight years. I regret the time limit on this debate but I welcome the Minister of State's statement that he is a great believer in the role of renewable energy. Unfortunately, that has not been turned into actual supply.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he will allow increased borrowing to facilitate the upgrading and expansion of the gas pipeline to the west and for the second interconnector to Scotland. There is no gas pipeline in north Monaghan which puts the area at a huge disadvantage. The towns of Ballybay, Castleblayney, Clones and Monaghan do not have the advantage of connection to the gas pipeline, unlike Carrickmacross and other towns in Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only 2.5% of our energy comes from renewable sources. In 1995, Sweden generated 25.4% of its energy from those sources. Denmark generates 1,500 megawatts of energy from wind power. Spain generates 2,500 megawatts and Germany generates 6,000 megawatts from the same source. Ireland generates only 95 megawatts even though it has the best wind speeds in Europe. I am aware that there are planning problems and so forth but we need to quickly get to a situation where we <Col N="417" /> utilise our single cheapest energy resource to the full.</P>
    <P>A new directive is due from the EU which suggests that we must produce 12% of our energy from renewable sources by 2010. The EU alternate report says we could supply approximately 40% of our energy from renewable sources A total of 15% of the world's energy requirements are satisfied by biomass, which arises from wood or agri-waste. Energy from biomass has advantages as it replaces energy that would otherwise be generated using fossil fuels. Biomass, therefore, would reduce carbon emissions.</P>
    <P>On three occasions I have visited a biomass plant in Scunthorpe in the United Kingdom. On one of those visits I accompanied the then Minister, Deputy Stagg. That was more than five years ago. The plant uses chicken and turkey litter. It is located in an industrial estate beside a chocolate factory and adjacent to a village. Under three different AER programmes, a similar proposal for north Monaghan failed to be chosen through the competition although few, if any, of the winners went ahead. Through the fifth programme, direct from Brussels, the same company has now received its licence and agreed to supply the grid.</P>
    <P>This type of biomass plant can supply both heat and power. In real terms, the main benefit for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and the Border area is that it will use as fuel poultry litter and mushroom compost, substances which have been causing serious problems not only for farmers but for the environment. Two thirds of the poultry in Ireland are produced in County Monaghan, as are two thirds of the mushrooms. There is a need for an urgent move forward on this project because neither poultry producers nor mushroom farmers can get planning permission to upgrade their premises, let alone extend them. An industry that is stagnant can die. There is also import substitution when a product cannot be provided economically at home. A biomass plant could solve that problem and allow the restructuring and extension of poultry and mushroom units.</P>
    <P>There are genuine fears but also an element of scaremongering about this. It is a major issue for my region. There are fears among local people, which is only natural. People worry about the unknown. However, there is also serious scaremongering. Unfortunately, even some of the local media, who have been offered free transport to see a plant of a similar nature in Scotland, refuse to avail of that opportunity yet they write pages and pages about the dangers.</P>
    <P>There is a need for education and for a full effort by Government to ensure both wind and biomass energy are fully utilised in the next few years. The lack of energy in some areas is also a problem that must be taken into account. If alternative energy was available in local areas it could provide the impetus for other types of production and industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic. As we approach the Finance Bill, I urge the Government to ensure that proper taxation <Col N="418" /> structures are put in place to allow those who would be interested in investing in alternative energies to do so in the same way as those in towns are allowed to invest in housing.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas le Fine Gael as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt. Tugaim faoi deara go bhfuil roinnt leasaithe sa leagan is déanaí den mBille um Fhuinneamh Inmharthana, 2001. Tagann na leasuithe sin ón tSeanad agus cuirim fáilte rompu. Ach tá gá le tuilleadh leasaithe. With regard to amendments, there is a need to reduce the Minister for Finance's veto which exists in the Bill. The Minister has shown through this year's budget that he is an enemy of sustainability and he should not have power, or the axe, over members of the board of Sustainable Energy Ireland at this stage. The Minister for Finance needs to make a Road to Damascus conversion on sustainability. He has not allowed any reduction in VAT for renewable energy, for example, and there are many other problems, from an environmental perspective, with which he seems unable to cope.</P>
      <P>Tá gá le gníomhú de réir ár mbriathra chomh maith. The Government needs to be clear about its wish to dismantle the Euratom treaty when it comes up for review, and should not allow the treaty continue in its present form. It continues to fund nuclear power and starve renewable energy of similar funding. That is the situation in the European Union, of which we are a part.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to the Kyoto Protocol has been shameful. In 1997, we were given an allowance to increase our bubble above 1990 levels. One year later, in 1998, we had already broken through that bubble and were forging ahead towards the cliff. In 2000, we were up 20% over 1990 levels and there is now speculation that we may be two to three times too high when it comes to the cut-off point in 2010 or 2012, whichever year is decided on for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killeen said it will cost money to have sustainability. It will cost much more not to be sustainable. The Kyoto Protocol will be a serious and sore sting in the tail for this and succeeding Governments if they fail to get to grips with our runaway greenhouse gases. Already, more people suffer in this country through fuel poverty than in any other EU member state. The poor will suffer most because of the failure of this and previous Governments to ensure energy insulation in buildings, whether old or new but particularly older buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The test for this Government, and the next, will be whether Ireland adopts the report which Energy Action commissioned in 1999 entitled Houses for the 21st Century.  It is not too extreme to say that comprehensive report will save lives. It will also save a large amount of money, as I mentioned regarding the Kyoto Protocol and insulation, and will improve the quality of life for many, particularly the elderly in our community. The Government is talking about this but needs to act to have credibility. This is not a <Col N="419" /> debate about <i>ad hoc</i> actions and implementing that report would make for a very good start. This is not like having a particular event such as the Millennium celebrations, marked by a ribbon-cutting ceremony, but a debate based on scientific research. It is about the challenge to live within the limits which have been defined for us, not by any Government, but by the natural world which sustains us.</P>
    <P>I am glad the word &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; is used in the Bill because it is a much abused term. Perhaps it needs to be understood by using a metaphor. The metaphor I would like to use is that of the &ldquo;ecological footprint.&rdquo; At last, by using this term, we have a way of expressing &ndash; and measuring &ndash; our impact on the natural world. At the latest computation, the &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; of the average Irish person covered 5.9 hectares of the planet's biologically productive area, or more than three times our fair share of the globe's resources. Since the world's population started soaring towards 10 billion &ndash; a figure at present trends only a little more than 30 years away &ndash; the application of an ecological carrying capacity to the human global habitat has grown more and more compelling.</P>
    <P>It underpins the whole notion of sustainability agreed by the Irish Government at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. From it has evolved a measure of the area of land and sea needed to produce the food and resources we use, and to absorb the wastes we create. The planet's total productive area works out at roughly two hectares per person. Allowing 12 % to protect the rest of the species in the world &ndash; not enough, but that figure has been proposed by the scientific community &ndash; we are left with 1.7 hectares per head available for human use.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this Government's term in office in 1997, the average human &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; was already 35 % bigger than nature could regenerate on a continuous basis, and growing fast. In that year, in the Sustainable Development Strategy for Ireland prepared for Government, UCD's environmental institute used four measures of domestic consumption &ndash; fossil fuels, built-up land, food and forestry &ndash; to arrive at an Irish ecological footprint of 2.38 hectares per person, or a total of 86,325 square kilometres. We are living with the assumption that we have 1.25 times the size of the State at our disposal. We are dumping and exploiting other countries to maintain the quality of life we enjoy here.</P>
    <P>Other countries need to be looked at. India, Pakistan, China and Egypt are among the very few countries which consume at a level well within the planet's life support capacity. The United States, predictably, has a monstrous &ldquo;footprint&rdquo;&ndash; 10.3 hectares per person, or almost twice the area needed by the average west European. Ireland comes in at 5.9 hectares, on a level with Sweden and more than half a hectare ahead of the UK.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> This is not a debate about efforts, tokens or back-slapping concerning what the Government has done or promises to do; the budget is no great example of the Government's seriousness in this regard. It is an opportunity to evaluate and compare, strictly and scientifically, where we stand with regard to other countries, but more importantly where we stand in terms of our global impact and how we, as a sovereign State, use resources that are not ours. We need to face that challenge and to report back on how we are getting on. We are getting worse. That has to change. Let us reverse that trend and ensure that we will, at least in years to come, become sustainable. We are a long way from that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this very important debate. It is probably one of the most important debates in the House this year, and perhaps for a number of years to come. It is disappointing, however, that the debate is being guillotined in three short hours and being held at this time, on this day, in this week. It should have been held earlier in the year, or perhaps at a different time when more Deputies were present and more interest could have been generated. The Minister said he looked forward to an interesting debate on this most important issue. It is a pity that more people will not be able to contribute. We are talking about the future of our country, our planet, and civilisation when we discuss energy levels and the impact misuse of energy is having, and can have, on the future of our planet and on our lives.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill which has been published for quite some time and which has gone through the Seanad. This Bill, which is very important, sets up the Irish Energy Centre as a statutory agency and gives it all kinds of responsibilities and powers. It is important that we, in this House, support the proposed work of the centre. There is, however, more to it than that. We, as elected representatives, have to lead the people. We have to talk about changing the national mindset. We have to get people to think about conserving energy and about alternative sources of energy. I noticed recently that we had an energy awareness week. We should have an energy awareness year and not just a week &ndash; it should be ongoing and should gain momentum. All the people have to be educated on how energy can be conserved and used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems we could face are horrendous. We import 70% to 80% of our energy needs and yet we could generate so much more. From an economic point of view, we could do much to improve the situation. We know the way the economy is going and we have seen how international incidents can affect oil supplies. We are very dependent on foreign energy. There could be a double benefit to us if we developed sustainable energy in that we would help our environment and our balance of payments. We would also create employment for our people. There are <Col N="421" /> many advantages to developing these forms of energy.</P>
    <P>I am critical of many aspects as well. For instance, house building is an area to which we should start to turn our attention where energy conservation, use and misuse are concerned. We do not emphasise enough the need to develop and put in place building practices and regulations to ensure energy is conserved. Simple things &ndash; for example, south facing windows &ndash; attract the sun. I am told that in the summer, all the heating requirements of a house could be generated from solar heat alone and yet, as far as I am aware, there are no incentives, supports or advice for people who might wish to develop solar energy in that way &ndash; for example, heating water on the roof of a house.</P>
    <P>We should be able to develop biomass to a greater extent. People in Sweden, Denmark and Austria use wood burning stoves. We know of the effect that has because timber is a renewable source of energy, the carbon sync is replenished and we do not add to the problems of carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases and so on. This country is well suited to growing timber of all varieties. Willow coppicing is something on which we should start to work and develop. There is another advantage to doing that because our farmers are under pressure and if we can develop bio-energy crops for agriculture, it will assist them as well. We should start to look down that road in a big way.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the only part of this Bill which is important is section 6 &ndash; the functions of the authority. The rest of the Bill is standard and sets up the new agency. While it can be looked at, section 6 is the one we really have to consider. There is nothing in it about which one could quibble. It is important that this agency is given the resources and the authority to drive the functions it will be given by the Minister and the Oireachtas when the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I began by talking about changing the mindset of the people. I ask the Minister to ensure this happens straightaway and that advertisements are placed, television programmes are made and programmes are developed for schools &ndash; I know a certain about of work has been done on that already &ndash; so that the mindset of our people is changed and that they do simple things like turning off lights and heating and turning down thermostats to conserve energy.</P>
    <P>I spoke about building new houses but we also have to look at older houses to see how they can be adapted to conserve energy. I am talking about isolating cavity walls and pumping foam into them to ensure heat loss is minimised and ensuring double glazing is used, especially in older houses. Money for some of the schemes to assist older people in replacing old windows and doors has run out this year. There is major heat loss from the homes of some older people thus causing discomfort to them. I refer to the essential repair grant scheme, for example, and the <Col N="422" /> other schemes administered by the county councils and the health boards.</P>
    <P>It is also important that finance is set aside for research. Wind energy has been developed to a large extent. There are issues around wind energy &ndash; for example, the visual aspect of the windmills to which, I think, people are getting used. We have another massive resource around our coastline &ndash; wave and tidal energy. Programmes are being developed and experiments and research are being done in some of the universities in this area. This is an area into which we have to put more resources and provide more support. We are surrounded by some of the wildest seas in Europe. If we can generate a fraction of that power, it would be to our advantage.</P>
    <P>We all know of the importance of hydro-electricity. I am not totally convinced that it is used to its full potential. There is potential for smaller schemes to be developed around the country and it might be useful if some research was carried out to see if that could be done. There are old mills and old mill-races around the country which are not used. Perhaps we should investigate to see if, with modern technology, they could be converted into places in which hydro-electricity could be generated. Heat converters are another form of energy. It is expensive to do this initially but it is something at which we should look. I have been told, for instance, that if one places pipes under a garden with water flowing to a heat converter, one can raise the temperature of water in a house to heat radiators and so on by a substantial amount even in winter. We need to be imaginative in how we deal with this area.</P>
    <P>Many agencies, including the Irish Bio-Energy Association and others, have been ploughing lone furrows in this area for many years. It is important that they are supported in the work they do. Some grants have been made available to them but more is needed and perhaps that could be done through this agency.</P>
    <P>The members of the agency should be people with imagination, drive and a proven track record in the area of energy conservation and in the sustainable energy field. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on this Bill. As I said, there is only one major section in it and we are very supportive of it. Not only should the Department of Public Enterprise be involved in this Bill but there should be a cross-Department and Government approach to sustainable energy. For instance, the Department of Environment and Local Government should be involved where building, road use and so on are concerned. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should also be involved; indeed, one could go through all the Departments. All Departments should be linked up. All our policies and legislation should be energy proofed. That would be a good start. I know there is talk of poverty proofing legislation in other areas. I have been told by way of parliamentary reply that Departments do not use any green energy at the moment, that the State itself does not use any green energy. <Col N="423" /> The State should play a lead role in using green energy, conserving power and heat and putting into practice what it preaches. That is quite important.</P>
    <P>We also need to start looking at other forms of energy. The Department of the Environment and Local Government should develop cycle lanes. We have to do this. When we think of sustainable energy forms, we just think about electricity and heating houses. However, a massive amount of energy is used by our modes of transport.</P>
    <P>Across the country people are being dissuaded from using bicycles, which are a green form of transport. Obviously they help people keep fit as well. We have seen horrific accidents here in Dublin in which people have been killed and badly injured while using bicycles. I have called on Ministers and Departments before to develop cycle lanes and pedestrian walkways in cities and rural areas. The countryside is also quite dangerous for cyclists. Many young people and their parents are afraid to cycle on the roads, even in rural Ireland. The roads are too narrow. The traffic is too fast and there is too much of it, making cycling highly dangerous. Therefore, we may need to start considering one-way systems, even in the countryside, so there will be space on the roadways for pedestrians and cyclists. This would encourage people to get out of their cars and start using their bicycles.</P>
    <P>Electric bicycles should also be considered. We must look at how they are taxed and insured. They are insured as motor vehicles whereas they are really bicycles. Other countries have changed regulations to allow people use electric bicycles instead of motor cars and motor cycles.</P>
    <P>All our energy, in some shape or form, comes from the sun. I know we do not have much sunshine here but we get enough of it. Our main forms of energy are coal, oil, etc. Those forms of energy were not exploited for hundreds of millions of years in some cases, but now they are running out. Also, they pose problems from an environmental point of view. We can harness the energy of the sun through wind farms, solar energy, wave power, biotechnology and other means. We should start doing it now.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister of State in bringing forward this Bill, even though it is a bit late. I know he was anxious to bring it forward earlier than this, but parliamentary time did not allow for it. We will certainly support it in every way possible. This is the way of the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most interesting subject. One can fantasise and get carried away. I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in promoting this Bill, which is designed to promote sustainable energy. There were some rather interesting statistics in his statement. However, there are other questions I would like him to answer in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the progress we are making with regard to wind farms. They are <Col N="424" /> the most obvious and significant source of sustainable energy we can have. It strikes me that there is a considerable geographical imbalance in the number of wind farms which have been developed so far. They virtually all seem to be in the north-west or extreme south-west.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes carried away by the fallacy that our country is more beautiful than anywhere else and that our scenery is incomparable. That is not necessarily the case. There are vast tracts of land here that would be very suitable for wind farms. This should be accepted easily. It seems that the protest group syndrome has grown to such an extent that if one wants to do anything it is objected to. This is not just the case with regard to land-fill sites, roadways, motorways or telecommunications masts, but also wind farms. If one suggests that a wind farm be put in one's own locality or county, people rise up in arms and protest and say &ldquo;We cannot have it. You cannot destroy our natural beauty.&rdquo;. We must compromise in every walk of life.</P>
    <P>I see compromises all over the world. For instance, when one goes to Holland or Denmark there are hundreds of wind farms. If one goes to England, one sees a considerable number. However, I was told in a reply to a recent parliamentary question that on a comparative basis, when one takes population and size into account, the number of wind farms in England is much the same as ours. They do not have a huge number. They have some in some areas which would be regarded as highly scenic in this country. If one drives down to Lands End in Cornwall, one of the more scenic counties in England, one will see two very large windmills off the main road on the way. The English are pragmatic. Protest groups are not succeeding in stopping progress everywhere and anywhere.</P>
    <P>Most parts of this country are suitable for wind farms. I would like to see a county by county study of how many applications have been made, how many have succeeded and why progress has not been made in a more general manner. The amount of development so far has been largely in the north-west &ndash; Mayo, Sligo and Donegal &ndash; and I wonder why there has not been any development in the eastern part of the country, where there is ample room for such developments. This is a windswept island. For much of the year, it is miserable. Tens of thousands of people fly off to Spain, Greece and other sunny locations because of the wind and rain here. Rain could be considered as another string in our bow as regards sustainable energy. Rivers and mountain streams afford the possibility of developing hydro-electric schemes on a small basis.</P>
    <P>I know incentives have been provided to people to develop schemes, the terms of which are quite attractive. However, I still do not think the country is aware that we can have more sustainable energy schemes. We can reduce our huge imports of crude oil, coal and fossil fuels in general. It would be nice if the Minister of State put a figure on how much those products cost, as they <Col N="425" /> create greenhouse gasses. It would give the public a start to realise we spend hundreds of millions of pounds on this every year.</P>
    <P>I propose to give five minutes of my time to Deputy Boylan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Ms Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be good to have such a figure as that would strike a note in the public imagination.</P>
      <P>I know a major scheme is planned for the Kish Bank and there are probably more planned for the Wicklow and Wexford coast. What will be their capacity? It is all about capacity. How many such planning applications have been made throughout the country? I refer to reasonable applications and not hare brained schemes. How many such applications have received planning permission and how many have been refused permission by the local authority concerned? Also, in how many cases has planning permission been refused on appeal to An Bord Pleanála? That should be itemised. If something useful is to be done one must get down to the nuts and bolts; I hope the Minister of State takes my point. It is essential to quantify these matters.</P>
      <P>There is not one wind farm in my county. There were attempts to build some but we had bloody murder with the usual protest groups. It seems they won the day, though I am not sure if some applications are still proceeding. I would like to know. I like matters to be itemised on a county basis. I am not so keen on doing that on a regional basis. Perhaps the Minister of State will itemise matters when he replies.</P>
      <P>There has been a reference to other sources of sustainable energy and the development of hydro-electric power should definitely be pursued. The considerable rainfall and hilly terrain in so many parts of Ireland mean there are many fast-flowing streams. Accordingly, hydro-electric schemes would be viable but I do not know if there is sufficient technical knowledge. I do not doubt if the Dutch had our hills they would generate a huge amount of sustainable energy, so much that they would probably not need to import oil or coal. They are an ingenious race, as are the Germans. We are a little slovenly when it comes to this. We are not as imaginative or inventive and we seem to lack the technical ability which western and central Europeans have to a considerable degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State did not mention wave power, though that sector has considerable merit and has been viewed for many years as a viable source of sustainable energy. There is a narrow inlet leading into the back of Tramore Strand called Rhinneshark. The current there when the tide comes in and out is quite ferocious and could surely be used to generate electrical power. There is also constant wave power off the west coast which it should be possible to harness. The Mini<Col N="426" /> ster of State should tell us in his reply if this is being done anywhere in the world. If so, it could be done in Ireland. We have much windier conditions than Holland and Denmark, which have many wind farms. We have the wave power. Even when there is not a puff of wind there is a huge swell off the west coast. Ask any fisherman or anyone in the Naval Service. The sea off the west coast as it is always rough for seagoing. Unfortunately we have yet to devise a system for retaining static electricity. It is amazing with all the Nobel prizewinners and the geniuses coming out of universities around the world that nobody has yet found a method of storing static electricity. Many of our problems would be solved if we could store static electricity rather than depending on generating electricity.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to his objective of using sustainable energy to fuel the energy needs of 180,000 homes. He should quantify how many such domestic homes there are in the country. Should it not be possible at least to meet the electricity needs of every domestic user in each county by sustainable energy? That is a simple objective to aim for &ndash; that every county would have enough sustainable energy to supply domestic needs. It should be a goal of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State give a break down of how the various fuels are used to generate electricity? For example, how much power do we need for domestic use, for industrial use, transport, street lighting and so on? It is all about quantifying these matters. If one wants to solve a problem one must identify it. I want these issues quantified and a better effort made.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is doing a very good job in this sphere. He is trying but the public at large does not understand the incentives that are available, such as the various grants. We are not getting the message across at local level that much more can be done at that level as well as at a national level. I want a break down of the figures.</P>
    <P>The best of luck to the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for sharing his time with me and I echo his good wishes for the Minister of State, who is doing an excellent job. We wish him well in his campaign against the British Government and Sellafield. He has a fight on his hands regarding Sellafield and the MOX plant. The manner in which the Minister of State, the Government and the country are being treated in that regard is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Energy is taken for granted by the present generation. Conserving energy is not a buzzword. When one presses a switch the light should be there. A gas heater should work when switched on and one should complain to Bord Gáis or the ESB if it does not. Many people forget to turn off lights or the television when leaving a room. Although these are small matters individually, they lead to a waste of energy when taken collectively. People are unaware of the need to conserve energy and Members of the Oireachtas are <Col N="427" /> no better or worse than anyone else in that regard. That many Members did not care about turning off the lights in their offices meant that timers were fitted, so that lights would be switched off automatically. We should address all issues, including those directly related to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy made an excellent contribution and I fully agree with him on wind farms. Harnessing wind produces clean energy, but it is not a new process. When I was a small boy growing up on a farm in County Cavan, many people generated energy from wind and they had artificial light long before the ESB's rural electrification programme. Windmills have been updated and modified and those we see today are not unsightly. Deputy Deasy argued that each county should be self-sufficient regarding energy production and County Cavan is leading the way, thanks to the endeavours of a progressive businessman, Seán Quinn, who generates power from wind for his cement plants and glass factory. It is lovely to see ten windmills churning slowly on the horizon of the Ballyconnell Mountains as one comes along the road. A gale force wind is not needed to drive the windmills, as a little breeze will set them in motion. They represent the way forward as they are noiseless and do not discharge emissions.</P>
    <P>An application was made by an outside company to Cavan County Council for planning permission for a wind farm with 38 windmills. The council granted permission and welcomed the development. There has been an objection, however, from An Taisce, a faceless organisation without a mandate which pretends to be concerned about the environment. If An Taisce is genuinely concerned about the environment, it will recognise that windmills have a key role to play, as they are nice to look at and generate clean power without emissions or noise. The public should be made aware of An Taisce's two-faced attitude to conserving the environment, as it has objected to a means of proper and clean energy production. Not only do wind farms generate energy, but they provide an annual income for small farmers on whose land the windmills are constructed. It is generally true that windmills are built on high ground, which may be defined as marginal in farming terms. A farmer receives an up front payment for the nuisance of the construction of a windmill on his land, as well as a good annual income. Farmers are fully in favour of wind energy.</P>
    <P>Another instance of natural energy can be found in Glangevlin, in the west of my county. An American company has proposed to drill for natural gas in the area, as it is sure that there are substantial levels of gas about 2,000 feet under ground. Cavan County Council displayed its progressive nature by giving planning permission for test drilling in Glangevlin, but objections from An Taisce have meant that the project is at a standstill. Although An Taisce claims to be con<Col N="428" /> cerned about the preservation of the environment, it opposes the utilisation of this natural resource. The gas can be cleanly brought up to ground level to allow Bord Gáis to pipe it into the system and make it available to homes and industries for heating and other uses. The Glangevlin area of County Cavan has not had many resources or much development in the past, so the gas find there should be used to benefit Counties Leitrim, Cavan, Longford and Sligo. I want to Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to be aware that the development has been stopped by an unelected body without a mandate, which is unfortunate and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I will make a final point about smokeless fuels, although I appreciate that it is not the responsibility of Deputy Jacob. Why is the Minster for the Environment and Local Government continuing to allow the installation of solid fuel cookers in local authority houses, given that he is talking about bringing in a ban on non-smokeless fuels? It does not make sense to me, so how will he square the circle? Elderly people are worried that they will not be able to use turf and coal to keep warm. An old woman told me that although she will be able to breathe clean and fresh air, she will die of the cold. The people of this country will not stand for that and she will not die of the cold as long as I can help it. We need clear policy making if we are to talk seriously about smokeless fuel and cleaning up the environment. Is there an abundance of smokeless fuel, to ensure that older people will not be left in the miserable cold?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the nine Deputies who made thoughtful and thought-provoking contributions to this Second Stage debate. I appreciate the level of support, in principle, for the Bill and I look forward to committee and further stages. We live in an era in which environmental issues are increasingly topical. The planet is vulnerable as a result of years of practices relating to natural resources which cannot be sustained. The issues involved cannot be ignored and Governments throughout the world have been forced to act. Available scientific evidence, notably the recently published third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, indicates that substantial measures are required if we are to avert the environmental crisis we face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is firmly committed to the principle of sustainable development. In April 2001, I attended a major international conference on the matter in New York, organised by the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. I reaffirmed and outlined Ireland's commitment to sustainable energy policies and indicated how Ireland will progress to meeting its energy requirements in an environmentally and economically sustainable way. The Kyoto Protocol, as mentioned by many Deputies, has set challenging targets for Ireland, but the Government is <Col N="429" /> determined to meet its obligations. Deputies have made clear that we need to be committed to meeting the Kyoto guidelines and to taking all necessary measures. The general approval of Deputies for the principle of the Bill is encouraging.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins asked about the additional advantages of the establishment of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland under this Bill. It will be an independent agency, guided by its own board and capable of presenting its case at Government level. It will be released from the restraints of the human resource practices which obtain in larger organisations. The interim board has already made a significant impact on the structure and staffing of the authority. The board has raised the profile of the body and facilitated a renewed impetus for the work that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins also asked about the programmes envisaged. Programmes are already under way and I compliment the staff and the interim board under its excellent chairman on being active in advance of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A key commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium was realised in June 2001 with the launch of an energy efficiency scheme in public sector design studies. This was followed in August by the second phase &ndash; the model solutions investment support scheme. A third phase of this programme &ndash; support for energy management bureau operations &ndash; is being planned. This programme will cost 12.7 million and will aim to stimulate the application of improved energy efficiency, design strategies, technologies and service in public sector building construction and retrofit projects. The programme will act as an exemplar for good practice and as a demand leader for the service of the technologies involved. Deputy Gilmore and others referred to the responsibility of the public sector to be involved in these issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to research and development. On 26 September 2001, the house of tomorrow programme for 2000 to 2006 was launched. This programme has a proposed budget of 21.1 million and offers support for research, development and demonstration projects aimed at generating and applying technologies, products, systems, practices and information leading to more sustainable energy performance in housing. This is a key issue which was raised by Deputies during this debate. A research and development programme for renewables is also being prepared.</P>
    <P>Over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, £146 million has been earmarked for expenditure on the built environment, research and development, renewables, the expansion and upgrading of the grid and energy conservation and awareness. Some Deputies were uncharitable towards the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, regarding his budgetary provisions, but I remind them that £146 million, a substantial amount of money, has been ear<Col N="430" /> marked by the Minister for this important area in the next six years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised staffing issues to which I referred in my introduction. The Deputy asked whether staff were against the establishment of this stand alone body, but nothing could be further from the truth. Staff will be moving from a large organisation with 800 staff to a body with a complement of about 50. As I stated in my opening speech it is natural that staff would be concerned about career paths, promotional opportunities and so on, issues which need to be, and are being, addressed. The consultative forum has been established to ensure staff have an opportunity to discuss these issues in an open and transparent manner.</P>
    <P>I was uplifted by the positive contributions of Deputies Deasy and Boylan. The Deputies sent a strong message from this House about the advantages of renewables, particularly wind energy, which are most suited to our climate. Deputy Deasy referred to the geographic imbalance in the spread of wind farms. There are about 22 commercial wind farms at present, but we would all aspire to a greater geographic spread of such sites and a significant increase in the amount of electricity generated using this excellent source. The Deputy was correct in stating the action in this regard is on the western seaboard, particularly in the north-west and south-west. However, a number of planning applications have been lodged for on-land projects in the east, and one or two projects have already secured planning permission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also referred to the offshore situation. There is substantial interest in offshore wind generation off the east coast such as in the Kish and Arklow banks. The Deputy asked for a substantial amount of information, some of which I can give him now, but I will arrange for the remainder of it to be supplied to him in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins in particular will know about AER V. The application deadline for this competition closed on 30 November and 58 applications were received. We stipulated that we would accept only applications with planning permission as we wish the projects to move to the building phase as soon as possible, rather than falling at the initial planning phase as was the case with previous competitions. A total of 58 applications have been received involving more than 300 megawatts. This is a healthy and encouraging scenario from my perspective and that of the officials in my Department who have worked so diligently on this offer. I have little doubt the competition will provide the maximum result and will go half way towards meeting our target between now and 2005. We will be moving to the next phase immediately which will deliver the second half of that target by 2005. We are on target in this respect.</P>
    <P>Six or seven developers are active and interested in projects off the east coast involving about 1,500 megawatts. Licences have issued <Col N="431" /> from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to allow this work to continue. I thank Deputies who contributed to this debate and look forward to Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Members of this House know, the forum is a two phase process with the first phase focusing on the implications of enlargement and the organisation of the future of Europe debate. In the second phase, the forum will examine <Col N="432" /> Ireland's overall relationship with the European Union.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the National Forum on Europe is an independent body, with an independent chairperson and secretariat. The agenda and work programme are a matter for the forum and neither I nor my office has any responsibility for these issues. As such, it would be inappropriate for me to report on progress to date within the forum, or to comment on its day to day operation.</P>
    <P>I, nonetheless, take this opportunity to congratulate the forum's chairman, Senator Maurice Hayes for the work that has already been done and for the purposeful and constructive manner in which he and his staff have been managing the business of the forum. Senator Hayes has contributed enormously to advancing the agenda of the forum and has been most effective in gaining the confidence of all the participants.</P>
    <P>The costs which have accrued to date in respect of the National Forum on Europe amount to £152,283 or 193,360. The cost associated with operating each plenary is in the region of £10,000 or 12,697. To date seven plenary sessions have been held with one more planned in 2001.</P>
    <P>The cost of operating the National Forum on Europe in 2002 is estimated at £1.57 million per annum or 2 million or £131,260 or 166,667 per month. The forum will shortly tender for the installation of a new computer system, while the estimated cost of the design and maintenance of its website for 2001 is £12,000 or 15,237. A break down of the costs to date and for 2002 is available in the tables which follow this reply.</P>
    <P>The forum is supported by a secretariat comprising departmental officials seconded from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs, and Defence. In addition, one person has been recruited from an agency on a short-term, unestablished basis in a clerical capacity.</P>
    <P>The Department grades involved are one assistant secretary, one counsellor, one principal officer, one first secretary, one administrative officer, one higher executive officer, one executive officer, and three clerical officers, one of whom is working on a job-sharing basis. The secretariat is headed by an assistant secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, who formerly acted as secretary general of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, and co-ordinator of the secretariat of the New Ireland Forum. The full staffing complement has only recently been put in place. Accordingly, full staffing costs will only apply from this month onwards.</P>
    <P>With regard to my foreign diary commitments for the first half of 2002, I plan to go to the United States during the St. Patrick's day period. However, my programme for that visit is not yet finalised. I will attend the spring European Council in Barcelona on 15 and 16 of March. On 17 and 18 May I will attend the EU Africa, Caribbean, Pacific and Latin America Summit, in Madrid. I will attend the European Council in Seville on 21 and 22 June.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> The work programme for this week's Laeken European Council is quite intensive and at the moment I have no specific plans for formal bilateral meetings. I will, nonetheless, have an opportunity for informal discussions with many of my colleagues, including the Prime Minister Mr. Blair, on the margins of the summit. I met the Belgian Prime Minister and the current President-in-office of the European Union, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, on Thursday 6 December. Prime Minister Verhofstadt was in Dublin as part of his pre-council tour of capitals.</P>
    <P>Central to our discussions was the draft text of the declaration which we expect to agree at Laeken. We discussed the mandate that will be given to the convention which will take the future of Europe debate forward between 2002 and the commencement of the next intergovernmental conference in 2004. The Belgian Presidency is continuing its work on the declaration to take account of the views expressed during the Prime Minister's tour of capitals.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister Mr. Verhofstadt and I also discussed the continuing EU response to the events of 11 September, and in particular, the progress to-date in implementing the milestones agreed at Tampere in 1999. I assured the Prime Minister that Ireland remained committed to the fight against terrorism, and that we were looking forward to a successful outcome in this area and agreement on a European arrest warrant during the Laeken Council.</P>

      <P>The National Forum on Europe was established by the Taoiseach and all costs attached to the forum are borne by the Exchequer. This is the first series of questions put down on the forum and the manner in which they are dealt with will establish a precedent for the future. The Taoiseach is refusing to answer questions on what is happening at the forum. What questions on the forum does the Taoiseach consider appropriate to answer and what is he ruling out? Once a precedent is established on this new item, the rules will be followed for the next three or four years, for as long as the forum lasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my role as Taoiseach I have replied to questions on whether, how and when the Government might facilitate wider public debate on Ireland's membership of the European Union. Prior to the referendum on the Nice Treaty, I indicated to the House that the Government had agreed to the establishment of a national forum and I subsequently answered questions regarding its establishment, given that it is the responsibility of the Government to work out how and when the forum might operate. The forum is now up and running.</P>
      <P>Following substantial discussion with the parties represented in the House and to facilitate debate, it was agreed that the forum would be independent of the Government. It is independent and should be seen to be so. The forum was established on that basis and I cannot reply to questions regarding the work of an independent body. That is neither my function nor my role. I do not influence the forum's agenda, nor do I wish to do so.</P>
      <P>I have occasionally referred to the forum during replies to supplementary questions on matters relating to the outcome of the referendum on the Nice Treaty and other matters on the European agenda for which I am answerable, but these references have been within the terms of reference of the forum and the input it might have in facilitating wider public debate.</P>
      <P>To avoid any perception of interference &ndash; an issue which was raised in the discussions on setting up the forum &ndash; I do not intend to comment on the specific work programme of the forum, who should speak or how its debates should be conducted. I have no authority in that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The forum has been established by the Taoiseach. Every expense attached to the forum is borne by the Exchequer. The Taoiseach appointed the chairman of the forum and, with the exception of Fine Gael, the other parties in the House are participating in it. How does the Taoiseach propose that the forum would be accountable to the House, other than by answering parliamentary questions, or is he confirming my initial suspicion that the European debate was being taken out of the House and put into Dublin Castle, that the Taoiseach would no longer be accountable for it and that he was going to close <Col N="435" /> the debate down until the forum had finished its discussions?</P>

      <P>Last week we had an extensive discussion on the Laeken Council. Today I answered questions about my meeting with the President-in-office, Guy Verhofstadt.</P>
      <P>A wide ranging debate on Europe must take account of the views of the Irish people. While a debate in the Dáil or Seanad would allow elected representatives to speak on the issue, the national forum, through the special observer pillar and other arrangements, is now allowing a wider debate to take place. Whether Deputy Noonan likes it or not, the forum is independent. The parties which form part of the forum represent some of the parties in this House and other organisations through the special observer pillar. The committee fixes the agenda and I have no part in that. I neither design nor control it, and so I am not answerable for it either.</P>

      <P>That would be fine if the Taoiseach answered questions on how the Government will deal with the fact that the Irish people did not ratify the Nice Treaty. However, when we ask the Taoiseach questions about the Nice Treaty he says it is being discussed at the forum.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will not answer questions about the forum which means he will not answer them about the Treaty of Nice. We are facing into a general election, we do not know his view on enlargement of the European Union, if he plans another referendum on the Treaty of Nice to allow the people to ratify it and enable enlargement or what the terms of any referendum would be. When we ask questions about the Treaty of Nice the Taoiseach will not answer them because he says the issue is being discussed in the forum. Where is the accountability? Will there be an interim report produced by the chairman of the forum in the next three months?</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach answer some questions in relation to the mandate of the convention that will be confirmed in Laeken this week? On the basis of his most recent meeting with the Belgian Prime Minister, could he outline what the broad framework of the mandate of the convention will be? Could he also indicate how long the convention will last? Will it last into 2003? What will be the standing of the convention if the Treaty of Nice is not ratified by all the member states at the end of 2002? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming clearer what will happen. The intention is that the convention will commence operations in March. It is intended that it will be finished within 12 months, so it will be finished for Easter 2003 but not later than a time that will allow it to report in final form to the European Council in June 2003. There will then be a firebreak period to allow people to reflect on what the convention sets out. The Intergovernmental Conference will start in the summer&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To allow people to reflect on the outcome of the convention rather than going straight into the Intergovernmental Conference. It might change at the weekend but that is where it lies at this stage and it is unlikely to change. The Intergovernmental Conference will start effectively with the Irish Presidency, in&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Spring 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, spring 2004. The only other major change from what I reported to the House last week and the week before in Question Time, is that the original idea of the convention, or presidium, would report in final form on most issues and not allow options. I think that is chang<Col N="437" /> ing as Prime Minister Verhofstadt moves around and what he is more likely to do &ndash; he seems disposed to it &ndash; is in the areas where there is agreement and no alternative views, they will state this is the position. The final agreed position is that in areas where there are conflicting views, they will set down the options but indicate where the balance of agreement lies. If there are three options, they will say that this is the indication. The value of this is that it will avoid opening up debate on agreed aspects at the end of the report but during the firebreak period it will allow the focus to be on addressing the options and allowing their consideration.</P>
      <P>It will start with four issues &ndash; the delimitation of powers between the EU and member states, the status in the charter of fundamental rights, the implication of the treaties and the role of national parliaments in the European architecture. It is highly unlikely that it will hold to those for very long &ndash; I have no doubt there will be extensions to it &ndash; but that, at least, will be the opening remit of the chair. The chair is not yet appointed and no name has been put forward but it will be discussed at the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the firebreak period of approximately nine months will allow the member states to prepare for an Intergovernmental Conference starting in the spring of 2004 with the intention of concluding by the end of 2004. Is that timetable correct? In relation to issues other than the four the Taoiseach has read out, is it the Irish Government's intention to ensure that the issue of the number of commissioners in the Commission and the size of the Commission is revisited given the decision taken at Nice that there would be a limitation on the number of commissioners if the composition of the EU went above 27 states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage there is no final date on the completion of it. As the Deputy knows, it is usually about six months, so somewhere between spring and autumn 2004. On the Deputy's second question, following the EU's analysis and the research they undertook on the referendum, I have been looking very carefully and consulting informally with colleagues about what would be possible if we were to go back and seek support. There are a number of issues that come out of that review which Deputy Quinn as well as everyone else has seen. It is unlikely we would get anywhere if we went back with a shopping list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must identify the key issues so we can go back. What we know is what was said in Gothenburg which was that our European colleagues would be helpful and, while they would not change the Treaty of Nice, they would see what they could do to help us. This is something that must be addressed at the summer Council in Seville but it would have to be well negotiated beforehand. If we went raw to the European Council and said this is where we are at, we would <Col N="438" /> get a definite no but if we consult with them we could see what we have. We have not signed off on that list nor have we extensively consulted with colleagues. I have canvassed the views of colleagues for their help and assistance when we come to that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that the Government is open to the possibility that the convention will take on a life of its own and control of its own agenda? Is the Government, represented by the Taoiseach and the present Administration, prepared to add to the four items already mentioned the revisiting of the issue on the composition of the Commission on the basis that it was a compromise which was found to be unsatisfactory not only in this country but in other countries as well? Is the Taoiseach saying that, in his bilateral meetings with heads of government of the other member states, he has raised the possibility that the decision taken at Nice would, in effect, be superseded by a new decision on the composition of the Commission arising from would be the Treaty at the end of 2004?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have discussed the issues that created difficulty for us &ndash; and they are two of the issues &ndash; the formal position of the European Council is that the Nice Treaty cannot be amended. Deputy Quinn asked a different question in asking what issues are to be added to the agenda. That allows us and other countries to raise new issues&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past week, at least two prime ministers re-visited the issue of qualified majority voting which was very clearly signed off at Nice this day last year. People thought that would be the end of that for a long time. However, I did not believe that would be the case. It is open for us to come back with other issues. People would say we will not get anywhere in regard to the treaty. However, next summer there is an opportunity for us to raise an issue, but not to change the treaty. Let us be clear that we will not be able to do that. If we want clarification or support on some items it is an opportunity for us to bring those items to the table. That is an opportunity we should take if we believe we would get sufficient support. It would not be possible to change the treaty but there may be other ways through which to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>If questions to the Taoiseach on the national forum are in order, it should be possible to ask this question. Is the Taoiseach aware of the focus of the forum in dealing with enlargement and that the outcome of the discussions has <Col N="439" /> largely resulted in a consensus on it and its benefits, but that the areas of sovereignty have not been dealt with and this needs to be done?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this is a natural conclusion to come to at this point in the forum's life, by way of a report?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the convention to be agreed upon at Laeken is to produce a document for a new treaty for the European Union and as such would he pursue the possibility of two documents arising out of that process? The integrationists and the Euro-federalists will obviously have a view as to how that document should develop as will those who believe in an intergovernmental approach, based on nation states maintaining national democracy. I gather from previous discussions that the Taoiseach may be among the latter group.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that view should also be reflected in another document and would he be in favour of a consultative referendum on that process to ensure that the democratic deficit is minimised in the European Union when we are dealing with these important issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter, as I said to Deputy Noonan, I will not get into the day to day issues. From what I heard in this House and in the campaign last year, people seem to be in favour of enlargement &ndash; and there is a Fine Gael motion on this issue tonight. It is one thing to be in favour of enlargement but then if the view is taken that the Nice Treaty deals with something more than enlargement and we cannot deal with the Nice issue then we are effectively holding up enlargement.</P>
      <P>The position is now very clear. As I stated last summer, it looks as if this time next year the ten applicant countries will be ready. Commissioner Verheugen makes it very clear in his recent report that we will face ten countries joining together and clearly that cannot be done under the Amsterdam treaty. It requires agreement to the Nice Treaty, and as it stands at the moment we are holding that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other outstanding issues, and as I said in my reply earlier, in the first case the forum was to deal with other issues. It is now set down that it will deal with preliminary issues in the first instance and then the Laeken issue &ndash; the future of Europe debate &ndash; in the longer term. At this stage the draft documents for Laeken contain an enormous number of questions about what will happen in future, how will the treaties be divided, what is subsidiarity, what is the best way for countries to deal with various issues, and should it always be by means of EU directives or by subsidiarity. They are all listed and will have to be answered in the course of that debate but that is only the start of the process. Every country will have to answer them and one of the issues which emerged in last year's referendum was that in many cases, the view of the public is that if subsidiarity works and if the domain of a national <Col N="440" /> government works then it should be at that level and we should not get involved in directives, co-decisions or other issues. All of those issues have been listed in question form for the convention to deal with and I have no doubt the list will be added to next weekend, and also between then and next spring when the forum starts.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the main, if not the sole interest, of European colleagues in Ireland's view at the summit next weekend, will concentrate on our post-Nice referendum position? Is it not a fact that our European colleagues will want to know if we are in favour of enlargement and if we are in a position to impede or delay it, in view of the ten applicant countries who will be ready to complete accession negotiations next year?</P>
      <P>At Laeken what will the Taoiseach say he has done over the past six months following the defeat of the Nice Treaty referendum?

      <P>I would be glad to if Deputy O'Keeffe's party leader had not interrupted me before I even opened my mouth. In Gothenburg I said we would reflect on the sovereign democratic <Col N="441" /> vote of the people and then examine the reasons behind the decision and act accordingly on them.</P>
      <P>A number of reasons were highlighted such as confusion, information deficit and concerns about Europe and on other fronts. Each of those is being dealt with. We are explaining why enlargement is important and looking at the issues that make the European model important to this country such as those relating to agriculture, trade and investment. All of these issues are now being debated and the case put. Within the Department of Foreign Affairs, my colleague will outline tonight the work that is ongoing. My colleague will tonight outline the work that is ongoing.</P>
      <P>There is a need to consider the outstanding issues and how they should be addressed.

      <P>The question put to the Taoiseach by Deputy Sargent gets to the nub of the difficulties many of those opposed to the Nice Treaty continue to have with it. It is artificial for the Taoiseach to take questions in this House and not reply to a reasonable question which gets to the heart of the matter. He has also created enormous difficulties for himself in his reply to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. He proposes to keep his colleagues in Europe informed on progress made in Ireland at the summit in Laeken. The basis of his information to them will be the discussions at the forum. This means he will freely inform his colleagues in Europe of the debates at the forum but he will refuse similar information to this House.</P>
      <P>In an earlier reply the Taoiseach said he does not know if the chairman of the forum will issue an interim report next month. I am informed informally it is his intention to do so and Deputy Quinn has also informed the House to this effect. Is it the case that the Taoiseach has misinformed the House or has he not kept himself briefed on such an essential issue? Will he outline the position and if a report is to be issued next month will he correct the record of the House?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach wrote to party leaders to nominate members to the committee of the regions on an all-party basis and that was done. The nominees are due to be renewed at the end of the month but I have received no correspondence. What is the Taoiseach's intention in this matter?</P>

      <P>It is not an issue now and we will have to see what happens. I was clear in my answer to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. The deliberations at the forum are part of the overall process in which the country must engage following the result of the Nice referendum. The debates are an important part of trying to deal with the fact that 54% of those who voted opposed the treaty. All other issues and analyses are ongoing.</P>

It was agreed that a report would be issued after the conclusion of deliberations on the first issue but the chairman has not said he will produce a report next month. There will not be clarity on this aspect until the meetings around the country take place. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is dealing with the committee of the regions.</P>

I originally supported the candidature of Wim Koch for president of the convention but he has since declared he is no longer available. As soon as we finish our work <Col N="443" /> this weekend we will consider the composition of the Irish participants. We will require a strong team, both at official and parliamentary level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is a fire break of nine months necessary for Governments to reflect on the outcome of the convention, given that they will participate throughout its year of work and will be fully up to date on its deliberations? Why do they need a further nine months to think about what they have already thought about? Is the fire break not designed by those countries opposed to the idea of a convention with a view to ensuring that whatever the convention produces is forgotten before the Intergovernmental Conference starts? Is it the case that the fire break idea is being promoted by larger countries who do not want the convention to get a hearing?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that, in contrast to the interpretation placed on his words by Deputy Sargent, the intergovernmental approach, which Deputy Sargent prefers, does not suit the interests of smaller countries and that what is required is strong institutions at European level, such as the European Commission, acting with a strong mandate that operates to the benefit of smaller countries and that intergovernmentalism suits the British, Germans and French and nobody else? Has the Taoiseach decided that there will be a second referendum on the Nice Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure where the idea of the fire break originated but the arguments in favour were not posited because of Deputy Bruton's fears but because it was agreed that the Intergovernmental Conference would take place in 2004 and that it would be inappropriate to commence an Intergovernmental Conference immediately after Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice. The view was that a break should be provided after the convention period to allow wider participation than merely those involved in the presidium. It is envisaged that Parliaments, the public, the social partners and others with an interest should be able to participate. On balance I believe this approach to be a good idea because if there is direct movement from what will be a report to an Intergovernmental Conference, there is a danger the public may be unaware of what is happening or may not take sufficient interest in developments. That is what happened last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued about the strength of the Commission many times in this House and it will arise again from these discussions in Laeken. The strength of the Commission, how it will operate in future and its role in relation to small member states are important issues for discussion. The protection of the Commission by the smaller countries is a major concern in this EU Presidency. It is an open secret that the larger countries are setting out to &ndash; perhaps &ldquo;undermine&rdquo;<Col N="444" /> is too strong or unreasonable &ndash; but, certainly, to take back power from the Commission. I believe they will try to narrow the range of power of the Commission and that, in the next decade, that will be the line of attack of the Germans and the French.

        <b>: </b>Arising from his discussions with the Belgian Prime Minister, is the Taoiseach aware that, on the occasion of the EU summit, there will be very large groups of EU citizens from European trade unions, the anti-capitalist movement and others who will seek to protest peacefully about some key policies of the EU, particularly the massive drive towards privatisation of public services? Did the Taoiseach discuss this with the Prime Minister of Belgium and did he raise my concern that the Belgian police would not act provocatively, as happened in Gothenburg in January, and thereby foment violence among sections of the demonstration, which we all wish to be peaceful? People have the right to protest for alternative policies. Will the Taoiseach confirm, for the benefit of Deputy Noonan, that Fine Gael can still join the debate on the National Forum for Europe, if it gives up its policy of abstentionism? We used to associate that with the republican movement rather than a long-standing bastion of the establishment known as Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>On the Deputy's third question, the answer is yes. I did not discuss the secur<Col N="445" /> ity aspect but I am aware of the arrangements for the weekend and I hope the situation will be peaceful. In relation to Gothenburg, there is no doubt the situation got out of control. The Swedish Government took a very liberal view and issued licences to all those who sought permission to march. On the first night of the summit, 18 different groups marched and protested. They were allowed to proceed with almost no security &ndash; that would not happen anywhere else in the world &ndash; right through the main street, right beside the buildings in which the meetings were taking place and that went off very peacefully. However, at 10 a.m. on the following morning, a crowd of yahoos, gangsters and thugs began to wreck the place, breaking hotel and shop windows, including the hotel where I was. At 10 a.m. that behaviour could not be attributed to drugs, drink or anti-social behaviour.</P>

      <Quest>the number of licensed operators who took part in his Department's free travel scheme since 1997; his plans to improve the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel scheme was introduced in 1967. The scheme is intended to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community. The scheme also facilitates mobility for those without access to cars and the greater use of public transport infrastructure during off-peak times. From its inception, the scheme applied to the services operated by the CIE Group. The services covered have been extended progressively since 1967 and, at this point, there are some 80 private bus, ferry and air operators participating in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in the scheme is open to all transport operators licensed to operate a public scheduled service, who are properly insured and hold a current tax clearance certificate. Operators who meet these criteria and who wish to participate in <Col N="446" /> the scheme can expect to have their applications accepted. This policy is designed to maximise access to the scheme among the categories who are eligible to travel free. The policy is successful with, for example, an overall increase of 32 in the number of private operators participating in the scheme since the beginning of January 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition to the improvements in the range of services covered by the scheme, the categories who qualify for the scheme have been extended over the years and improvements have also been made to facilitate the use of the scheme. For example, since coming into office I have provided for the retention of the free travel pass by recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind persons pension when they transfer to another long-term social welfare payment. I have also extended the free travel companion pass to all persons aged 75 and over who are medically unfit to travel alone. In the recent budget, the companion pass scheme was extended to invalidity pensioners who are unable to travel unaccompanied. This standardises the qualifying conditions for a companion pass for recipients of invalidity pension and disability allowance. Further improvements will be considered in the light of emerging needs and the overall budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just confirmed that 32 new private bus operators have been included in the free travel scheme since he took office in his Department. Is he aware that a total of 538 licences have been issued by the Department of Public Enterprise since 1997? Will he admit that the relatively low take-up of this scheme by private bus operators indicates that we need to legislate for this and to ensure everyone who receives a licence to operate a bus route should make it available to our senior citizens who avail of this scheme? Does the Minister agree that should be provided for in legislation? </P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>I confirm that 42 applications have been received in that period. Three were refused because they did not have a proper licence, two did not follow up the initial application and five are currently being processed. The issue to which the Deputy referred is a matter which might be looked at, particularly by the Minister for Public Enterprise, but it would, obviously, have substantial implications in relation to the budget for the free travel scheme. The national development plan 2000 to 2006 makes a substantial provision of £3.5 million for the development of pilot public transport initiatives &ndash; the rural transport initiative. That scheme was piloted after some study on those areas that are not covered. Even the number of additional licences to which the Deputy referred would not cover some of the very outlying areas of the country. Having consulted with the people involved in this area, particularly local communities, the general view that emerged is that we should allow community-led schemes to provide transport. As <Col N="447" /> already stated, £3.5 million has been provided in the national development plan for this type of initiative. A number of pilot projects are already up and running.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that while the free travel scheme is excellent for pensioners who live in urban areas, it is less successful in catering for those who live in rural areas? Given that the Government is involved in the closure of many post offices in rural areas, would he consider extending the scheme to allow pensioners use taxis? Does the Minister accept there is a need for legislation to be drawn up by his Department and the Department of Public Enterprise given that there were more than 500 applications from private bus operators &ndash; only 32 have been taken up since he entered office &ndash; in respect of the extension of the free travel scheme? This is the most effective scheme to help the elderly but it does not operate in the way it should in rural areas.</P>

A further ten are in the pre-development stage and will be funded to become operational. I emphasise that the general view is that it would be difficult to control the scheme if it were extended to taxis.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the various activities of my Department reach in one way or another into virtually every household in the country and the impending changeover to the euro will impact on all of these households. As part of my ministerial responsibilities, I am charged with ensuring my Department's smooth transition to the new currency. I must be satisfied that all my Department's customers are aware of the implications of the euro changeover on their social welfare payments. In particular, our customers need to be assured they will not lose out financially when the changeover occurs on 1 January. To that end, my Department has availed of the print and broadcast media to ensure this <Col N="449" /> important message gets across to its diverse range of customers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>My personal involvement in the current euro media campaign emphasises the importance of the message being conveyed and the importance the Government attaches to a smooth and effective changeover. My Department will also establish a freephone euro helpline to handle customer queries about any social welfare aspect of the euro changeover. The freephone will commence from 12 December 2001 and will remain available into the dual circulation period which ends on 9 February 2002.</P>

The order to effect this transfer was made on 27 July 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fundraising in line with the recognition in the White Paper of the need for a more modern legal framework. The work of reviewing the legislation which is under way in my Department will be accompanied by a broad public consultation on the appropriate regulatory framework and the nature and extent of the legislative reform <Col N="451" /> required. My Department has recently held discussions with the Law Reform Commission on this question. The commission indicated that it will shortly commence an examination of charity law with a view to producing a report on the necessary legal reforms. My Department is working in close co-operation with the commission in the preparation of the consultation document and in the reform of the charities legislation. In this regard, my Department has recently sought and received proposals for consultants to review certain specific subjects in preparation for the public consultation. These proposals are currently under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have previously pointed out, a wide range of views exist on the complicated questions which arise in reviewing the current legislation. The fundamental nature of the review which I am carrying out requires as broad a consultation as possible with sufficient time allowed for consideration of such important issues. In this regard, it is envisaged that proposals for legislative reform will be brought forward following completion of the consultation process which will begin early in the new year.</P>

Does he agree that there is a need to regulate charities given that NGOs raise close to £30 million per year and that Ireland is the only country in the EU which has no registration of charities and where there is no commitment to ensure that the accounts of charities are published and in the public domain?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the recent remark by his colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, that the legislation is &ldquo;going nowhere&rdquo;? Would he agree with that? What discussions has he had with the Minister of State, given her view that he is simply unable to bring forward the legislation and given the view of the House? He brought forward a Pensions Bill which he has gutted as a result of the performance in the Seanad and which will not be reintroduced here until February or March of next year.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme operated this year from 1 June to 30 September and approved students were allowed undertake 200 hours work at £3, 3.81, per hour, giving a possible total tax free payment of £600, 761.84. In order to focus resources where the need is greatest, students who came from a household which is dependent on social welfare payments were entitled to an extra £1, 1.27 per hour worked, providing for a maximum payment of £800, 1,015.79, in their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is operated through sponsors who are approved by my Department to carry out work under the scheme and it is up to each sponsor to recruit qualified students under the scheme. Payments in respect of work done are normally made directly to the sponsors who then reimburse the students involved. Payment arrangements for students are a matter to be decided between the sponsor and the student. Sponsors are advised that they have an obligation to pay the students on a weekly basis. However, with the consent of the student, alternative arrangements can be made. Some students may indicate a preference for payment in a lump sum at the end of the scheme. Students are always <Col N="454" /> advised to discuss the working arrangements and payment arrangements with the sponsor before commencement of any work.</P>
    <P>Many sponsors pay the students from their own funds and then claim reimbursement when the scheme is finished. For accounting and audit purposes each reimbursement form must be signed by two officials from the sponsor organisation and must be accompanied by a signed declaration from the student verifying the hours worked. This information is also necessary in order to pay the extra payment due to some of the students.</P>
    <P>Sponsors were requested this year to submit claims for reimbursement before 12 October 2001. However, some sponsors did not comply with this deadline and this has contributed to the delay. In addition many of the reimbursement applications were found to be incomplete this year and were returned for clarification, thus causing further delay. A particular problem arose this year due to the need to upgrade the payments system in preparation for the introduction of the euro. Payments could not be issued during the course of the upgrade, which was done in November, when many student summer job scheme payments are paid. A backlog arose as a result, and this is now being cleared. I regret the delays which occurred. My Department is working hard to ensure that all outstanding payments are issued as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>As I explained earlier, owing to circumstances beyond our control, there have been some delays. However, a large proportion of students have already been paid and were paid early. It was because of the extra payment, which was a new feature this year as a result of changes we made whereby approximately 1,163 students got an extra payment of £1 per hour, that there were certain difficulties. The same practice was followed as in previous years. These complications arose in November. It would be quite normal that payments would be made even as late as November.

      <P>The introduction of the pre-1953 pension as it is called, has been one of the best developments in pension provisions in recent years and I am proud to have been able to introduce it. It has enabled people who paid social insurance contributions before 1953 and who would otherwise not have obtained benefit from them in pension terms, to qualify for an old age contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the scheme is illustrated by the numbers applying and the numbers qualifying. The initial expectation was that around 3,000 people would qualify for payment. Since its introduction, however, my Department has received 23,000 applications for this pension. Of the 13,000 claims that have been decided so far, 8,300 or 65% have been awarded a pre-1953 pension and are in receipt of payment. Apart from new applicants the initiative has also benefited a further 8,500 people who had already been in receipt of <Col N="456" /> a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory or retirement pension at a lower weekly personal rate but who, with the benefit of their pre-1953 contributions, were able to qualify for a higher rate.</P>
    <P>In total, therefore, 16,800 people have benefited from the pre-1953 pension to date and are currently in receipt of payment. This number will grow as the remaining applications are processed. There are currently 10,000 cases in various stages of processing. The people concerned have been advised of the unavoidable delay in processing their applications. When I introduced the scheme I was aware that the processing of claims would be slow, given the lapse of time since the employment which gave rise to the contributions and the difficulties of tracing old insurance numbers and contribution records.</P>
    <P>The majority of the records which require examination to determine entitlement date back to more than 50 years ago and pre-date computerisation. I could have reduced the delay by deferring the operative date for the provision but I decided against this on the basis that those affected should benefit from the provision as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Additional resources have been deployed to process pre-53 pension claims as quickly as possible. The staff assigned to this project are taking great care to ensure that applications are not being refused wrongly because of any shortcomings in regard to the old records held. The position is being kept under constant review and steps to further improve the situation will be taken as circumstances and demands on other fronts permit. Due to the way the pre-1953 pension project was set up, it is not possible to say what the average processing time is for claims under the scheme. However, the target is to clear all claims by the first quarter of 2002. This will depend on the number of new applications received in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that delays in processing applications will not result in any losses to pensioners and those who qualify for payment will have their claims back dated fully in accordance with the normal provisions.</P>

      <P>This promise was made two years ago in the 1999 budget but, as the Minister has indicated, thousands of people who are entitled to this award have yet to get it. It is hard to believe they could be waiting for two years. Can the Minister explain this time lapse? Most of the people concerned are in their 70s, 80s and 90s. They were hard working people who paid stamps in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Thousands of them have died since the Minister announced the scheme. Why was the money not paid shortly after the announcement was made?</P>

      <P>The Deputy should know that one cannot pay money simply because the announcement was made. This was a much welcomed initiative. In fact, the promise we made before the election was that we would marginally <Col N="457" /> change the contribution conditions to allow people to qualify for contributory pensions. It was envisaged at the time that it would be a short and small change but this was a dramatic change. We went into it with our eyes open and we knew that, given that there was no computerisation, the staff would have to go through old files.</P>
      <P>It is incorrect to claim that people are waiting two years for this. While there are some delays, those who were dealt with first have already been determined. It is done on a first come, first served basis so there would not be anybody waiting two years. A sizeable number of claims have been determined to date and we are doing our best to have the backlog cleared before the first quarter of 2002.</P>
      <P>This is an excellent scheme and it has been widely welcomed. However, it was always going to be difficult to decide on the entitlement because records are extremely old.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The data available for analysis of the differences in share of income between <Col N="458" /> deciles is provided by the ESRI through its analysis of the living in Ireland survey and by the Central Statistics Office through the household budget survey. The results of each of these surveys are not directly comparable due to differences in the methodology used but, at present, the recently released results of the household budget survey, which was carried out between June 1999 and July 2000, provide us with the most up to date data on income shares between deciles. The latest data from the ESRI refers to the 1998 living in Ireland survey.</P>
      <P>The findings of the household budget survey revealed that the ratio between average weekly disposable income of households in the highest income decile compared with those in the lowest decile was 13 to one in 1999-2000, compared with 11 to one in 1994-95. However, when one looks beyond the headline figures, one can see that in real terms households at all income levels are now substantially better off than they were in 1994-95. It should be noted that the results of the household budget survey do not reflect the fact that calculation of income does not take account of household size and composition. Households in the top income deciles are larger and are much more likely to contain two or more employees. For example, 80% of the top income decile households had two or more employees compared with only 0.4% of the lowest income decile.</P>
      <P>This is further reflected in the results of the 1998 living in Ireland survey which showed significant reductions in the levels of consistent poverty in Ireland since 1994. Consistent poverty fell from 15% in 1994 to 8% in 1998, and we are, therefore, well on our way to achieving our revised national anti-poverty strategy target of reducing this number below 5% by 2004. I expect further progress on this front once detailed figures for 2000 are published.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>The success of policies over recent years in combating unemployment and reducing the level of consistent poverty demonstrates a tangible improvement in the lot of people on lower incomes, notwithstanding the very rapid increase in average incomes driven by economic success and, particularly, the significant increase in employment.</P>
      <P>Our commitment is to strive towards the creation of an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate in the social and economic life of this country. We have given practical effect to that commitment in our economic, labour market and budgetary policies over the term of this Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the fundamental legacies of this Government, as Mr. Noel Clear of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul said last week, is the rampant growth in inequality that has taken place over the past five years? The Minister has admitted today that this society is more unequal now than when the rain<Col N="459" /> bow Government left office. The highest decile is doing much better. Does the Minister agree that, as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Combat Poverty Agency have reported, the richest 10% of our population owns a quarter of the national income, the poorest 10% owns only 3%, our rate of child poverty is the highest in the European Union and that our women and older people have a high rate of poverty? In summary, the Minister is handing on a legacy of serious inequality and a society more divided than ever. While people will acknowledge that national income has increased, the Minister has failed in his major remit.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties which ex-prisoners can face when attempting to get a foothold in the workforce. I also recognise the importance of employment in helping ex-prisoners to re-integrate into the community. My Department administers a wide range of employment support services which are designed to assist and encourage the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups, including ex-offenders, to return to work, training or further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to work allowance scheme provides incentives and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities, to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment. The scheme has been highly successful since its introduction. In order to assist ex-prisoners to take their place in society, periods spent in prison can be used for the purposes of access to this scheme. My Department's employment support service also administers the back to education allowance programme. Periods spent in prison <Col N="461" /> may also be used to facilitate access to this scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the continued relevance of the back to education scheme, my Department is in the process of commissioning an independent comprehensive evaluation of the scheme. This will cover all aspects of the current scheme, including the qualifying requirements, and will form the basis for any future changes to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Recent studies have indicated that ex-prisoners may not be fully aware of the employment support options which are available. My Department is in contact with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to providing user friendly information and contact details to ex-prisoners to enable them to access the employment opportunities which are available. My Department's existing employment support programmes, coupled with a wide range of supports and interventions currently available through other State agencies, can provide a good quality of support to ex-offenders.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the comment of the much admired governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, that 88% of offenders were unemployed at the time they went to prison, is a fundamental aspect of their characteristics? Some 96% of those offenders come from the two lowest socio-economic groups and 75% of prisoners and offenders in Dublin come from six small postal districts. One half of those had left school by age 15 and one-quarter had spent time in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>As a director of the northside partnership in Dublin, I am aware of the progress made due to the &ldquo;Linkage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; programmes. However, given the background of offenders, if we want to integrate ex-offenders back into the workforce, it is necessary to take a much more proactive step. I did not notice resources being put forward for this purpose in the budget.</P>

That is not say that offenders do not get training, they do, and particularly in the prison mentioned by Deputy Broughan. All of these schemes are now available to ex-prisoners. The period of time when they are in prison is taken into account and they do not lose out because they are in prison. They can qualify for the excellent back to work allowance scheme and the back to education scheme which allows them to go into education, even if they do not have training, while retaining social welfare payments if they have to rely on social welfare when they come out of prison. A lot has changed in recent years to facilitate prisoners, unlike decades ago when they were left on the pile and the supports of the State were not available to them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 34, 41, 46, 50 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998, examined a wide range of issues including the payment of carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. The review concluded that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It noted that the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual to ensure that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the review concluded that two income support payments should not be made at the same time. The cost of paying carer's allowance concurrently with another social welfare payment can only be estimated on the basis of the number of claims awarded or refused where the applicant was receiving another social welfare payment. It is estimated that it would cost in the region of £36.4 million annually to pay carer's allowance with another social welfare payment to this group. There are a number of carers who did not claim a carer's allowance because they were already receiving another more beneficial payment. It is not possible to identify this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the national carers database, I have no plans to set up such a system at present. However, some work has been done by the Central Statistics Office to identify the numbers of carers providing full-time care and attention. This was done through the census pilot survey carried out by the CSO in September 1999. It is based on a sample of 8,000 households in which persons aged 15 years or over were asked if they provided unpaid personal help for someone with a long-<Col N="464" /> term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age. The survey found that there are approximately 50,000 full-time carers with about 80,000 providing care on a part-time basis. These results are consistent with the conclusions of the review of the carer's allowance and explain the estimate of 120,000 carers used by the carer organisations. I have asked the Central Statistics Office to consider doing a more detailed analysis of hours spent caring when conducting the census next year.</P>
    <P>As regards those carers who may not be in receipt of a carer's allowance to qualify for the carer's allowance, a person must be providing full-time care and attention to a person who is certified to be in need of such care. The carer's allowance is also subject to a means test. To date this year, approximately 51% of claims refused were disallowed for reasons relating to the need for or provision of care. Where applications are refused on these grounds, full-time care is either not required or is not being provided by the carer. About 8% of claims refused have been on the grounds of means and 41% of refusals have been for other miscellaneous reasons. This group includes carers who are in receipt of another more beneficial social welfare payment, 3%, carers who withdraw their application, 8%, and carers who fail to reply to requests for further information regarding their claim, 18%.</P>
    <P>The Deputies should note that the recently published health strategy commits to developing a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people. The Departments of Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise and my own Department will be involved in this project. It also proposes a number of measures to support carers such as the appointment of key workers in the context of care planning and the introduction of a respite care grant to cover two weeks respite care per annum for dependent older persons.</P>
    <P>I also announced a number of improvements in the recent budget. Carer's allowance rates will increase by £8.06 for carers aged under 66 and £10.03 for carers aged over 66. Carer's benefit rates will also increase by £8.01 per week to £104.51. From April 2002, the weekly income disregards in the carer's allowance means test will increase by £25.42 to £150.42 for a single person and by £50.85 to £300.84 for a couple. This increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £17,813, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance or they can earn up to £28,639 and still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that an additional 3,400 new carers will qualify for payment as a result of the budget changes and an extra 2,300 existing carers will receive an increased payment as a result of this measure in addition to the 19,100 carers currently in receipt of carer's allowance. In addition, for the third successive year, I have made provision for the increase in the respite care grant by <Col N="465" /> £100.02 to £500.10 and £1,000.21 for carers caring for more than one person.</P>
    <P>In relation to the study to examine issues relating to long-term care, which is being carried out by Mercer Limited, I expect that this study will be published within the next few weeks. As the Deputies are aware, the study is being undertaken in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance and any policy proposals arising from the report will be developed in conjunction with these Departments as part of the Government's cross-cutting approach to care issues.</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted to the House that about 22,000 people currently receive the carer's allowance. Of that 22,000, how many receive the maximum rate? Would the Minister care to make a distinction between fostering and caring? If one fosters a child, one gets £200 per week but if one cares for a loved one or a friend, the amount one gets will go up to £96.50 per week under the Minister's proposal. What is the difference? A carer is doing a job for which the State is paying but if they were not doing it, the State would have to pay huge sums of money. Does the Minister accept that carers save Ireland plc about £1.8 billion per year because they are looking after their family, relations, loved ones and friends? Why does the Minister make this innate distinction between caring for a child, as in the case of fostering, and caring for an elderly person? Why is there such a distinction in terms of income?</P>

      <P>I do not have the figures on the number in receipt of the maximum rate or the differential. If the Deputy tabled a question, we would give him the particular information. Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs payments relate to income adequacy &ndash; it provides a basic payment. Since its inception by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, the carer's allowance has not been designed to pay people for caring. It is an income support for people on low income. Progressively over the years, and particularly during the lifetime of this Government, we have raised the disregard to £300 for a couple. As I said earlier, this means that a couple with two children and with an income of over £28,000 can qualify for a carer's allowance. I have already said that creates some disparities. The more one raises the disregard, disparities are created in relation to households which are totally dependent on a social welfare. This Government also initiated the carer's benefit, a scheme designed&mdash;</P>

      <P>To qualify for carers allowance, one had to be living under the same roof as the person being cared for. I relaxed that on two occasions since that issue arose, to such an extent that people no longer have to be living under the same roof. They can live within close proximity. <Col N="468" /> That was a significant change because there were cases, which were somewhat unfair, in which people were living in two houses on the one site. For example, a mother could have been living in one house and her daughter could have been living in a new house next door. They could not have qualified.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I relaxed the provisions with regard to full time care and attention. The requirement that the carer had to be present 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in order to qualify for the payment has been relaxed to allow him or her have a small job or train for ten hours. Again, that was a very significant relaxation. Our officials and the medical referees have to be sure that the recipient of the care is getting full time care and attention if a payment is to be made.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I wish to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matters of public interest requiring urgent attention: the circumstances of the discovery of eight bodies and five others in a serious condition in a container in County Wexford at the weekend; the need for the Minister to report to the House on the progress of the Garda investigation into the tragedy and to outline what contact has been made between the authorities here and in other countries with a view to bringing to justice those involved in the smuggling of these people; the need for the Minister to consider, using the powers available to him, allowing the survivors to remain in this country on humanitarian grounds if they so wish. In view of its importance, I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree to this request.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the middle of June Mr. Justice Flood, the sole member of the Flood tribunal, asked the Government to appoint two new members to the tribunal and an additional member to assist him in his work. The judge asked that this would be done before the summer recess and wrote to the Ceann Comhairle accordingly. The Taoiseach subsequently stated in the House that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government would bring proposals to Cabinet to deal with this matter. However, six months later we are facing another recess and the judges have not been appointed.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that failing to comply with Mr. Justice Flood's request is a kind of interference by stealth with the tribunal as alleged in a leading Sunday newspaper? Is the Government reluctant to have the tribunal deal with Mr. Tom Gilmartin's evidence in the immediate future? What plans does the Taoiseach have to ensure the judge is assisted? The tribunal was appointed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, but Mr. Justice Flood stated that he cannot proceed with his work unless he gets two additional judges. What is the up to date position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that this is the fourth occasion on which this matter has been raised in the House by Deputy Noonan or me. On the last occasion on which I raised it, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, undertook to make inquiries. The Attorney General subsequently held a telephone conversation about five weeks ago with Deputy Howlin during which he indicated that, of the 1,200 people in the library and the array of senior, qualified solicitors who would possibly be available, he was of the view that the Government was finding it difficult to locate a suitable person who would be sufficiently qualified and of sufficient good repute to be able to earn a High Court judge's salary to take on this post. Can the Taoiseach confirm this statement? I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government's continued failure to accede to the Mr. Justice Flood's request, which came to the Oireachtas in the first instance, can be construed as an act of non-compliance and non-co-operation with the Flood tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the request from Mr. Justice Flood, with which the Government intends to comply, was that, at the end of the current module, he would produce an interim report on the tribunal's work to date, but that he would require additional people for the next module. The issue of additional members arises from the next module. There is no delay, interference or disruption to the Flood tribunal in any respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the second issue. There has been considerable difficulty sourcing individuals who are prepared to give years to this work. However, discussions between Mr. Justice Flood and the Attorney General have continued. I am aware of some of the details of the discussions, but I do not wish to divulge names. The discussions are ongoing, but the Government intends to comply well in advance of when Mr. Justice Flood moves to the next module and to provide the additional members he requires.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood specifically requested that this matter be dealt with before the last summer recess. We are now facing another recess so, as far as the judge is concerned, <Col N="477" /> his request has not been complied with by the Government or by the House.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that Deputy Harney confirmed to the House that, under the terms of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, there is no requirement that persons appointed to tribunals are legally qualified. People of other appropriate professions could be appointed. One could envisage circumstances in which, for example, an accountant or quantity surveyor could bring his or her professional skills to the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the best intervention I have heard in the House. That is weak enough. Does the Taoiseach realise the person to be appointed does not have to be legally qualified? It is not sufficient for the Taoiseach to tell the House that there is a reluctance among judges to accept the appointment. One does not have to appoint a judge. One could appoint a senior counsel, solicitor, accountant or quantity surveyor. Nothing in the Act prevents such an appointment for which there are precedents by way of appointing members to a tribunal or an assessor to sit with the sole member of a tribunal. Can the Taoiseach give the House a better answer and a commitment that the work of the Flood tribunal will not be inhibited by the Government's failure to comply with Mr. Justice Flood's legitimate request of last June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of better answers, but of facts. Last summer Mr. Justice Flood asked for the appointment of two additional judges. He did not ask for bricklayers, carpenters or anyone else, but judges. The matter is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>As regards a substitute or alternate, that individual does not have to be a judge or a barrister. My information is that the Attorney General had already told Deputies Quinn and Noonan that a named individual was being considered in that regard. However, it would be unfair to name the individual.</P>

      <P>Yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> carried a story with the banner headline, &ldquo;Our Shame&rdquo;, which highlighted the fact that a 34 year old man who, of necessity, was named by his family and who has spent most of his life in care is in an unbelievable set of circumstances in Cork city. Can the Taoiseach explain how a Government which wrestled for so long with its Estimates and its conscience over a so-called health strategy can preside over a situation in which upwards of 1,000 people are held in conditions which are unacceptable in this day and <Col N="478" /> age? What does the Government intend to do about this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the inspector of mental hospitals has severely criticised the practice of housing persons with mental handicap in accommodation intended for persons suffering from psychiatric illnesses? Is he also aware that the inspector of mental services said this practice was unfair both to patients suffering from psychiatric illnesses and persons with mental disabilities? What is the Government's programme to ensure that the 600 people with mental handicap who are at present accommodated in psychiatric hospitals are housed more appropriately in specialist units?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people with an intellectual disability currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals is 503. In recent years a revenue programme has been designed to create more appropriate settings for persons with an intellectual disability or autism, who are accommodated in psychiatric hospitals. The numbers have been reduced from almost 1,000 and the programme is continuing. Some are accommodated in de-designated units, which were formerly designated for psychiatric services, and others moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodation which is now unsuitable. So far, we have developed a number of places and there have been developments in terms of the legislative rights of such patients. The programme of moving people into suitable accommodation is continuing. A sum of £205 million has been allocated to it and £51.25 million will be spent next year.</P>

      <P>The case I referred to is described in the following way:</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Sullivan is 34, he has spent most of his life in the care of the State. Unable to communicate, he tears at his flesh until he bleeds. He now weighs 4.5 stone.</P>
      <P>In his reply, the Taoiseach stated that the number was just under 600. Is he aware that while there are just under 600 people in designated care, as described by the Taoiseach, there are, according to a press notice from the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, approximately 400 people in what a bureaucratic Kafka-esque phrase describes as &ldquo;de-designated units&rdquo;? We have changed the label of the places in which these people are currently held but they are still there in appalling conditions.</P>
      <P>The same press release from the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped in Ireland points out that in its much lauded and totally derided health strategy, the Government proposes to deal with this problem by the year 2007. In the light of what we now know, is the Taoiseach prepared to reconsider that timetable and bring it forward, since he has the resources? </P>

      <P>The Deputy will agree that halving the list in a short period of time and being involved in an active capital programme in at least ten different places throughout the country is a step in the right direction.

Can the Taoiseach indicate when this Bill will be published so that we can put structures in place to ensure that safe, potable water is available to all consumers?</P>

      <P>We have, in section A of the list published at the commencement of the session, a total of 16 Bills of which two have been published and one, the Appropriation Bill, will be published tomorrow. Since this is the last week of this session, can the Taoiseach tell the House when the Civil Defence Bill, the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill, the Competition Bill, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Central Bank of Ireland Financial Services Authority (No. 1) Bill, the Oireachtas Commission Bill, the Ombudsman for Children Bill, the Disabilities Bill, the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Bill, the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Bill, the Digital Hub Agency Bill, the Railway Safety Bill and the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill will be published?</P>
      <P>I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that there are already published on the Order Paper 11 Bills which have not yet been debated. Is he still insisting that the House will rise at the end of this week and not resume until the end of January? What will he do to get the legislative programme back on track?</P>

The texts of both had just been communicated to my office before I left and I have not seen either of them. Fifty pages are being sent through my fax machine and I understand the same is happening to the Fine Gael spokesman.</P>
      <P>So that we can be orderly on scheduled business tomorrow, without a row, I ask the Taoiseach whether it is necessary to take these matters tomorrow? The Justice Council has not formalised agreement on the second matter. Would it not be more appropriate to give us a little more time to read and reflect upon them and to get advice about them, since it is unlikely that they can be taken on a community basis until at least after the full council meeting this weekend or perhaps a new Justice Council meeting in the new year?</P>

      <P>On the same issue, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last week indicated to the spokespersons that this matter would be taken tomorrow, in the context of agreement being reached at the conference last week, but agreement has not been reached. We do not know to what extent changes may be made in the comprehensive documentation that has just been faxed to our offices. Will the Taoiseach say whether it is appropriate, in the circumstances, to take this tomorrow? It is important, in changing European laws relating to arrest warrants and terrorism, that this House is given reasonable time to consider the complicated legal changes being proposed. It is not appropriate to rush into the debate tomorrow because most Members will not have received any documentation at all and the spokespeople of the main Opposition parties will probably only have an opportunity to look at the documentation late tonight.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cómhbhrón a dhéanamh le clann Sheán Eiffe, a fuair bás Dé hAoine seo caite. Today Detective Sergeant Seán Eiffe is being buried in Ratoath, County Meath. He died in the service of this country and of his fellow citizens. On my own behalf, and that of the Government, I extend my sincere sympathy to his wife, Lorraine, his son, Andrew, and his daughters, Alison, Michelle and Rachel. Their loss is an enormous one and in this Christmas period it is extremely difficult for them. We send our condolences from this House today and offer them our sympathy.</P>
      <P>I also express my sympathy to the Garda Commissioner and all his Garda colleagues. His tragic death is a reminder, if any were needed, to those of us both inside and outside the House of the risks they take in the defence of our community.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in sending, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and other Members of the House, the deepest sympathy to the family of Detective Sergeant Seán Eiffe who lost his life in very tragic circumstances on Friday last. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Lorraine, and their four children and to other members of his family.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is right in saying that the Garda Síochána put their lives at risk for the sake of the community. We do not always give the Garda the recognition they deserve for their service to the community in protecting us by being in the front line in the fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> I also extend our sympathy to the Garda Commissioner and to his colleagues. Detective Sergeant Seán Eiffe was in the force for some 21 years and had an unblemished record. He was thought of very highly by his colleagues and the local community in Ratoath where he was known to be a family man. His loss will be great not just to the Garda force but to the community in which he lived. May he rest in peace.</P>

I wish to convey our sincere condolences to Mrs. Lorraine Eiffe, the wife of Detective Sergeant Seán Eiffe, his four children, Andrew, Alison, Michelle and Rachel and to his own family and the community in Ratoath, County Meath, where he lived and is being buried this evening.</P>
      <P>I also convey our sincere condolences to the Garda Commissioner and to all the members of the force. This is an opportunity for public acknowledgement of the risks that they all take individually and collectively on our behalf in ensuring that our streets and homes are safe. We recognise the service that they delivered to this community over many decades at this hour of their grief. We express sympathy to all concerned.</P>

The House will be aware that eight people were discovered dead and that five others were immediately rushed to Wexford General Hospital. There is now some optimism about the condition of the five survivors, which is some consolation. Our deepest sympathy and thoughts go to the families and friends of all those involved.</P>
      <P>The Garda, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, is involved in a major investigation into this matter which is drawing on the international police co-operation established in the area of human trafficking and smuggling. The contacts which have been made, including those with the UK, French, Belgian and German authorities, have been of great assistance. Europol and Interpol have also been involved in the investigation. I express my gratitude for and acknowledge the full and timely co-operation of all these authorities.</P>
      <P>While Deputies will appreciate the importance of not compromising the ongoing investigation and prejudicing any prosecutions which may result, I can confirm from the reports available to me that significant progress is being made in the investigation and that a number of persons have been interviewed regarding various stages of the container's journey to Ireland. Particular progress has been made in Belgium with regard to a premises which seems likely to have been used as a &ldquo;staging post&rdquo; as part of this trafficking operation. Inquiries appear to indicate that some of the unfortunate victims in this incident may have spent some time in this premises prior to being moved to the container.</P>
      <P>The priority at this time is to ensure the complete recovery of the five survivors and that all their needs are catered for. At this point it is important to pay tribute to all in County Wexford associated with their care. I know the question of asylum or humanitarian leave has been raised and have already said that, when the people concerned are in a position to consider their future, it will be open to them to make such an application to me. I have made it clear that they will receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable work has already been done by the Garda, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, in the difficult task of identifying the deceased. This work has been considerably assisted by the high degree of international co-operation available. The facts I have to hand are <Col N="495" /> that seven of the eight deceased are Turkish nationals who have been positively identified. Five are male, of whom three were minors, aged four, nine and 16 years. The two females included a ten year old girl. One remaining deceased male person has yet to be positively identified, but efforts are continuing.</P>
    <P>The five survivors are believed to be three Turkish, one Albanian and one Algerian nationals. One of the Turkish nationals is a 15 year old boy. A number of relatives of the persons concerned have already travelled to Ireland and are being assisted by the authorities at what is a very difficult time for them. I thank the Turkish Ambassador to Ireland and his staff for their assistance to date.</P>
    <P>A very thorough investigation is continuing, but at this point I would like to inform the House of the details available to me of the container's movements, which are as follows. The container loaded with furniture left Graffignana, near Milan, Italy, on Friday, 30 November and travelled via Cologne, Germany, to Zeebrugge, Belgium, arriving on Tuesday, 4 December. It was loaded on a ship which departed from Zeebrugge at 6 p.m. that evening. The ship arrived in Bellview port in Waterford on Thursday, 6 December, at 10.55 p.m. On Friday, 7 December, the container was loaded on to a truck and stored overnight at the port. On Saturday, 8 December, the truck was collected at 8.10 a.m. and brought to Drinagh business park in Wexford, where the discovery was made shortly after its arrival at 9.10 a.m. All the indications from the investigation so far are that these people were not attempting to travel to Ireland but were attempting to travel to the United Kingdom, a much shorter journey from the port of Zeebrugge.</P>
    <P>This tragedy represents the first incident of this type in Ireland. Sadly, there have been similar tragedies in other countries before. At a Garda conference on co-operation between EU border control services in June, I spoke about the Dover tragedy of last year and stated that it could have happened in any country represented at the conference as all EU member states are potential targets for international criminal gangs which seek to exploit the needs of vulnerable people. Unfortunately, this has proven to be the case.</P>
    <P>Our immigration system must achieve the correct balance in ensuring, on one hand, that the integrity and security of the State and its residents are protected and, on the other, that the rights and interests of immigrants are upheld. In addition, Ireland must afford protection to refugees and fair consideration and care for those claiming protection from persecution while those claims are being determined. The Government's policy regarding asylum and immigration matters is that it is committed to providing protection to refugees and the application of fair procedures in accordance with law to all immigrants, both legal and illegal. We have a fair and balanced asylum system as well as strong legal channels for legal <Col N="496" /> migration in the work permit and work visa schemes. More than 35,000 people have availed of these schemes to date this year. It is anticipated that, by the end of December, 10,000 or so persons will have entered the State this year to make asylum applications here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is clear evidence to show that our immigration system and those of our EU partners are being abused by traffickers and people smugglers. This has clear implications for the security of the State and its residents, particularly in light of the events of 11 September in the United States. It also has implications for the integrity and effectiveness of the asylum system as it operates in Ireland for those who are genuinely in fear of persecution. However, as a member of the family of civilised nations, we must continue to respect the dignity and human rights of all persons who claim asylum here &ndash; irrespective of what may be the eventual outcome of their claim.</P>
    <P>This tragedy shows the callous disregard for human life of those who traffic in human beings. These people have no interest in their victims. They are in this for profit alone.</P>
    <P>International law and criminal justice must target criminals who exploit and abuse the human rights of migrants through human trafficking and smuggling. Any perceived lack of coherence in the approach adopted by border control agencies serves to encourage rather than deter such activities. In light of the Dover tragedy last year, Governments across Europe reaffirmed their commitment to take action to counter people smuggling and trafficking. The Wexford tragedy underlines the need for concerted action and continued effective co-operation throughout Europe to combat those who seek to profit from the trade in human beings. People smuggling and trafficking is an international problem and no one country can operate alone to successfully combat it. It is clear that these challenges require the building of partnerships at all levels between European states at a policy and operational level. It poses challenges for the European Union, for Governments and policy makers generally in terms of the vision of Europe that we seek to support through immigration policy.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a policy of control of the external borders alone will not work. There is a need to work with the countries of origin of migrants to try to tackle the root causes of migration. In many cases this is the result of poverty and lack of opportunity in the countries concerned, rather than persecution. There is a need to help those countries address the issues which give rise to this. There is an onus on the international community, and the west in particular, to encourage the economic development of countries which are the source of migration and to assist them in providing for the needs of their people. The EU's approach of promoting partnership with countries of origin as part of its wider migration and asylum policy is to be encouraged. Ireland's development aid programme also has a role to play here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> At United Nations level, the involvement of organised criminals in trafficking and smuggling of persons was recognised by the United Nations in the Palermo Convention against Transnational Organised Crime signed at the end of last year. It contained two protocols against migrant smuggling and trafficking. The focus is on criminalising the smugglers and traffickers. The protocols also take proper account of the need to treat migrants humanely and to safeguard their human rights, particularly where persons have been the victims of trafficking for exploitation.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I have taken action to deal with people traffickers and smugglers in Ireland. The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, came into effect on 5 September 2000. The purpose of this Act is to target the profiteer or professional smuggler in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and providing a framework by which those engaging in such smuggling can be dealt with under the law. Under the Act, any person who, for profit, intentionally assists illegal immigrants to enter the State may be punished by the imposition of unlimited fines or a term of up to ten years imprisonment or both. The Act covers offences committed outside the State as well as those committed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Garda national immigration bureau, established last year, has had a focus on countering trafficking and smuggling activity and has developed strong operational international liaison which has been evidenced by the progress in this investigation. The first successful prosecution was taken earlier this year and a number of other investigations are pending, with as many as 20 cases currently with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Irish Road Haulage Association agreed a voluntary code of practice with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which had the aim of encouraging greater vigilance to ensure that covert passengers were not present in vehicles arriving in Ireland. This was a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The lesson we must learn from this tragedy is that we cannot lessen our vigilance in the fight against criminals who exploit vulnerable people. This exploitation is a world wide phenomenon and what we have seen in Ireland for the first time this week, in this terrible waste of life, is one instance of what is happening regularly throughout the world. As a member of the EU, Ireland must and will play a full part in, and encourage, concerted action at EU level to counter trafficking and smuggling activity internationally.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that large scale population movements throughout the world have, in recent years and to an extent unknown in the past, become a fact of life. This raises issues of a very fundamental nature, not just for this country or the European Union but for the world as a whole. These are issues which need to be addressed seriously and urgently at an international level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> It does no justice to the issue itself and certainly no justice to the victims of those who callously prey on would-be migrants, to pretend that there are simple solutions. We will get nowhere with debate on this subject if it is seen simply as a matter of point and counter point, based on prejudice and on the refusal to acknowledge that there are genuine complexities. Building arguments, therefore, on false notions to the effect that there are no lawful means of entering the State, that applicants for refugee status do not have their cases heard, that the issue can be dealt with by setting quotas, that trafficking is a side issue, and that no immigrants abuse the system to the detriment of others is just as futile and wrong-headed in terms of genuinely finding solutions as is the pretence that legal solutions and law enforcement measures alone will suffice. We need to work seriously and honestly together, not only here but across the world, to address the underlying causes and to attempt to evolve, at international level, a means of addressing the fact that the large scale movement of people is now part of reality for all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that the tragedy which took place at the weekend is the inevitable result of the development of a &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; mentality across the European Union which is resulting in both economic migrants and those genuinely seeking political asylum becoming increasingly desperate and taking ever more hazardous measures in attempting to gain entry to European Union countries, including Ireland? Does he also acknowledge that the additional vigilance and stricter controls, to which he has referred on many occasions, being put in place to ensure that refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants do not enter the country are the cause of people taking the type of action that resulted in the eight appalling and tragic deaths that occurred at the weekend? Does he further acknowledge that there is a need to put in place across the European Union uniform rules and regulations to allow for access by economic migrants to the EU and also that there is a need to reassess the approach taken by member states, including Ireland, in order to ensure there is a reasonable possibility of access for those who are genuinely seeking political asylum and who can be properly described as political refugees?</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to acknowledge that the movement now taking place within the European Union on a co-ordinated level is more one designed to undermine the rights that refugees currently have under the United Nations Convention on Refugees than to ensure that there is a proper application of the principles contained in that legislation. Could the Minister indicate what new initiatives he now proposes taking to ensure a similar tragedy does not occur either in this State or in another European Union state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>References to this tragedy being a result of the difficulty of access to the EU <Col N="499" /> by nationals of third countries because of a so-called &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; policy, to which Deputy Shatter referred, are misguided. The indications are that the unfortunate victims in this case were already present in the EU before they entered the container with such tragic consequences. They could have claimed asylum in any of the member states in which they were present if that was their intention. If Europe does not take action against those responsible for trafficking and smuggling of persons, it is leaving the stage free for the unscrupulous who ply this evil trade across our Continent. If we do not firmly tackle this activity, we risk creating more victims. Human trafficking and smuggling is a modern-day slave trade and is a very lucrative business for those who control it. We must take action to put these people out of business and assist their victims.</P>
      <P>The European Union is also developing its policy in relation to legal migration, including economic migration. While the numbers who will be entitled to enter each member state will be a matter for the member state, there will be clear procedures for legal entry to the EU. In recent years Ireland has had one of the most open immigration systems for economic purposes in the European Union. For those who wish to come to Ireland for economic reasons, the work permit system has provided possibilities for people from a wide range of skills backgrounds to come to Ireland legally. More than 18,000 people came through this route in 2000 and so far this year more than 35,000 have done so. They come from a wide range of countries. However, there is no evidence that greater opportunities for legal migration will lead to any reduction in illegal migration and trafficking in human persons. International experience is the opposite, that more open migration systems may lead to increased illegal migration to the countries concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Shatter's question as to what is being done to prevent a recurrence of this tragedy, there is a significant level of international co-operation in combating the trafficking and smuggling of persons, which is a growing scourge internationally. It is clear that much activity in this area is being directed by organised criminals. There is increased co-operation and intelligence sharing across Europe, including through Europol. The need for this has been heightened in recent times by the events of 11 September in the United States of America. The sharing of intelligence and operational co-operation between member states is essential if we are to effectively combat the organised international menace of human trafficking and smuggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a practical level in Ireland, the Garda national immigration bureau has been expanded in recent months to deal with the many challenges arising in the immigration area in Ireland. It is taking action to counter traffickers operating into Ireland. In recent weeks the bureau has pur<Col N="500" /> chased equipment to detect the presence of human beings in vehicles. This is now being deployed at a number of ports and other units will be deployed in the coming days. The bureau is also working closely in co-operation with carriers and hauliers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter asked whether the action taken by the Garda Síochána in Cherbourg and Rosslare contributed to this tragedy. The evidence suggests that these people were not attempting to come to Ireland but were attempting to go to the United Kingdom. The co-operation between the Garda national immigration bureau and Irish Ferries in Cherbourg has the objective of tackling the people smuggling and trafficking activity which was operating on the Rosslare-Cherbourg route. People who arrive in Ireland are entitled to claim asylum. It should also be noted that all other EU member states are signatories to the 1951 Refugee Convention to which they must adhere. The unfortunate people who are the victims in this terrible tragedy would have been entitled to claim asylum in Belgium or in any other member state through which they travelled. There is a provision in international law, through a convention known as the Dublin Convention, whereby a person is obliged to make an application for asylum in the signatory country in which he or she first lands where he or she could reasonably have done so. This is international law.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the situation as best I can and will be pleased to take questions from other Deputies or further questions from Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Dover tragedy in June 2000 the Minister stated that it made him more determined to try to ensure the introduction of measures to combat trafficking in human beings and that it was of immense importance to stop it. In the light of the recent tragedy, is the Minister satisfied with the measures he has taken and, if not, what additional measures does he propose to take? In his contribution the Minister said that he wished to thank the Turkish Ambassador. I do not know whether he has had discussions with the Turkish Ambassador. If he has, did he seek to establish why these individuals were seeking to get away from Turkey, a state awaiting entry to the EU? Did he raise this issue? If he did not, has he any intention of doing so? What additional resources have been allocated to the Garda Síochána in Wexford town or to the Garda national immigration bureau to deal with this matter?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that there are provisions for people who do not qualify for refugee status on humanitarian grounds to remain in the country. Can he give an assurance that he will look on this case in a sympathetic light? Could he tell the House how many times these provisions have been invoked and how many asylum seekers who failed to obtain refugee status have been allowed to remain here under that provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> Aside from this tragedy, does it not strike the Minister as strange that a container could come into this country without being checked? Is there any indication from the survivors of this affair that relatives of theirs got into the country in this manner? Is the Minister aware of any other people who did so? Does it not strike him that this container could have brought anything into the country? Does he agree that we need to re-examine our whole system of customs and security checks at various points of entry if such a situation can arise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the measures which have been implemented, the illegal immigrants traffic legislation is quite strict. It provides for unlimited fines, terms of imprisonment of up to ten years and the forfeiture of vehicles. I am satisfied that the measures are sufficiently strict to be a deterrent &ndash; 20 cases are with the Director of Public Prosecutions at present.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Turkish Ambassador. He conveyed to me the thanks of the Turkish nation for the work Ireland has done in relation to this appalling tragedy. I did not seek an explanation from him why some Turkish nationals sought to come here. I do not believe it is something on which he could have assisted me.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of additional resources, I have made it clear that any resources which are required by the Garda Síochána in this matter through the Garda national immigration bureau, which is headed by Chief Superintendent Donnellan, will be provided.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the people concerned being allowed to remain on humanitarian grounds, I have explained that there is provision in legislation which allows for that. I have also indicated that this is something to which I am most sympathetically disposed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of people who were allowed to remain on humanitarian grounds, I do not have that information. However, I can assure the Deputy that this is not an isolated case. Many people have been allowed to stay here on humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>With regard to the containers being checked, I have realised for some time that a tragedy like this could occur. We saw what happened in Dover. I went to France to meet the then Interior Minister, Mr. Chevènement, and explained the difficulties we were having in relation to Cherbourg. I also went to Britain and met the then Home Secretary, Mr. Jack Straw, and explained the difficulties we were having in relation to immigration from Britain. As a result of these discussions, liaison officers were placed in London and Paris. The co-operation which resulted was much greater than had been the case prior to that. It is clearly of immense importance that people are not allowed to get into containers in places like Cherbourg. That presents severe difficulties and in this instance it resulted in the death of the poor unfortunate people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> It is important that international co-operation is enhanced. In that context, I pay tribute to police forces across Europe which have been of enormous benefit to the Garda national immigration bureau in seeking to track down the perpetrators of this awful event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Chair will give some latitude to a Deputy from Wexford who came upon these scenes last Saturday when I visited my local hospital and Drinagh Business Park, where the dreadful sight confronted the driver and the gardaí who opened the container. I express my deepest sympathy to the victims and their families and wish the survivors in Wexford General Hospital well. I compliment the Garda Síochána in Wexford, whose members were extraordinarily professional in the circumstances, and the staff of Wexford General Hospital, led by Dr. Paddy McKiernan, the consultant physician, all of whom rallied in a supportive way to deal with this appalling tragedy.</P>
      <P>The Minister, like me, saw the situation at first hand. Looking into that container and imagining the appalling suffering was to look into hell. If there is a hell, it is what was endured by those people in that steel box as they watched their friends, colleagues and family members die and as they felt their own lives drifting from them. In a matter of a few more hours, there would have been no survivors.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that we need to work seriously and honestly together. Will he accept that his comment that we have a fair and balanced asylum system as well as strong legal channels for legal migration in the work permit and work visa scheme is simply untrue and a sham? There is no mechanism for those people to come legally into this country. Will he accept that the work visa scheme is activated by people who apply here for named individuals? The Government has promised for the past year to put it on a statutory basis but where is the legislation? The Tánaiste has ministerial responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the vast bulk of the 35,000 visas he mentioned are for citizens of developed countries, the computer technologists and other skilled personnel who run our high tech industries? I have the list of numbers. For people in Third World countries or undeveloped countries in eastern Europe, there is little opportunity to be even considered for visas. Will the Minister accept that the current system is due to be reduced because the Tánaiste regards it as a safety valve in the recession we are facing? Will he accept that what is needed is not only a rational asylum policy to deal humanely and efficiently with asylum applications but also a policy to deal with economic migrants in a structured way? The concept of quotas offends one of my colleagues in the Green Party but the European Union must absorb and welcome people in a structured way. I urge the Minister to stop characterising people who disagree with him as being in favour of an open door policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> If the Minister is as honest and shocked as me by what befell my constituents last Saturday and if he is genuinely of the opinion that we must work seriously and honestly together, I invite him to deal with this issue through the following three-stranded strategy. First, there should be a fast track asylum application processing system which, in fairness, the Minister is close to having in place. Second, there should be a green card system whereby economic migrants can apply, on an agreed basis, to live and work freely in this country on a permanent basis. Third, there should be a developed integration and support system for all non-nationals to build a more pluralist society and to attack racism.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is a decent man but his innate conservatism makes him inappropriate for this most difficult and sensitive work. Will the Minister abandon the legalisms and jargon and simply say on the record, in common decency and in fulfilment of what I believe the people want, that if the survivors of this appalling tragedy wish to remain in this county, they will be welcome to do so? Nothing more would be expected.</P>

      <P>&mdash;for a work permit for them. Subsequently, if appropriate, that is, if they are visa nationals, the individuals themselves apply for visas. I cannot accept that the asylum system in this country is unfair. It is fair and balanced. Ireland operates in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees. No human being who arrived on our shores was denied the opportunity to apply for asylum. No human being who ever applied for asylum was denied due process. If, at the end of that process, <Col N="504" /> an individual is found not to be a refugee, there is a provision whereby the individual is asked to leave. Subsequently, there is the issue of deportation.</P>
      <P>Ireland's standards as they apply to asylum seekers are among the best in the world, of that there can be no question. We have endeavoured over the past four years to ensure that each man, woman and child coming to this country to seek asylum was given a roof over their head and was provided for. We succeeded in doing so. Nobody should underestimate the challenge of caring for 10,000 people per year. At times staff in the Department have been attacked for carrying out what is a thankless and difficult task. However, they carry out that task extremely well and I, as Minister, am extremely proud of the way they do so.</P>
      <P>Ireland has not experienced immigration at this level before and the structures and the legislation to deal with the immigration which has been occurring were not in place. Most of the structures and legislation are now in place and we are reaching the stage where every applicant's case can be processed within a period of six months of him or her arriving here. I know that Deputy Howlin is well-intentioned when he speaks about quotas. The difficulty is that it is not possible to impose a quota like that because, under the 1951 convention, every individual who arrives is entitled to apply for asylum.</P>

      <P>This is not the action of a Government that is seeking to discriminate against the nationals of any country. This is the action of a Government which has a broad mind on this matter. Let nobody come into the House and pretend that it is possible to have an immigration system which will cater for everybody's needs irrespective of where they come from. There is a massive movement of people across Europe from east to west, from Africa into Europe and in all places. No one country, certainly not a country as small as this, has the opportunity or even the hope of catering for this problem.</P>

      <P>I accept that Deputy Howlin is well-intentioned and that his proposals are put forward from a humanitarian perspective. I respect him for that but let us be clear. If there is to be progress in relation to the question of immigration and if people from underdeveloped countries are to be assisted, the sources from which those people come must be looked at and those countries assisted. It cannot be done by one small country. It has to be done at international level through international co-operation. People in those countries must be assisted to have reasonable livelihoods at home. That may seem a very high aspiration to have, but it is a more realistic aspiration than Deputy Howlin's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is because we do not have a proper immigration policy, something that applies across Europe, that asylum seekers are very often forced into the hands of unscrupulous traffickers? Does he accept that, in a globalised world where we have free movement of goods, services and capital, it is inevitable that we will also have the movement of people? How does the Government intend to deal with the very fundamental problems of globalisation, which are the root cause of this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister apply the Dublin Convention? Is it applied selectively so that there will <Col N="506" /> be no deportations when the media are watching and that we can give asylum seekers sympathy? Is it when the eye is off the ball that we deal unfairly with people? In relation to the concept of fortress Europe, does the Minister accept the proposals for European border guards put forward by Antonio Vitorino, the EU Commissioner with responsibility in this area, an idea also supported by Commissioner Prodi? This is a prime example of fortress Europe. How does the Minister feel about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that we do not have an immigration policy. We have a very sophisticated immigration policy which has been built up in recent years. It is among the most sophisticated immigration policies in Europe. I do not know how Deputy Gormley has come to the conclusion that we do not have an immigration policy. I suspect that because he does not agree with the immigration policy we have, he likes to suggest that we do not have a policy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the application of the Dublin Convention, the convention has not worked, is not working and has little hope of working. The Dublin Convention provides that a person must make his or her application, where he or she reasonably could have done so, at the port of first entry. The difficulty is that it can be very problematic to establish precisely where an individual came from in the absence of co-operation. The European Union is developing the Eurodac system which will provide that fingerprints can be exchanged to prevent multiple applications for asylum across EU member states. However, that has not yet been established and, even when it is, I am not sure that the Dublin Convention will be effective.</P>
      <P>There is no unfair treatment of people. They are treated fairly. They make their application for asylum and are entitled to appeal that decision to an independent appeals authority. Some can then seek judicial review in the High Court on the basis that the procedures applied were not proper. At all times, due process is observed. People are entitled to free legal aid and to interpretative facilities. I do not know of an equivalent system in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gormley has again brought up the question of fortress Europe. I cannot say that the Deputy is correct in relation to this. Fortress Europe is nothing other than a state of mind. I say this because Ireland has had in the past year about 10,000 applicants for asylum, and about 5% more than that in the previous year. Many of the people concerned had to transgress European states to get here. Britain, France, Germany and other major states of the EU will have many more applicants than Ireland. In Britain, the figure was close to 80,000 last year. In France and Germany, the figures are probably similar or higher. That does not indicate a fortress Europe to me. That Ireland has one of the highest number of applicants for asylum per head of population in the European Union neither indicates to <Col N="507" /> me a fortress Europe nor, indeed, an asylum system which militates against people's fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>There have in the past been many misconceptions in relation to the asylum system in this country. I fundamentally disagree with people who have those misconceptions, because that is what I describe them as. That is not to say I do not agree that people should be treated with dignity and that we should apply our laws humanely, and we certainly endeavour to do that.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister agree that the appalling deaths of the eight refugees in a shipping container in Wexford is a shocking modern day reverberation of the Famine coffin ships from our own history, with the difference being that instead of oppressed, poor and dispossessed Irish people fleeing our blighted island, today's victims are the oppressed, poor and dispossessed of other troubled countries seeking a haven on these islands?</P>
      <P>Is it true some of the victims are Kurdish people? If so, they are coming from a country in which their nationality, language and culture are routinely and brutally repressed by the Government whose ambassador the Minister thanked in his reply. The policies of those Governments are what has driven many of these people out. Does the Minister agree it is an outrage that such people are forced to put themselves in the hands of cut-throat and gangster traffickers because the Government is blocking a system whereby people can come here safely to apply for refuge under the Dublin Convention? Does he agree the Dublin Convention is pushing people into the hands of traffickers? In the case of the Kurdish people, for example, there is a substantial Kurdish community in Britain. Is it not natural that Kurds fleeing further persecution will want to go to where they have perhaps neighbours or relatives rather than being isolated in a country in mainland Europe which the Dublin Convention dictates given that they have to come overland in most cases? Therefore, is there not a compelling case for an immediate change in this policy?</P>

      <P>The situation in relation to a person arriving in Europe, in a signatory state to the Dublin Convention, is that he or she makes his or her application where he or she could first reasonably do so. That is the law. I did not write that law, it is international law. If, for example, a person arrives in Belgium, France or Germany first, he or she is obliged to make his or her application there if he or she could reasonably do so. If the person is a refugee, as Deputy Higgins <Col N="508" /> states, the individual concerned will be granted refugee status where he or she makes the application. A person who is granted refugee status has the same rights and privileges as a citizen and, therefore, such a person would be in a position to travel on to meet his or her relatives in Britain or in any other part of the European Union for the simple reason that he or she would have refugee status.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister convey the sympathies of all of us in the House to the families of the people who lost their lives, to those who are dangerously ill in hospital, to those who have been assisting the sick people and to the unfortunate truck driver who made the discovery? One can only imagine how appalling it was for him and anybody else there &ndash; I believe a couple of gardaí were there as well. The Minister mentioned that one person has been convicted under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House what sentence was handed down in that case, when he expects the other 20 cases to come before the courts and whether the Director of Public Prosecutions will prosecute them.</P>
      <P>Although it may be too soon, will the Minister tell the House what discussions he had with the Turkish Ambassador about funerals for the people who lost their lives? Will they be returned to their countries? Does he have any assurances that no members of their families will be victimised in any way or discriminated against if these people are brought home for burial, whether in Turkey or Albania? What discussion has taken place on that matter?</P>
      <P>On the road hauliers voluntary code, perhaps the Minister will tell us what is in it, or let me have a copy of it so I can see exactly what road hauliers are expected to do. Is it clear yet at what point these people entered the container? Did they enter it in Italy or in Zeebrugge?

      <Col N="509" /> Is the Minister satisfied that police forces in places like Belgium are doing what they can to prevent this sort of exploitation and trafficking given that as soon as the police force in Belgium was contacted, it was able to identify the house from which it thinks these people came or in which the people trafficking them lived? It means it had that house under surveillance. Why did it not move sooner to get the people carrying on this dastardly trade?</P>

Will the Minister acknowledge that a green card system with reasonable agreed quotas would allow persons who are economic migrants to come to this State and would separate such persons from those genuinely seeking political asylum? Will he acknowledge that in his reply to Deputy Howlin he was wrong to raise the issue of quotas in the context of political refugees or those seeking political asylum? No Member of this House is raising that issue in this context. It is time we addressed the issue of a green card system and put in place arrangements in this State which we have urged on other states in the past in the context of our nationals who sought to work abroad.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Owen, I will certainly convey the sympathy of the House to the families of those who lost their lives and to the truck driver who has been traumatised. That would be most appropriate. I understand that one person has been convicted of trafficking. I do not know the precise sentence that is applicable under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act. I will communicate that to Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>With regard to her question on the road hauliers code, road hauliers agree they will carry out certain checks to ensure, in so far as they can, that they are not carrying illegal immigrants unknowingly. It is intended to bring forward carriers' liability legislation. I will furnish the Deputy with a copy of the code.</P>
      <P>It was asked at what point the container was opened and at what stage the unfortunate people entered the container. It is believed, but not certain, that they entered the container in Belgium. There was certainly evidence that the seal had been broken. There was also evidence that there was silicone used to camouflage the fact that the seal had been broken. It is clear to the authorities that somebody assisted the unfortunate people into the container. Of that there is no doubt.</P>

      <P>Europe's future is an enlarged, efficient and democratic European <Col N="512" /> Union and Ireland's future is at the centre of this enlarged, efficient and democratic EU. Ireland's full and committed participation in such a European Union will be for the good of Europe and the good of Ireland, yet facing into 2002 Ireland stands in danger of being in a minority of one in the European Union as the only member state that will not have ratified the Treaty of Nice.</P>
      <P>Last month the European Commission issued a report which suggests that ten of the 12 applicant countries will have wrapped up negotiations before the end of next year. At that stage Ireland could be staring into the abyss of isolation, solely impeding and certainly delaying the enlargement of the EU. The damage to Ireland of being so isolated would be enormous. Enlargement of the EU is very clearly in our national interest and nearly all of those who opposed the referendum on the Treaty of Nice made it clear they supported enlargement.</P>
      <P>Every democratic European state has the right and entitlement to join the EU and enlargement of the EU is, for Ireland and all the other member states, nothing less than an historical, economic, consumer, social, environmental and above all a moral imperative. The EU's member states therefore have the duty to ensure the swiftest possible accession of the applicant states, a task that will finally put an end to the Cold War and the consequent division of Europe.</P>
      <P>Enlargement will reunite the peoples of central and eastern Europe with their brethren in today's European Union and will consolidate democracy, human rights and the rule of law as well as strengthening peace and security throughout the entire Continent of Europe, including the Balkans. Without enlargement the EU will not reach its full potential. The new member states will reap the economic benefits of permanent access to the markets of today's EU and Ireland in turn will benefit from permanent and guaranteed access to our goods and services from the markets of the EU, which will have increased by approximately 100 million new customers. Europe's environment will be transformed with the new member states having to comply with exacting EU requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is clear that the context of the debate has changed considerably since last June in that the pace of enlargement negotiations has accelerated for nearly all applicant countries, giving rise to the latest Commission report confirming that ten of them are not just knocking at but rather are halfway through the door to EU membership. What is needed now is leadership to confront the reality of the situation as it is now rather than as it was in the past. That reality involves steps being taken now to ensure Ireland does not impede or delay the accession of applicant states. Already questions are being asked throughout Europe as to where we stand on the issue. It is therefore important that this Parliament should state clearly and unequivocally that <Col N="513" /> it supports enlargement of the EU and that we do not want to impede or delay it.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we have a full appreciation of the consequences of rejecting enlargement. It is inconceivable that 1% of the population of the EU would be able to stop the march of history. Undoubtedly, if Ireland is blocking enlargement a creative solution will be found at EU level which will probably provide a mechanism to enable enlargement to go ahead. Ireland would then be faced with unenviable choices and it is important to examine those choices.</P>
    <P>The most extreme option would be a complete withdrawal from the EU, though some might say there is no provision in the treaty for such an eventuality. However, <i>de facto</i> of course it would be possible and there is already a precedent for a province or territory administered by a member state to withdraw. Greenland created that precedent but it is not one that is in our interests to follow in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>We first made overtures to join Europe in 1961 and it took us 12 years to get in. Those who really want us out of the EU should consider it might take only the next 12 months to achieve that objective, a prospect at which I shudder. I do not expect that to happen but it is one of the options that will confront us if we persist with a position in which we effectively reject enlargement.</P>
    <P>Another possibility is that a new legal structure could be created to accommodate the other 14 member states which support enlargement and the 12 applicant countries. Effectively, we would be on the outer margins in a type of shadow or shell EU without power or influence of any kind on further developments in the EU. We should not underestimate the legal ingenuity of the EU in coming up with creative ideas to resolve obstacles in the way of political imperatives &ndash; enlargement is a political imperative for most member states and of course for the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>Schengen is an example of a creative solution. The arrangements for the euro on 1 January could also be so considered in that it is going ahead without the UK, Denmark and Sweden. Being in a Euro-shell away from the centre holds no attractions for me and this view would be shared throughout the country. While we would have access to the internal market, we would have virtually no influence and little claim on EU funding whether it is the CAP or regional, social or cohesion funds. To coin a phrase, we would undoubtedly lose power, money and influence.</P>
    <P>If we support enlargement, as the people of Ireland do, it is essential that we learn lessons from the Treaty of Nice referendum. Those lessons have not been learned by the Government, as it has failed to put forward proposals of any kind for debate or consideration as to the way forward. Whether this arises from inertia, apathy, wanting to avoid the issue until after the election or just absence of leadership is not clear.</P>
    <P>The consequences of further delay are clear, however. If one believes it is necessary to learn lessons from the failure of the referendum and <Col N="514" /> that it is necessary to put in place measures before this issue is put before the people again, we must use the time available. However, we need proposals to put in place such measures.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I have put forward proposals on behalf of Fine Gael. I have made it clear that enlargement of the European Union can best be achieved through the adoption of the Nice treaty by all 15 EU members. Others may put forward a different approach and I am particularly anxious to hear the Government's proposals. It is absolutely critical that we learn from the electorate's rejection of the Nice treaty last June, which stemmed from concerns about military neutrality and our perceived remoteness from the European Union. It is easy to argue that these issues do not arise in the Nice treaty, but we have to confront the perceptions of the public. It is important that six issues are addressed before the Nice treaty is the subject of a further referendum. Action is needed from the Government, as all it has done so far is reflect, examine, analyse and delay. The Government has achieved paralysis by analysis. I wish to address some of the six points in my party's consultation document, which has been published to inspire discussion.</P>
    <P>An EU declaration confirming that nothing in the Nice treaty obliges Ireland to introduce conscription or to be involved in a European army is needed. It may be argued that such a declaration is unnecessary, but many people expressed concerns about military matters during the referendum campaign. The results of a questionnaire which was distributed with my consultation document show that people are worried about such matters. It is important that I make clear that Ireland is not and cannot be neutral in the war against international terrorism, ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights. The Fine Gael Party favours open involvement in discussions on peace and security in the European Union. Military neutrality is not compromised if we ensure that decisions on participation in military operations are made by our sovereign Government and Parliament. It may be necessary to spell out that we intend to preserve sovereignty as I have no doubt that scare stories about Ireland participating in foreign missions and introducing conscription against the will of the people led to great confusion during the referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>The European Union declaration to which I referred must specifically affirm that nothing in the Nice treaty obliges Ireland to join a European army or to introduce conscription. It must be made absolutely clear that future participation by the Defence Forces in missions under the European flag, for example, as part of the Rapid Reaction Force, will be subject to the exclusive consent of Dáil Éireann and the Government. Any such declaration must be underpinned by domestic legislation. I appreciate that it takes time to deal with these issues, but to ignore them will get us nowhere. I do not suggest that we abandon military neutrality by joining NATO or any <Col N="515" /> organisation with a mutual defence pact, but a comprehensive White Paper should be produced to address the issue of military neutrality in the new Europe and in an uncertain world.</P>
    <P>I am not sure there is a huge difference between the Government and Fine Gael on this matter, but I should make one point clear. During the campaign on the Nice treaty referendum, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasised that we will not take part in a military mission that does not have the approval of the UN Security Council. I do not agree that Russia or China should have a veto on Irish operations. Military neutrality means that a sovereign decision can be made by the Irish Parliament and Government.</P>
    <P>A range of issues needs to be dealt with at home. I am glad the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Durkan, is here tonight. I propose an enormous increase in powers for the committee. It should have sufficient resources to enable it to examine, track and report on all policy and legislative proposals made by the European Commission. The committee should have the power to vet nominees to European institutions, such as the Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. Such nominees should not be allowed to take up posts in European institutions without having been approved by the Joint Committee on European Affairs. The committee's reports should be regularly debated in this House.</P>
    <P>A copy of my document, which contains the six-point plan, is available in the Oireachtas Library and I am willing to circulate it to interested parties. One of the proposals in the document is that much greater powers be given to the Seanad. I suggest that representatives of the European Commission and Council be allowed to regularly attend the other House to report on European legislative proposals and policies. Irish members of the European Parliament and Deputies who are members of the committee on European affairs should be able to attend Seanad debates and hearings on European matters. I see the Seanad as a bridgehead to Europe.</P>
    <P>I strongly propose the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, attached to the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach. Such a Minister of State would be allowed to attend Cabinet meetings and would be responsible for co-ordinating Government and departmental policy in the area of European affairs. My consultation document, currently under consideration by members of the Fine Gael Party, proposes a major review of the functions of the Referendum Commission. My colleagues have responded to a questionnaire which I submitted with the document and the results of the survey will be published shortly. Members of my party generally support the <Col N="516" /> approach suggested in the consultation document.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has laid out its stall on these issues. The proposals were criticised as prescriptive, but they are not meant to be so. They are included in a memorandum which is intended to facilitate consultation and discussion. Fine Gael has demonstrated its concern about European issues by setting out specific proposals which should be debated. I call on the Government to stir itself out of its inertia and apathy. It should either accept the Fine Gael proposals, in whole or in part, or put forward an alternative approach. Time is not on our side and certain measures, which will take time to arrange, are necessary before we go back to the people. We need to use our time while it is still available.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will say at the Laeken summit this weekend. Will our European colleagues be given an outline of preparations for a second Nice treaty referendum, including additional measures to be taken before the poll? Will the Taoiseach continue to pretend that he is tackling the problem by reflection, examination and analysis? I am certain Ireland's political credit in Europe will be further diminished if the Taoiseach persists in the latter approach.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Ó Caoláin intends to table an amendment to my motion. I am not sure whether it is in order to refer to the amendment, but the proposal it outlines amounts to a prescription for withdrawal from the European Union. I am glad that Sinn Féin stands for military neutrality and I presume it is now prepared to condemn those who take arms, other than by the sovereign decision of the Government. I am not sure it is worth dwelling on Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment, as it is clear that Irish people support enlargement of the European Union. The Government needs to put forward proposals to ensure that we achieve that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am honoured to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to emphasise the points made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. The eyes of Europe and, in many ways, the eyes of the world are on Ireland in an effort to determine what we propose to do about the Treaty of Nice. The treaty was rejected by the people and, rightly or wrongly, the Government established a forum which is in session. There is a general opinion, which I share, that the forum is not achieving the intended results. However, without doubt the applicant countries throughout Europe are deeply concerned as to what Ireland is doing to address the issues raised in the Treaty of Nice and rejected by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be clear that we cannot afford to proceed as if nothing happened and on the basis that things will be all right next time if we do nothing in the meantime. We cannot afford to assume that the people will change their minds because they know a little more about the issues. There is a grave danger that the reverse might <Col N="517" /> happen and that, having learned more about the issues, the people might vote in a way which would not be advantageous to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Two issues present themselves as we go forward, first, whether the Government will have to intervene in the debate with our European colleagues and set out certain parameters within which it might be possible for Ireland to proceed having regard to the people's decision. There is no sense in suggesting that, with a bit of luck, the people will give a different decision next time. Such an approach would be dangerous. I share the opinion that the danger is that we would relax, go back to the people and get a worse decision. Where will we be then?</P>
    <P>The second problem is the short amount of time available. There will be an election and various referenda within the coming year. The possibility of ratifying the treaty by this time next year is difficult at best and slim at worst. Such a scenario would create a more serious problem. The question being asked throughout Europe is whether Ireland, as a former leading member of the EU, is serious about European enlargement and the European project in general. The only thing we have to go on at this stage is the decision of the people in the referendum and we will have to come up with something else.</P>
    <P>The kind of declaration referred to should be worked on as a matter of extreme urgency with a view to identifying the areas within which the Government can present to the European Presidency what it sees as the means whereby we will at least have a fighting chance when we go back to the people. I say so notwithstanding the McKenna judgment and the other issues involved. There are issues which we can address and do something about in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, is deeply committed to the European project as are his officials and the Department. However, I am not sure that all members of the Government and all its backbenchers are as deeply committed to the project as the Minister. That is unfair to the Minister, to this country and to the EU.</P>
    <P>What are we to do? We must consider a declaration which, I hope, will give some indication as to the parameters within which the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 is likely to emerge. In other words, we must round off some of the concerns expressed during the recent debate and encompass them in the next Intergovernmental Conference in such a way as to reassure those concerned and ourselves that there is nothing with which we are unhappy. Such a process can, and should, be undertaken at Laeken.</P>
    <P>One week ago at a meeting in Brussels organised by the EU Presidency, the European affairs committees of the various member states adopted a document for submission to Laeken which contained no reference to the fact that one country had rejected the Nice treaty in a referendum. I could not understand this omission which I pointed out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> I wish to refer to an issue that is important to the whole question of European enlargement and to the future of Europe. This issue will be referred to by those writing the history of Europe in 50 or 60 years' time. Up to 1990 or 1991 there was a vision of what Europe should, and could, be and the reasons it had to be that way. Those reasons were the Cold War, the events of the Second World War and the need to put matters together in such a way that Europe would be an entity going in the same direction as opposed to its member states fighting with each other. These factors remained constant until 1990 and 1991.</P>
    <P>However, the situation has changed since and no one seems to know what comprises the vision of Europe. Almost every European country has its own vision in this regard. During the course of the debate on the Nice treaty scarcely a day went by without some leading European politician making a speech which contradicted one made the day before, a process which was not helpful to the debate taking place in this country. In this day of modern technology, surely it is possible to get people to at least be in the same choral society, if not singing from the same hymn sheet. If the Minister can do something at Laeken to convince our colleagues of this fact he will have done a great day's work which will bear rich fruit in the foreseeable future. If a vision of Europe is not identified, the vision will change and become flexible with every year which passes, depending on the political situation in any part of the EU. Such a scenario might suit some, but it would not suit Ireland. That is the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to the possible outcomes. What options are available if the worst happens and we are unable to ratify the Treaty of Nice? Such a scenario would be a disaster for this country and for the Union as we would become second class citizens within the EU. Such circumstances would severely impact on everything for which the EU stands and 50 or 60 years of hard work in putting together a cohesive Europe could be set aside. Some suggest there is no possibility of such an outcome. However, one would not have been believed if one suggested before the referendum that it could be defeated. No one would have believed such a prediction until the last three or four days before polling. Some of us had a different view.</P>
    <P>All Members would support the view that it is important for this country that we maintain the major role we have played in Europe to date. We have played a major role in stabilising Europe and we have a large role to play in the future with all other small member states and the applicant countries. If we fail to move the agenda forward and be seen to be active, we will fail the Union. It is not beyond us to address this issue and move the debate on by making proposals to our European colleagues.</P>
    <P>There will be no salvation for Ireland or any small country if we occupy the lower tier in a two-tier Europe. Let there be no doubt that in such a scenario, small countries are pushed to one side <Col N="519" /> and control remains in the hands of the larger states. A serious price will be paid in the event of a two-speed or two-tier Europe which some may contemplate. We should recall recent debates regarding opposition to global economies and so on. We in this country know better than most what it is like to be dependent on one neighbour or trading partner, particularly when that partner is a stronger and more powerful one.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. It is good that we are having this debate. We do not debate European matters enough, despite the fact that in the future Europe will affect our lives to a much greater extent than in the past. I hope the Minister will be able to influence the situation in Laeken in a way which will be positive and constructive and will give hope to the applicant countries as well as to the existing members of the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my Fine Gael colleagues for sharing their time with me.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in supporting the Fine Gael motion. Neither do I have difficulty in supporting the amendment proposed by Deputy Ó Caoláin. The Green Party made it clear throughout the Nice treaty campaign that we supported enlargement. We repeated that declaration of support over and over again throughout the campaign. Of course, many people were opposed to enlargement. It was clear from the result of the referendum and from anecdotal and empirical evidence that people were concerned about the fact that we were about to become net contributors to the European Union. That is an indication of a certain selfishness but it would be foolhardy not to recognise this as a factor in the defeat of the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>How do we proceed to achieve enlargement without the Nice treaty? It is important that we clarify the Government's position. We have heard over and over again that the Government has not made up its mind with regard to Nice II. Yet, when I speak to my colleagues in Germany and elsewhere they make it clear that the Irish Government has made a decision to hold a second referendum. The Taoiseach has said the Government will have to revisit the subject. How does one revisit this subject if not through a new referendum? I would like clarification on that subject this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pieces of the jigsaw have been put in place. As the McKenna judgment unravels we see that the Government parties and others have no time for the Referendum Commission and it looks as if it is to be dealt a severe blow. Blame has been placed on the commission for the defeat of the referendum. Is it not curious that people dislike the idea of giving the public impartial information? I supported the Government's Referendum Commission legislation and voted with <Col N="520" /> the Government on that occasion because I believed the commission was a very good idea.</P>
    <P>The problem with the commission was that it was not given sufficient time. It was recommended that it be given a lead-in time of approximately 90 days, but that was not done. People in the Referendum Commission told me at the time of the Nice treaty campaign that there was total chaos in the commission, as a great amount of information had to be published in the required format. Other formats could have been used if the commission had been given time. It is clear that the commission is to be shelved and this is regrettable. This sends out a signal to ordinary people that the Government does not really want them to know the truth. When it comes to Nice II, I will have no hesitation in telling people the Government did not want them to have the information about the treaty.</P>
    <P>A number of Members have referred to the idea of a two-speed Europe, with the bigger states taking control. They are right and that is precisely what I said during the referendum campaign. What is the Nice treaty about? It is not just about enlargement. There is no such thing as a free lunch. In the Nice treaty the bigger states said yes to enlargement but they wanted something in return. What they got was the reweighting of the votes on the Council of Ministers, enhanced co-operation, the removal of vetoes, the incorporation of the Western European Union into the European Union and the establishment of the military and security committee.</P>
    <P>People like Mr. Noel Dorr fought very valiantly at the time of the Amsterdam treaty to stop enhanced co-operation but it remained on the agenda. This will lead to a two-tier Europe. Deputy Durkan says he wants to avoid such a development but if we go ahead with the Nice treaty that is what we will get.</P>
    <P>Can enlargement be achieved in the absence of Nice? Following the referendum, Mr. Prodi visited Ireland and confirmed the stance of those of us who said enlargement can go ahead. He was clear about that point. Mr. Verheugen, the Commissioner for enlargement said the same thing, although he subsequently changed his opinion. In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times </i>Mr. Ben Tonra said enlargement could go ahead. It was not clear what Mr. Tonra had in mind and I would be interested to hear his opinion regarding the reweighting of votes on the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan expressed the opinion that a declaration would solve our difficulty. The Green Party is not seeking a declaration. We want a protocol. We have been told over and over again that not an iota of the treaty can be changed and, therefore, a protocol is not possible. Yet, when we were discussing the abortion referendum, in answer to a question on the Maastricht protocol, the Taoiseach told the House that there was no problem with regard to protocols because &ldquo;they <Col N="521" /> can be nodded through&rdquo;. If a protocol can be nodded through that easily, surely one can be nodded through in relation to the Nice treaty. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter this evening.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Ministers will attend the Laeken summit next week and no doubt they will promise their European colleagues that they will hold a second referendum and that everything will be fine. This sends a message to the Irish people that we can have our little bit of democracy and vote as many times as we like but we must keep voting until we give the right answer. Surely this gives a clear message about the democratic deficit. The message is one of arrogance and contempt.</P>
    <P>In last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> Mr. Stephen Collins wrote about the attitude of anti-Nice campaigners who maintain there are no negative consequences for the country in voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; again because the rest of the EU will be legally bound by that decision. Of course, that is legally the case. Mr. Collins goes on to say: &ldquo;Unfortunately this cloudcuckooland approach to politics will have devastating consequences for Ireland if a majority of those who vote are foolish enough to believe it for a second time.&rdquo; It is Mr. Collins's opinion that we supporters of the No to Nice campaign are in cloudcuckooland. It is incredibly arrogant to think that those of us who believe in the legal way of doing things are living in cloudcuckooland. He goes on: &ldquo;Technically they are right but practically they are hopelessly wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am in this House because I believe in legality and that there is a right way of doing things. One cannot say it is all very well to pass laws but that they do not really matter. That sort of approach has brought us the many recent tribunals but, nevertheless, it will be endorsed by certain journalists and probably by the entire political establishment. Europe is at a crossroads and we have an opportunity to re-examine the entire project and ask if we want a federalist or an inter-governmental approach. I am unashamedly pro-European. If it is Boston versus Berlin, I choose Berlin. My approach is also unashamedly inter-governmental. I do not want a federal Europe and if we go down that road, more and more people will be alienated from the European project. I say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to enlargement, but &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Nice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I affirm the Government's broad support for the thrust of the motion and thank Fine Gael for tabling it. It offers this House a worthwhile opportunity to address an issue of fundamental importance for Ireland and for Europe. In particular, I hope that everyone in Dáil Éireann is <Col N="522" /> prepared to confirm their support for the enlargement of the European Union and to do all they can to ensure that Ireland does not impede or delay the accession of applicant states.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government is taking all appropriate steps within its power to ensure that enlargement can proceed on schedule. However, it is important to realise that this is an issue which should rightly concern not just the Government, but everyone in Ireland, inside and outside the Oireachtas, who is committed to the development of the European Union and to achieving its goals of peace, stability and prosperity in Europe. Those aspirations are shared widely in this House, including by the Fine Gael Party which has an honourable tradition of support for Ireland's national interest in Europe, irrespective of the political complexion of the Government of the day. It is good that it has today demonstrated its willingness to participate in the national debate.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that the endorsement of the Treaty of Nice changes needed to bring enlargement about is ultimately a matter for the people. It is they, and not us, whom we need to convince to demonstrate their support for enlargement by endorsing the institutional changes required for it. For that reason I query any assumption implicit in the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;, that it is somehow possible or desirable for the Government to set or adhere to a timetable which does not reflect and respect the serious public concerns about the Union which were revealed in last June's referendum.</P>
    <P>However, the fact that the Government is continuing to consider how best to address these concerns, in particular as they are being explored within the National Forum on Europe, must not be taken as implying any ambivalence or hesitation on fundamentals. It is the clear and united position of the Government that enlargement must proceed on schedule and that this requires the ratification of the Treaty of Nice by all member states of the European Union, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The enlargement issue has continued to develop and firm up since the referendum. This time next year should see the end of negotiations for the accession of up to ten new members of the EU. The highest political priority is being given, both by the members states and by the candidate countries, to making it happen. Negotiations are continuing in line with the Commission's road map strategy and the majority of candidate countries are proceeding well in their preparations for EU membership. This assessment is endorsed by the Commission in its strategy paper on the enlargement process, published last month. The Commission paper confirms that it should be possible to complete negotiations by the end of 2002 for those candidates that are ready and makes clear that a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; entry of <Col N="523" /> ten new members together is highly probable. The objective set by the European Council in June in Gothenburg, that they should be able to participate as members in the European Parliament elections of June 2004, remains achievable.</P>
    <P>These views are shared by the Governments of all the EU member states. At the General Affairs Council yesterday we recorded this agreement in a set of conclusions which will be endorsed by heads of state and Government at the Laeken European Council on Friday and Saturday. The tempo of the accession negotiations has undoubtedly increased during this year. We have now reached a point where substantive and, at times, difficult issues are being addressed and solved in the negotiations and real progress is being achieved. This was confirmed yesterday and today in Brussels at a meeting of the accession conferences, where both member states and candidate countries agreed to finish discussions on several sensitive chapters or policy areas.</P>
    <P>An important conclusion of the Commission strategy paper is that the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin in 1999, which provide the framework for the financial aspects of enlargement, are adequate to accommodate the accession of up to ten new member states. Ireland welcomes this clear statement; it concurs with our own estimation that for the purposes of enlargement there is no need to re-negotiate such fundamental agreements. The accession process is based on the principle of differentiation, whereby each candidate proceeds towards accession according to its own merits and level of preparedness. The speed with which they have adapted in recent times to the demands of EU membership is a tribute to their political leaders across the spectrum and a tribute to their people, who must carry through the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>For this year there have been no major problems or requests from the candidate countries to which Ireland cannot agree. We do not underestimate the very difficult political choices these countries have to make. Ireland judges each transition request by the candidates on its merits, with an open mind and a full understanding that candidates, in certain areas, have particular needs which must be taken into account in a spirit of fairness and flexibility. However, in being sensitive to the specific short-term adjustment needs of individual candidates, Ireland, like all other member states, will want to be satisfied that any transitions granted to candidates do not distort the functioning of the Single Market, a corner stone of the EU.</P>
    <P>Enlargement is, therefore, a profoundly important development not just in the history of the European Union, but in the history of Europe. It is in Ireland's economic interests, including in the areas of trade, investment and agriculture, as was made clear in the two forum <Col N="524" /> sessions devoted to those topics. It is in Ireland's political interests to see a stable Europe and a European Union in which small states form a clear majority. There is, rightly, a strong consensus in this House and more widely that we should do all we can to support it and bring it about.</P>
    <P>We are doing so in a number of ways. Ireland is playing an active and positive role in the formulation of the Union's detailed positions in the continuing negotiations. Through the so-called &ldquo;twinning&rdquo; scheme, a number of Irish officials are, or have been, seconded to work in candidate country administrations offering practical advice based on our own experience of adaptation to the demands of membership. We offer financial support to their officials to come to Ireland to take part in courses and seminars. We are expanding our network of diplomatic missions in the candidate countries, with the recent opening of embassies in Cyprus, Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia supplementing those in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. This means that we are much better placed than before to interact with them on an informed and intensive basis. My Department and I also value our useful dialogue with the embassies of the candidate countries in Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, the most critical and significant thing we have to do, with our existing partners in the EU, is to make the institutional changes necessary for enlargement. The necessity that further treaty change takes place before enlargement was recognised in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Unfortunately, during the Treaty of Nice referendum campaign, and since, the contents of the Amsterdam treaty and specifically its protocol on enlargement have been repeatedly misrepresented. It was suggested that up to five new member states could join without treaty change. This is not what the protocol said. It envisaged some treaty change taking place before any new member joined. It is untrue that five new members could have joined on an unchanged basis. The protocol also stipulated that at least one year before membership of the Union exceeded 20, there would be a comprehensive review of the treaty's institutional provisions. I do not know how people can, in good faith, read that deadline for further change as allowing enlargement to proceed without change.</P>
    <P>It is almost certain that many more than five new members will join at or around the same time. While this was apparent even before the referendum, the situation has crystallised further since then, as set out in the Commission's report last month. Even if the minimalist interpretation of the Amsterdam protocol was true, which it is not, it has ceased to be relevant. I note that none of those who have sought to rely on it has taken the logical step of selecting which five of the applicants they would choose to admit and which <Col N="525" /> they would tell to wait outside for some indefinite period.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the launch of last year's intergovernmental conference, which led to the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice, the intentions of the EU and the purpose of the Intergovernmental Conference could not have been clearer. The Cologne European Council of June 1999 decided that:</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the European Union's institutions can continue to work efficiently after enlargement, the European Council confirms its intention of convening a Conference.early in 2000 to resolve the institutional issues left open in Amsterdam that need to be settled before enlargement.</P>
    <P>Six months later in Helsinki it was declared that:</P>
    <P>The Union has made a firm political commitment to make every effort to complete the Intergovernmental Conference on institutional reform by December 2000, to be followed by ratification. After ratification of the results of that Conference the Union should be in a position to welcome new Member States from the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>It has, therefore, been the consistent and settled view of the European Union for over four years that further institutional changes are required for enlargement to proceed. Those institutional changes were negotiated during 2000. The marathon final negotiating session, at the longest European Council ever, finished exactly one year ago today. The Treaty of Nice is the final outcome of the negotiations and provides the legal framework within which the EU is pursuing the enlargement negotiations. To put it bluntly, the Treaty of Nice is necessary for enlargement. If it does not enter into force, the accession process will be thrown into chaos and for it to enter into force it must be ratified by all 15 member states, including Ireland. For us not to ratify would indeed be, in the words of the motion before the House this evening, to impede or delay the accession of applicant states to the European Union. I am sure that there is no wish in this House, or more widely in the country, for this to happen. We have been assured by the great majority of those who have opposed the Treaty of Nice that they do not oppose enlargement. I do not doubt their sincerity but I do doubt their logic because the inevitable consequence of a failure to ratify Nice would be to impede and delay enlargement.</P>
    <P>There is simply no question that our partners are prepared to abandon the Nice treaty and proceed in some other way. Nice represents the results of a long and difficult year of negotiation. There are numerous careful and delicate balances within it and, being aware as I am of the firmness of the positions held round the table, there is no <Col N="526" /> reason to believe that any different outcome either was or would be available. At the General Affairs Council on 11 June, just after our referendum, Ministers, while expressing their readiness to help Ireland find a way forward, excluded any reopening of the text signed in Nice. They said that the ratification process will continue on the basis of this text and in accordance with the agreed timetable. This was confirmed by the European Council at Gothenburg.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in which we now find ourselves. On the one hand, there is the Nice treaty which is necessary for enlargement and to which the European Union as a whole is committed. I should add that the applicant countries themselves strongly support the ratification of Nice on schedule. On the other hand, there is the fact that the referendum enabling Ireland to ratify the treaty was defeated.</P>
    <P>This places not just the Government but Ireland as a whole in an unprecedentedly difficult position. In such a situation, the wisest course has to be to take the time to reflect carefully on the situation, to assess its causes and its meaning and to work out calmly and methodically how to move ahead. That is precisely what the Government has been doing. In so doing, we have been criticised on both sides.</P>
    <P>Many of those who oppose Nice have accused the Government of failing to represent the views and interests of the Irish people. They say that we have been apologising for the referendum result. That is false. We have said that, as the Government which negotiated Nice and being committed to the European Union and to enlargement, we regret the result &ndash; as we do, but we have apologised to nobody. The sovereign right of the Irish people to exercise their own choice has never been questioned either by the Government or by our partners &ndash; as Prime Minister Verhofstadt said again last week. Some of our critics argue that, immediately after the referendum, we should simply have gone to our partners and told them, and by extension the applicant countries, to forget about Nice, that it was dead. What they think would have happened then is not clear. Some suggest that our partners would have simply accepted that no treaty changes were possible and that enlargement could proceed regardless. Others say that it should have been possible to negotiate some radically different treaty &ndash; even if they omit to explain how they would persuade other member states to do so or what dramatically new elements could have been agreed.</P>
    <P>Frankly, this line of argument is quite unrealistic. It holds out prospects which are simply illusory and without any foundation. It would have us dictate to the other 14 member states what they should seek to do. Just as others did not seek to dictate to us, we are not in any position to ask other member states to stop their pro<Col N="527" /> cedures for the national ratification of a treaty which they negotiated, agreed to and support. Just as I do not apologise for what the Irish people said, neither do I apologise to anyone for seeking to pursue our national interest in remaining at the heart of the European Union and in enlargement. For us to block enlargement through a failure to ratify Nice would have potentially catastrophic consequences for our situation within the Union.</P>
    <P>However, while our partners have ruled out any changes to the text of the treaty as negotiated &ndash; just as happened after Denmark initially rejected the Treaty of Maastricht and indeed when General de Gaulle himself tried to change the Treaty of Rome in the 1960s &ndash; they have indicated their willingness to assist us in whatever way possible. It may be that there are aspects of the Treaty of Nice, or of the development of the Union generally, on which reassurances could be useful. This possibility is one which the Government is bearing in mind, including as we monitor the debate in the National Forum on Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Just as we could not have simply turned to our partners after 7 June and instructed them to throw the Treaty of Nice in the rubbish bin, it would equally have been wrong and counterproductive &ndash; and ultimately, in practical terms, impossible &ndash; for us to have proceeded as if nothing significant had happened. For the truth is that what happened was a surprise and a shock &ndash; to the Government, to others on the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side, and indeed, I believe, to some on the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side. It was certainly a grave disappointment to the other member states and to the applicant countries, so many of which looked to Ireland as a role model for small country success in the European Union. For many, it was this last aspect which was most extraordinary. Ireland is recognised throughout Europe as having made outstanding use of the opportunities offered to us by EU membership. In surveys, our people are consistently among the most positive in their assessment of the benefits of membership. These surveys also suggest a strong level of support for enlargement. For many, it was as if Europe's poster child had become the prodigal son.</P>
    <P>In that situation, it was and remains essential to analyse what happened, to explore its immediate and deeper causes and to consider how to address the concerns which have been identified. It is more important to do things right than to do them quickly, bearing in mind that the deadline for ratification of Nice is the end of next year.</P>
    <P>In the immediate aftermath of the vote, one thing upon which all commentators agreed was that there were multiple reasons for the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote, and in many cases had little or nothing to do with enlargement or the Treaty of Nice itself. Another critical factor was, of course, the disap<Col N="528" /> pointingly poor turnout. These initial impressions were broadly confirmed by the European Commission survey which appeared at the end of October. It revealed alarmingly high levels of public apathy and confusion about the treaty and about the European Union generally, which underlay both the abstention rate and the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote. While this factor was statistically the most significant, specific fears were expressed about issues such as the alleged loss of national sovereignty, perceived threats to our policy of military neutrality and the power of large member states as against small. It was also apparent from the survey, as from the referendum itself, that most people had found the campaign lacklustre, uninspiring and uninformative. I am by the way amused, but not surprised, that Patricia McKenna, MEP, is so strongly opposed to any attempts to amend the legislation governing the Referendum Commission so as to improve the quality of debate and to enable the public to be better informed.</P>
    <P>Given that such a range of issues contributed to the outcome of the referendum, what is needed in response is a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach which takes the time needed to work through the problems. The Government has adopted such an approach. The Nice treaty is, in itself, comparatively modest and insignificant in its content, though its purpose, enlargement, is deeply important. It has triggered a debate on the far wider question of Ireland in Europe. That is a debate which the Government is happy to have, and one we are confident which we, and others who are committed to Ireland's playing its full part in the Union, can and will win.</P>
    <P>Even before the referendum, it had become clear that, just as the European Union itself is changing, so is Ireland's place within it. The Union itself has successively, over a series of treaties, broadened out the scope of its activities and concerns from the original socio-economic core. Ireland has gone from being one of the poorest and least developed members of the Union to one of the wealthiest and most economically dynamic. In any circumstances, this would make it necessary to reflect on our priorities and objectives within the Union. The Government had intended, even before the referendum, to establish a forum for this purpose. We saw that this would dovetail well with the broader future of Europe debate which is taking place within the Union, the next stage of which will be launched at the Laeken European Council this weekend.</P>
    <P>I am happy to commend the forum for its work to date and to pay tribute to its participants and the skill, wisdom and dedication of its chairman, Senator Maurice Hayes, and its secretariat. I believe the forum is succeeding in its objective of fostering a broadly based and inclusive debate on the place of Ireland in an enlarging Union. The <Col N="529" /> focus of the initial phase of its work has been on enlargement and in the short space of time it has been meeting, it has explored the issues with considerable thoroughness. The forum has heard from a number of candidate country representatives, and from experts on sectoral aspects such as agriculture, trade and investment, the environment and social policy. It has heard from those who support enlargement and the Union and from those who oppose both. Its structure has allowed parties and groupings represented in the Oireachtas to have their say and has also involved, through the special observer pillar, the social partners and other groups with a particular interest in EU matters. In the new year it will be travelling widely throughout the country building on last week's session in Cork.</P>
    <P>Within the forum, and I understand the elements of this may usefully be drawn out, there has indeed been, as the Government would have hoped, a substantial consensus on the importance and desirability of enlargement. It would be valuable to have that message clearly underlined, in particular outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>My one regret is that media coverage of the forum has so far not been equal to the importance of the issues it is addressing and the substance of the contribution it is making. I know, as do all of us in this House, that the dumbing down of the coverage of politics and public affairs is a wider problem, but I find it irritating that very often those who lecture us on the inadequacy of political debate themselves constitute a large part of the problem by failing to report on substantive discussion when it does take place.</P>
    <P>That said, the value of the process so far has been two-fold. First, as indicated earlier, it has, in a systematic way, underscored the importance of enlargement and its potential benefits for Ireland while placing the challenges and potential risks in their proper context. I said to them at the time that this was not so, that the Government wanted open debate, that we were prepared, even at our own disadvantage, to skew the structure and procedures of the forum towards smaller groups and parties and that we were not interested in trying to establish an artificial consensus where none was possible. I said we would appoint a chairman who would be scrupulously fair.</P>
    <P>Our good faith and sincerity have now been clearly demonstrated by how the forum has evolved and I hope that this will be acknowledged. At times I have heard it suggested that we have gone too far to appease the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side and that we have given it a privileged and undeserved platform from which to sustain its attack on the Union. My response to that is two-fold. First, whether we like it or not, more than half of those who voted in the referendum, albeit in a low turn-out, voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It may well be that many of them do not necessarily share the views of those most active <Col N="530" /> on the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side, whose direct mandates tend to be very limited. However, there is no point in pretending that the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote did not happen or that it does not highlight real issues.</P>
    <P>Second, there is a real debate under way and the way to win it is to take part in it actively and constructively, to make one's arguments as cogently as possible, and to refute those of one's opponents. That is what my colleagues and I are trying to do with others in the forum. We are arguing that enlargement is good for Ireland and for Europe and that committed membership of the EU will continue to be firmly in Ireland's economic and social interests into the future, just as everyone knows it has been so far. We are arguing that pooling sovereignty within the Union enhances Ireland's influence over the turbulent external environment in which it must operate and that we need European co-operation against crime through measures such as the European arrest warrant, which is to be debated in this House tomorrow. We are also arguing that small states have much more say within the EU than they would outside it, and that their role is protected by the treaties.</P>
    <P>We are also addressing our opponents' untruths and exaggerations about the Treaty of Nice and about the Union. We are showing that the changes to be made by the Nice treaty are of a modest character and do not alter the fact that our relative position in the institutions will continue to be greatly in advance of what our population size alone would suggest. We are pointing out the facts about the Union's developing crisis management and humanitarian capacities and exploding the myths about a European army.</P>
    <P>The EU is continuing to develop, with Ireland's support, its common foreign and security policy as a means of playing a greater role for peace, stability and security in Europe and in the wider world. A core element of this work is the framing of a security and defence policy to equip the Union to undertake humanitarian aid, conflict prevention and crisis management tasks as provided for in the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. Against this background, Ireland is fully committed to the European security and defence policy and is playing an active role in the development of both its civilian and military aspects. In doing so, Ireland has the opportunity to play a constructive role in promoting peace and stability. If we have learnt anything from the horrific events of 11 September, it is the critical importance of co-operating to enhance the prospects for peace.</P>
    <P>Our participation in European security and defence policy is in the full knowledge that it is consistent with Ireland's excellent record in UN peacekeeping. It is also fully in keeping with our foreign policy principles and objectives and takes account of the changing and more complex nature of peacekeeping. Involvement does not entail <Col N="531" /> any mutual defence commitment and does not affect our position as a non-member of a military alliance. We are satisfied with developments in the security and defence area during the Belgian Presidency. The progress made, in both the civilian and military spheres, will be outlined in the presidency's report to the Laeken European Council.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that Fine Gael shares this positive approach to Europe. The party needs to think again about its refusal to take its seats in the forum. While it will calculate where its own political interest lies, it is strange to see Fine Gael adopting an abstentionist posture. It would be in the broader national interest for the party to bring its views and opinions on these issues to the pro-European side in the forum. Fine Gael's perspective would strengthen the hands of all of us who wish to see the Nice treaty ratified and Ireland's position in Europe copperfastened. A place at the forum will be kept open for Fine Gael indefinitely, as it moves on from focusing on enlargement to debating wider Future of Europe issues.</P>
    <P>Some of those who query the role of the forum place it in false opposition to the Oireachtas. That is unjustified. We need not limit or confine debate but should encourage it by every possible means. Debate in the forum complements and underpins that in the Dáil but does not replace it, as the debate on this motion demonstrates.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious that one of the most telling arguments in the Nice campaign &ndash; even if it had nothing to do with the treaty itself &ndash; was the allegation that the inadequacy of the role of the Oireachtas in scrutinising European business contributed to a substantial democratic deficit. We can all agree in this House and in the Seanad that Oireachtas scrutiny has not been as systematic or intense as it should have been, despite the good work of the Joint Committees on European Affairs and Foreign Affairs. In responding to the Labour Party's European Union Bill last June, I promised the Government would bring forward its own proposals in this area. Work has been continuing in my Department and at interdepartmental level since then, including a careful examination of practice in other member states. Simultaneously, the Whips' committee has been looking at proposals for reform of Oireachtas procedures and Standing Orders generally. I hope the Government will, early in the new year, be in a position to present a package of measures relating to the handling of EU business which will place Ireland among the Union's most advanced member states in this regard, while taking account of how negotiations in Brussels proceed.</P>
    <P>The lesson I would draw from experience elsewhere is that a culture of dialogue and consultation between the Executive and the Legislature <Col N="532" /> is as important as formal structures and procedures. This requires the investment of political will, energy and resources on both sides. The role of national Parliaments in the architecture of the Union is one of the subjects identified for further consideration in the future of Europe debate. This week's European Council will establish a convention to explore the options in relation to this and many other issues in advance of the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Future of Europe process is an entirely separate exercise from the Treaty of Nice. In an ideal world we would not need to deal with both questions at the same time. The purpose of the Nice treaty is to make the minimum changes necessary for enlargement, while the Future of Europe debate is a broader one. As it happens, many of the issues which arose during the referendum campaign have much more to do with it than with the Nice treaty. To ratify the Nice treaty would not be to prejudge the outcome of the Future of Europe process. Its basic purpose is to address the sense of disconnection between Europe and the people by making the Union more transparent, intelligible, democratic, and closer to the people.</P>
    <P>Second, while some sensationalist headlines might be generated from time to time, the reality is that nobody is contesting the fundamental primacy of the nation state as the basic building block of the European Union, now and into the future. What is involved is the possible improvement and development of existing arrangements, not the creation of some kind of federal super state. Third, having said that, we in Ireland should have the confidence to play an active and positive role in the convention and the eventual Intergovernmental Conference. The objectives of this exercise &ndash; such as the simplification of the treaties or greater clarity about who is responsible for what within the Union &ndash; may in practice not be easily achieved but they are in our interests and in the interests of all who care about the Union and popular support for it. The future of Europe debate has the potential to address many of the concerns which arose during the Nice treaty referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my and the Government's appreciation for this motion. It is imperative that the steps necessary to allow enlargement continue be taken, whether in Brussels, in the member states or in the candidate countries. We in Ireland have a specific role to play. The Government is acutely conscious of the obligations upon us but the sensitivity, complexity and importance of the issues involved require us to be measured, careful and comprehensive in our response. I urge all those who support Ireland's full engagement in Europe to play their part, with us, in doing what is needed to make enlargement possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to intrude into Deputy Quinn's time. He might change his generous offer had he read an article I have written about him which will appear in tomorrow's <i>Evening Herald.</i> However, I thank the Deputy for his offer and will take his four minutes in the generous spirit in which it is offered.</P>
      <P>I praise all the Members of the House who over the years, at both backbench and ministerial level, have tried to encourage a level of awareness about Europe that is not shared among the wider public. It is a tragedy that as the country becomes more prosperous and content we appear to become increasingly ignorant about public affairs and wider issues, such as Europe and global development. However, it is wrong for the politicians to accuse the public of ignorance on subjects because it assumes a degree of arrogance on our part. Many years ago I had the wonderful task of trying to sell the idea of Europe in the UK. I was involved in promoting for the European Commission's speakers' panel in London the idea of Lord Colefield's campaign for 300 new directives to integrate and complete the Single Market. It was not an easy job and the levels of ignorance in the UK were far higher than I have experienced here, although in view of the referendum vote on the Nice treaty we are catching up fast.</P>
      <P>There appears to be enormous public confusion about the Nice treaty referendum campaign, which was not assisted by the McKenna judgment. It effectively prevents the democratically elected and mandated Members of this House from projecting themselves on a national level in terms of party size. The recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution are sensible in that it proposes that at least half of campaign funding should be allocated in proportion to the size of parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As parliamentarians we must take the initiative and not merely complain about ignorance among the public. However, as other speakers in this debate have pointed out, it is prevalent among the public and in other member states. In a sense, political and administrative elites have dominated Europe for much too long and the people have been left behind in the debate on the development of Europe. The irony in Ireland is that the people voted against what was, essentially, a harmless compromise that had been arrived at in Nice. It was interesting to note that the great European, Jacques Delors, was rather scathing about the French Government's role in relation to the emergence of the compromise in Nice and <Col N="534" /> his remarks should be noted. It was, indeed, a compromise but it involves the practical integration of the candidate countries in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>I spent some time working in central and eastern Europe, setting up a radio station in Prague and working in Poland. Those people aspire to the lifestyle that we now happily enjoy. It seems tragic that the Irish people are turning their backs on those people. During a recent all-party visit to Slovakia, led by you, a Cheann Comhairle, I was forcibly struck by the fact that serious politicians in those countries, particularly Slovakia, were grossly disappointed by the result of our referendum. There is no point in pretending to the public that they were not disappointed and they felt we were turning our backs on them. They had almost modelled themselves on our success. They saw Ireland as the ideal model of a candidate country for EU membership, having joined in 1973 and, by some almost magical process, as it were, 30 years later our country had been transformed and modernised and had become very wealthy indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn may have some points to make about how we distribute that wealth and I would probably share his concerns, but the fact remains that we have become an enormously wealthy country because of our access to markets. As Mr. Peter Sutherland recently pointed out, it is the access to markets that has sold Europe both to Germany and ourselves. At one point in recent years, we were exporting more <i>per capita</i> and had a higher GNP per head than Japan at its height as a trading nation. That underlines our dependence on trade and, I hope, our dependence in future on these emerging new countries in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, after the Forum for Europe has met and gathered its thoughts &ndash; though I am in two minds as to the relevance of that particular forum &ndash; I would like that debate to return to this House through its elected committees. We need to democratise the European Commission. Some of the commentaries, including, surprisingly, from Commissioner David Byrne, are extraordinarily arrogant in relation to the failure of politicians to sell this referendum. That is unfair not just to the Government but to the political class at large. That is why I say we need to democratise the European Commission. Clearly, when some people arrive in Brussels, they become European as distinct from their ethnic origins. That is a bad sign, indicating that they are slipping away from reality at home, and we all know the consequences of that. If we lose touch with our electorate, it ends in defeat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to this debate and I hope we will have more debate in this House and elsewhere. I commend the speakers for their contributions so far. In summary, the <Col N="535" /> case for enlargement is a moral one first and foremost, an economic one, a democratic one, a strategic one and a global one because a strong, united and integrated European Union is of critical importance for the rest of the world, particularly the world that is rapidly experiencing the process of globalisation. From Ireland's point of view, it is my belief &ndash; this was reinforced very much in some of the submissions made at the Forum on Europe, to which some speakers referred &ndash; that it is in Ireland's national, geopolitical and economic interests that enlargement goes ahead and that we are central to it.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on record what is involved in enlargement, to look beyond the current list of candidate applicant states and try to get some sense of what might be the final shape of Europe. Recent discussions on Europe convey an impression that people have not got a sense of what might be the final territorial configuration of Europe. The ten central and eastern European states would bring the border of a future European Union up to the frontiers of Moldovia and the Ukraine and not beyond that point. I do not believe anybody contemplates a European Union going beyond that eastern boundary. There are other countries to the south-east of Europe which, in time, will I hope achieve a level of both political and democratic stability that will enable them to participate fully and to be fully integrated into Europe. I refer to the republics of former Yugoslavia. There are also two countries which, for their own reasons, have chosen not to participate &ndash; Norway and Iceland.</P>
      <P>Taken with the existing 13 prospective member countries, including Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Malta and Cyprus, there is a possibility of about 35 member states. Therefore, any constitutional configuration we want to put in place has to have regard to a confederation, or a federation or post-federal combination. There is no constitutional or legal word to describe the type of entity we are putting in place. The one that seems to gain most acceptance currently is a federation of nation states. However, I agree with the Minister and others that we are not in the process of constructing a federal super-state Europe. That is not on the agenda and I do not believe it would be acceptable to the vast majority of European citizens. I accept, as the Minister has said, that the building block for the foreseeable future will remain the nation state, whether it is a large centralised state like France, a federal state like Germany or a small nation state like Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should understand what we are asking the applicant countries to do in terms of enlargement. First, we are asking them to take on, simultaneously, three sets of transitions. We expect them to move, in the space of 14 years, from a command economy to a market economy and to accept an <i>acqui communitaire</i> which is much <Col N="536" /> more rigorous and onerous than anything we had to accept back in 1973. Both external global competition and the rigours of the European Union's internal market are now much more demanding, invasive and intrusive into areas of national economic activity than was the case in Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s. In itself, that is a very difficult transition for any country to make.</P>
    <P>Second, we are asking them to move from a one-party state to a pluralist democracy &ndash; I am not just referring to the advent of communism after 1945 or 1948 in the case of Hungary or Czechoslovakia. Most of those countries collapsed into dictatorships very soon after the Versailles treaty and into the rigours of depression and the immature political entities that they were in the 1920s. They were not the only countries to have that experience. Countries in western Europe disintegrated into fascism and the failure of democracy, as in Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Greece. Indeed, democracy was a very small island in Europe between the 1920s and the 1940s. Therefore, we are asking those who have no tradition of a pluralist democracy to move from their tradition of a one-party state or dictatorship into a pluralist democracy.</P>
    <P>The third transition we are asking them to make &ndash; this is critical for a market economy &ndash; is to move from the nomenclature of an integrated and compromised administration that is not seen as being independent from the rule of Parliament or Government, or indeed independent in relation to the operation of the market itself, to where the Civil Service, as in this country, is seen to be impartial. We should be much more sensitive to the difficulties associated with that transition because we have had, within the living institutional memory of people in this House and our grandparents, the necessity for the establishment of the Civil Service Commission, the necessity for the cultural acceptance that canvassing will disqualify and the realisation that we had a very corrupt local administration system that necessitated the establishment of the county managerial system. None of us, hand on heart, would say that we now have the model perfectly correct. It is like a garden, one has to return frequently to aspects of it, improve it and get it right, hence our need for freedom of information legislation or scrutiny in respect of various aspects. Every one of them is poorer in absolute terms than Ireland was when it joined the EEC. We are asking them to undertake an extremely difficult process, but they have made extraordinarily good progress to date.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of sessions of the Forum on Europe have taken place at Dublin Castle. I recommend to Members the newsletter published by the Institute of European Affairs, to which I now wish to refer. The newsletter states that a number of spokespersons from different candidate countries offered their reasons for wanting <Col N="537" /> to join the European Union, first among which is the fact that they want to consolidate their recently won or restored democratic systems. The spokespersons point, properly and correctly, to the experience of Greece, Spain and Portugal. Nobody in their right mind would believe that Greece, for example, would return to the anarchy of the dictatorship which held sway in that country as recently as 1974. No one could ever have dreamed that in less than 21 days the Greek drachma and the German deutschmark will be merged into the single currency of the euro.</P>
    <P>The newsletter goes on to state that the countries in question also want to become a law-based community of states which believe in peaceful relations with their neighbours &ndash; in contrast, they refer to the fact that many of them share a troubled past with the Balkan states; that they are greatly encouraged by the clear political determination on the part of the member states to proceed with enlargement; that they refer, inevitably, to particular problems in public administration in their legal systems; that they acknowledge the help they have received for many years from the Commission and member states, including Ireland; and that they point to the great advances they have made in economic development, in parliamentary, administrative and legal reform and in civil society &ndash; advances acknowledged by the Union, most recently in the Commission's report of 13 November which suggests that ten candidates may be ready for entry this time next year.</P>
    <P>In the report to which I refer the Commission points out that of the 31 chapters that comprise the body of negotiations relating to the countries in question, with their weak historical systems, Cyprus has completed 23 chapters, the Czech Republic, 21; Slovakia, 20; Hungary, 22, and Slovenia 29. The two weaker countries excluded from the negotiation process, Bulgaria and Romania, have completed 12 and eight chapters, respectively. These countries have made extraordinary progress in the face of great difficulties at a time when, in many cases, their populations have found it hard to accept the rigours of competition, austerity and correction. They have been confronted with a decision made by the people in this country which seemed to slam the door upon them. I share the view expressed by Deputy Conor Lenihan that, notwithstanding their polite statements to the effect that they respect the decision of the Irish people, politicians from various countries cannot understand the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty and, in some respects, they take it personally.</P>
    <P>We have not properly conveyed to the Irish people the real benefits of pooling and sharing sovereignty. Ireland has achieved far more as a national entity &ndash; politically, economically and culturally &ndash; since it began pooling and sharing its sovereignty. That is a reality which those <Col N="538" /> opposed to enlargement and the European project failed to engage with and recognise. As the Minister and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated, we must confront the inward isolationist assertion that an exclusive and excessive focus on sovereignty is in Ireland's best interests. Our experience since independence in 1922 shows that the more we have shared sovereignty, the more enterprising and wealthy &ndash; how that wealth is distributed is a secondary issue &ndash; we have become. If we contrast our pooled sovereignty &ndash; in economic and political terms &ndash; with the isolationist &ldquo;sinn féin&rdquo; economics of the 1930s, there is no comparison in terms of which model is the more successful from Ireland's point of view. Successive results in elections and the progress made by various Administrations are a testament to this.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the comments of my constituency colleague, Deputy Gormley, in relation to intergovernmentalism and the role of the Commission. This is not the first occasion on which I have heard the Deputy speak on this issue and I get the sense that his party has a complete lack of understanding of the unique political and institutional role of the Commission within the European Union and the fact that its strengthening as an institution &ndash; or set of institutions &ndash; is absolutely critical for the survival and enhancement of the autonomy of small member states within an enlarged Union. If there is any deficit in the political discourse among those of us who share a common commitment to the European project, it is that we have not yet fully or properly conveyed to the Irish electorate &ndash; whether through articles in the <i>Evening Herald</i> or elsewhere &ndash; the nature of the role of the Commission.</P>
    <P>We have allowed the lie to be placed frequently on to the record in successive debates that the unelected, unaccountable, bureaucratic Commission in Brussels imposes legislation upon the Irish people. That is simply not true. On occasion, Ministers and officials, for whatever reason, have blamed Brussels when, as everyone knows, it is the Council of Ministers which makes political decisions on foot of initiatives and proposals emanating from the Commission. It is that particular triangular set of institutions, with the Commission at its core, which is the unique creative and innovative component of the European project. It is at the very centre of the success of the European Union, which has replaced 500 years of conflict, civil war, devastation and economic disaster brought about by a certain form of intergovernmentalism. I have stated on many occasions that the most elegant monument to European intergovernmentalism is the Arc de Triomphe in the centre of Paris on which are listed the battles entered into by one large country against other European states in an attempt <Col N="539" /> to enforce one form of intergovernmentalism on them.</P>
    <P>It was, therefore, the movement of the European Union and its peoples away from that historical legacy which brought into existence the Commission as an institution. We have not adequately conveyed to our people the importance of the Commission and the fact that sharing and pooling sovereignty are in Ireland's best interests because they will achieve the best possible outcome for them.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's outlining of where we must go between now and the end of next year. There is no doubt that it will be a difficult journey. We must confront those who see no contradiction between being in favour of enlargement, on the one hand, and not recognising that we must engage with the Nice treaty, on the other. That will not be easy. The Forum on Europe was not originally proposed by the Labour Party as a vehicle to achieve a debate on Europe prior to the ratification of the Nice treaty, of which we were in favour. However, we believe it essential in terms of teasing out the options for the Irish people in terms of what will be the end destination of the European Union and what it will look like when complete. The original clause in the Treaty of Rome which refers to an ever closer Union is no longer, of itself, adequate and needs to be replaced with some form of picture which will show the people what we are asking them to buy into. This is what the debate on the European Union and its future is about.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by stating that our colleagues in Fine Gael could continue to make their constructive contribution to the debate on Europe by taking up the seats available to them in Dublin Castle at the Forum on Europe.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the first of two which I intend to bring before the House to implement the £850 million social welfare package announced in last week's budget. This is the second year running in which the social welfare package amounts to £850 million, and the first time in many years in which it has exceeded the income tax package.</P>
      <P>In the five years since this Government came into office, Ireland has changed dramatically for the better. This Fianna Fáil-led Government has delivered on its commitment to ensure social welfare recipients have benefited from economic growth. Over the lifetime of this Government pensioners on contributory old age pensions received increases of almost 50% compared to a miserly 10% under the rainbow Government. Pensioners on non-contributory pensions got increases of no less than 56% compared to 11% under the rainbow coalition Government. Child benefit has increased by more than £60 per month per child for the first two children compared to only £10 under the rainbow coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in Government has massively increased spending on social welfare from £4.5 billion in 1997 to more than £7.4 billion in 2002, an increase of almost two thirds in just five years and over 20% on 2001.</P>
      <P>The recent budget has been welcomed by a wide range of groups. The Combat Poverty Agency commended the policy direction of increasing welfare payments in line with earnings. People with Disabilities in Ireland, the representative body of people with a disability, welcomed the improvements for people with disability. In the past few days none other than the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Noonan, said that one of the good things about the budget was the significant resources in social payments. However, Deputy Noonan believes the individual detail of the budget is not the issue. That is where we in Fianna Fáil differ from Fine Gael. We know that the detail of how individuals benefit is what really counts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say nothing. In line with the commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, all old age pensions have been increased by more than the rate of earnings growth over the period. When we came into office, the contributory old age pension stood at only 28% of average industrial earnings. We have increased that in each year to 31% in 2002, well on the way towards the target set by the national pensions policy initiative of 34%.</P>
      <P>This Bill addresses commitments set out in the Government Action Programme aimed at building an inclusive society, improves the living standards of everyone on social welfare and fulfils our commitments under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. With increases ranging from 9% to 11.8%, people dependent on social welfare will see real and significant increases in their incomes next year.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the key provisions of the Bill. Over our period in Government we have given pensioners weekly increases of £5, £6, £7, and £10 in both 2001 and 2002 compared to increases of between £1.50 and £3 given by the rainbow coalition Government. The increases provided for in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill more than deliver on our commitments.</P>
      <P>Last year I gave a commitment to increase widow's and widower's contributory pension for those over 66 to the full old age contributory pension rate. The special increase provided for in section 2 of the Bill of £12.04 will bring the new rate to £114.04, within £2 of the full old age contributory rate.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed to substantial increases in other social welfare payments. Over the period from 1997, general social welfare increases have increased well ahead of inflation and ahead of increases in gross average industrial earnings.</P>
      <P>In this budget, despite the difficult times caused by the world economic downturn and the resulting pressure on resources, we are giving very significant increases to those who are least well off. The increases being provided this year for people on the lowest payments are greater than last year and are being paid much earlier. We are providing a general increase of £8 per week in respect of social welfare customers under pension or retirement age. In percentage terms, the £8 increase is between 7.4% and 9.4%, depending on the payment concerned. In addition we are providing a special increase of £9.56 for those on the lowest rates of social welfare supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance. This brings the lowest social welfare rate up to £93.60. This increase of £9.56 is in line with the majority recommendation of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group, which was established under the PPF and reported last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> There is considerable merit in raising all payments, as and when this is possible, with the objective of ensuring a reasonable relationship in due course between the average living standards in the community and the level of social welfare payments. Not only have we made substantial progress towards the PPF target of £100 for the lowest social welfare payments, we have almost reached this target this year. I have no doubt that the target will be exceeded in the remaining budget in the period of the programme. This Bill is fully in keeping with our commitments under the PPF.</P>
    <P>We are also providing further very significant increases of £10 per week for qualified adults aged 66 and over with lesser amounts for those on reduced payments. A pensioner couple on a full social welfare payment will therefore get an increase of £20 per week. The qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 has been increased from 72% of the old age contributory pension in 1997 to 77% in 2002 and now represents 85% of the old age non-contributory pension. As I promised last year, this will be increased in the coming years to the full old age non-contributory pension rate to benefit women in the home who do not qualify for the contributory pension.</P>
    <P>There are also substantial increases for qualified adults under age 66. The qualified adult allowances are being increased by £8 and £9 per week so that, for example, a couple on the lowest rate of payment, supplementary welfare allowance, will get a total increase of £17.50, bringing their weekly payment up to £155.60 and, if they have children, they will also benefit from the substantial increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>It has been a source of some complaint in the past that social welfare increases used to come into effect later than budget tax changes. We were berated that increases were announced in December and not delivered until much later &ndash; the second week in June when we came to office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We made dramatic changes in that regard; the Deputy should not start me talking about that. It was also a source of complaint that tax changes were implemented much earlier than social welfare increases. Last year I brought forward the implementation date of social welfare weekly rate increases to the start of the tax year, that is, 6 April. Now that the tax year has moved to the start of January, I am bringing forward the budget increases in weekly rates of payment to 1 January, at a cost to the Exchequer and a benefit to social welfare recipients of approximately £80 million. This means that in 2002 social welfare clients will be paid their increase for the full 52 weeks of the year compared to 29 weeks when we came into office in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> In the case of an old age contributory pensioner, this is equivalent to an extra 4.4% annual increase in their earnings, apart from the actual increase. People receiving short-term payments such as unemployment payments will receive their increases immediately in the first week in January. In the case of people on long-term payments, such as pensions, because of the time needed to print and distribute pension books, pensioners will receive their increases somewhat later.</P>
    <P>Some 210,000 people, mainly widows and widowers, one parent families, invalidity pensioners and persons receiving carer's allowance, will receive a lump sum payment for six weeks of the budget increases on 14 February. This will be included in their new order books effective from that date. For example, a widow on a contributory pension over 66 years of age will receive a backdated payment of £72.24, nearly 92. A further 393,000 recipients, mainly old age and retirement pensioners and disability allowance recipients, who are due to get their new order books in April, will receive a special payment in mid-February comprising six weeks arrears of the budget increase and seven weeks advance payment. For example, a pensioner couple over age 66 will receive a lump sum payment of £260 or 330 on 15 February.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill increases the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement from January next by amounts ranging from 34.22 to 35.09 or £26.95 to £27.64 for all families on FIS. This will lead to a net gain of £16 per week in the average FIS family payment. These increased payments will be paid immediately in the first week in January next. Section 5 provides for an increase in the earnings ceiling for employees' social insurance PRSI contribution and the income ceiling for payment of optional contributions while section 6 provides for a reduction in the employers' higher rate of social insurance contribution by 1.25%. The earnings ceiling is being increased in line with projected increases in average earnings in 2002 &ndash; that is, 8% &ndash; by £2,260 from £28,250 to 38,740 with effect from the start of the income tax year in January next. The employers' higher rate of social insurance contribution is being reduced from 11.3% to 10.05% with effect from the beginning of March next at a cost of 237 million or £186.65 million in 2002 and 347 million or £273 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a once off transfer of 635 million or £500.10 million in the 2002 financial year from the social insurance fund to the central fund of the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure has provoked <Col N="545" /> some debate within the House over the past week. The social insurance fund was established 48 years ago, in 1953. For all but the last five of these years, contribution income to the fund was insufficient to meet demands on the fund. During the first 43 years of the fund's existence, the shortfall in income has been met from Exchequer funds, in other words, by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, income to the social insurance fund has exceeded spending. This remarkable turn around is a result of this Government's prudent management of the economy&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;with the result that the social insurance fund now enjoys an accumulated surplus of over £1 billion or 1.4 billion. In these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that a part of this surplus should be returned to the source from which earlier shortfalls were met. The value in real terms of transfers in the opposite direction since 1953 exceeds £11 billion or 14 billion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Penrose of the Labour Party wanted to raid the pension reserve fund. The Opposition parties have no credibility in <Col N="546" /> their criticism of this section. On Sunday, 2 December, the Labour Party proposed to take £815 million from the pension reserve fund for its pet projects. In fact, it threatened to raid the entire £5.5 billion which has been set aside for future pensions. Now it criticises the transfer of a much smaller amount.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has raised spurious arguments about our future plans for the social insurance fund. It has shown political immaturity by failing to interpret properly the Government's commitment to the prudent management of the fund. We have ensured that benefits are guaranteed into the future by establishing the national pensions reserve fund, despite objections from the Opposition benches. The Deputies tend to forget these things. Fine Gael is obviously disappointed that the Government did not return the country to borrowing. Fine Gael's inability to manage the economy is heavily underlined by its continued objection to the common sense principle of putting the social insurance fund surplus to productive use instead of borrowing. Does the Opposition want to go back to the days of a £1 increase in child benefit or a £1.50 increase for pensioners? If not, I challenge it to say publicly, without the palaver and blather, how it would have funded this year's social welfare budget package.</P>

Equally, it is appropriate that the taxpayer, who has contributed so much to the fund since its inception, should benefit in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>

Deputy Broughan, Deputy Brian Hayes, Deputy McGrath and other Deputies criticise us for overspending on the one hand and, on the other, say we are not giving enough.</P>

      <P>When Apollo 13 was in trouble in space, they were in contact with Cape Canaveral over the antenna. From Apollo 13 they said, &ldquo;Houston, we have a problem.&rdquo;  We certainly have a problem in relation to some of the sections in this Bill the Minister presents to the House this evening. Despite his incomprehensible remarks, this Government is raiding the social insurance fund. It is taking £500 million out of the fund when there was an explicit commitment in the 1997 Fianna Fáil party manifesto that that fund would be secured, and that a board would be established to ensure greater accountability and transparency. Various employers, unions, and third pillar representatives were to be part of that board to ensure accountability. In an astonishing statement, the manifesto also said &ndash; the Minister himself might have said it &ndash; that the Government would create a new board to supervise the financing and operation of the social insurance fund.</P>
      <P>I should have said at the outset that I would like to share my time with Deputy McGrath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">

      <P>The manifesto then went on to say that that fund was the workers' guarantee that their benefits would be there for them when needed, without interference or means testing. It goes on to say that board members will include representatives of employers, employees, self-employed people, retired people and other interest groups. I was astonished to read in the manifesto the claim that there would be an actuarial assessment of the fund. Its future needs were to be placed before Dáil Éireann at least every three years. &ldquo;Houston, we have a problem&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Five years ago, they said that there was absolutely no difficulty. The social insurance fund was safe in their hands. They said this fund would be administered by a new board. Yet, four and a half years later, they are prepared to raid money that is not theirs. This is not the Minister's money. It belongs to Irish workers. It belongs to employers PRSI. Many constituents of mine have asked what benefits they get from PRSI. I try to show them that there are tangible benefits in difficult times. I refer to the comments made recently by Mr. Begg of ICTU when he said the trade union pillar wants to have enhanced payments for redundancies. Deputy Broughan and I are on record, as is the Minister at certain times, as supporting the principle of paid parental leave. We want to ensure that Irish workers, who have paid considerable sums of money into this fund, get the benefits they deserve.</P>
      <P>What do we see here but a slick job from Fianna Fáil? It thought we would not be able to read the history books. It welched on its commitments once again. What a colossal U-turn this is. Last Friday, the Minister admitted that we may be in difficulty on the unemployment front. The difficulties that have to be confronted could well ensure that the social insurance fund is needed in difficult times over the next year. It is an act of financial irresponsibility.</P>
      <P>I have read the contributions of the distinguished former Member, Dr. Ryan, who introduced the 1952 Bill. Dr. Ryan clearly set out the reasons this fund was to be established. It is not like any other fund. It is not an ordinary current account fund. It is a current liabilities account because moneys that go into it are there for designated purposes. They are not there to get the Government through a difficult patch. They are workers' moneys and for specific purposes. The Minister has a neck to come to the House and attack the Labour Party for its proposal to take certain moneys out of the pension reserve fund.</P>
      <P>Where is the consistency from this Government? I will have much more to say about this. I understand the Minister will dodge a debate with me on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; tomorrow because he does not want to confront the U-turn in his policy.</P>

      <P>The situation proposed by the Government in this raid has not arisen before. We, on this side of the House, will have much more to say about it on Committee and Report Stages over the next number of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government came into office, it was given a unique opportunity to make a major difference to the lives of the people. The social and economic objectives of all previous Administrations were severely limited by financial constraints, but not those of this Government. It came to power during a very special period in the history of the State, a period we may never experience again. The Government was not constrained by financial resources. The only constraints on it were of its own making. These included a lack of political imagination and a lack of political skills in managing the big issues impacting on people's lives, such as issues relating to health poverty, income <Col N="552" /> poverty, housing poverty and the lack of public services for some of the poorest people.</P>
    <P>The biggest failure of all has been to understand the reality of poverty and the failure in terms of political will to tackle the deep social divisions and the profound inequalities that exist in our country. To deepen social divisions and to widen inequalities at a time of unprecedented prosperity is a national scandal. I have no doubt the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is the pin-up boy of the rich and well connected in this country. In every budget, he has consistently favoured the rich against the poor. In each of the past five budgets, he has widened the gap between the richest and the poorest sections of our country.</P>
    <P>The gap between the rich and the poor in our society is now so wide that they effectively live in parallel universes. His ideological approach to social and economic policy met with no restraint from his colleagues in Government. A closet Progressive Democrat, he totally abandoned traditional Fianna Fáil principles of social solidarity and used his period in office as a class warrior for the rich and well connected. His success in promoting the interests of a particular class was facilitated by the failure of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, to defend the interests of the weak and the poorest. At a time of plenty, during a period of unprecedented prosperity, the Government has allowed the gap between the richest and the poorest to grow deeper and wider.</P>

      <P>The divide between rich and poor is now deeper in Ireland than in any other country in the EU. That was admitted by the Minister during Question Time this afternoon when he gave us the latest information from the household survey. Is that not right, Deputy Broughan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Through its taxation and social welfare policies, the Government has consciously and deliberately deepened inequalities in society. Let me illustrate the nature of the growing divide with some basic facts and figures after five budgets. Single people who are long-term unemployed are £20 per week better off. Those on £15,000 per annum are £96 per week better off while those on £40,000 per annum are £206 per week better off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>After five budgets, couples who are long-term unemployed are £48 per week better off, couples with one income earning £15,000 per annum are £97 per week better off and those on £40,000 per annum are £206 per week better off. These income distributions reflect the choices <Col N="553" /> made by the Government during its five years in office. No amount of rhetoric or political assertion can change these facts. It is obvious that the Government's commitment to building a fairer and more inclusive society, as outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, was just window dressing designed to impress, as CORI has so rightly pointed out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>One major illustration of the Government's failure to give social inclusion the priority it demands can be seen in its treatment of the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Promised in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, this review has been ongoing for over a year. Seven working groups completed their studies several months ago, but the Government has still failed to publish the National Anti-Poverty Strategy review. Facts and figures may be used to bamboozle or deceive.</P>
      <P>As the Government staggers towards the exit door, what is the reality for tens of thousands of people living in poverty? A recent study by the Dublin Institute of Technology social science department of 50 welfare dependent mothers in a Dublin suburb found the following. Mothers in low income families are going without food to ensure their families have decent meals. The study found women make do with toast or bread and do without meat so that other family members do not go without. Watering down milk and skimping on medically prescribed diets were other ways of making limited income stretch further. That is the life lived by some people in the land of the Celtic tiger economy.</P>
      <P>A recent report from UCD highlights the reality of poverty among the elderly. According to that report, as many as 2,000 elderly people die prematurely each winter from cold related illnesses because of fuel poverty. Homelessness is also part of the reality of that life. The Simon Community estimates that there are up to 5,000 homeless persons in the State, many of whom are suffering from mental illness and for whom there are no services. More than 200 of the 800 people who used Simon's Dublin shelter last year had serious mental illness problems. They are on the streets because they have nowhere else to go. That there are hundreds of mentally ill people homeless in this country is an extraordinary indictment of this Government and its policies. They are among the most vulnerable of all and yet they are allowed to wander the streets uncared for and unwanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it came into office, the Government could have made different choices. It could have delivered a first rate health service but instead it has presided over growing waiting lists. It has <Col N="554" /> deepened inequalities by favouring access to health care for private patients over public patients. It could have established common waiting lists for public hospital patients. Access to quality health care is critical in any coherent anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>There are now 125,000 people on public housing waiting lists, but the Government is failing to meet its own very modest housing targets. In the national development plan, it promised 5,500 social housing units in each of the four years of the plan. In 2000, the first year of the plan, it delivered just 3,000, a shortfall of 2,500.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted selectively from my pre-budget submission, but I stand over everything I said in it. Despite all the politicking, there are good measures in this Bill. I proposed a total of 48 different measures and some of them were accepted. I proposed a £10 increase across the board. I am disappointed that the Minister has continued &ndash; I would have taken my hat off to him if he had done something &ndash; to make distinctions between various groups of people who obtain welfare assistance. It is wrong that we continue to have a view that there are deserving poor and undeserving poor.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about widows. Widows under 66 years of age will not get the increase about which he spoke. The day the Minister announced the increase for widows over 66 years, I congratulated him. If the Minister amends the Bill to extend the free schemes to all widows and widowers, I will change my objections to the Bill. I put that challenge to the Minister. That was part of my proposal but he did not mention it in his tirade this evening or last week. It is not just about income &ndash; this is where I disagree with some of the commentators from the various groups from which we hear. Poverty relates not only to income; it relates to household poverty, fuel poverty and health poverty. We have to be honest enough to state that. If the Minister had gone some of the way towards a proposal I made and which he did not quote about moving towards £100, which is in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I would have congratulated him.</P>

      <P>If the Minister had gone some way to change the CDAs, I would have complimented him on it. I do not think the issue is about rates &ndash; I have to be honest &ndash; but about a variety of schemes we can introduce through our social welfare system to lift the poorest group of people out of poverty. I still do not believe that by making distinctions in social welfare schemes we are going in the right direction. I would have been <Col N="555" /> much happier, for instance, if the Minister had decided to make a blanket increase across the board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact the Minister has moved in relation to those on unemployment assistance, but it is not enough. I understand a lot has to do with constraints, but I do not think those choices have been made wisely.</P>
      <P>Over two months ago, Deputy Broughan and I asked a direct question concerning the benchmarking and indexation group, namely, whether the Minister is in favour of it. Does he want to reach the minimum benchmark level by 2007? I ask him to give us an answer. We know Deputy McCreevy and the Tánaiste have not signed up to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot answer the questions I ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in my document that we should have made more progress with regard to the £100. I recognise that the Minister has taken on board the recommendation of the Combat Poverty Agency in relation to unemployment assistance with the addition of £1.50, but more should have been done. We have an unhealthy definition in our social welfare code saying that if one is unemployed one is somehow a loser and, consequently, will not receive the kind of resource we need in our system, with which I have a problem. We need to ensure that when we provide increases, <Col N="556" /> they apply across the board. I accept that this is difficult and it is something we can debate further on Committee Stage tomorrow. However, it is something that could have been achieved and I hope we will move towards it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increases from January, many of the deadline dates that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, are setting between now and May have nothing to do with backdating payments and everything to do with the next general election. It is cynical. It was more than possible to put an administrative system in place to deliver these small payments on 1 January. I will not put my name to a Bill which is effectively giving very small increases backdated to mid-February. It is not good enough. No other citizen&mdash;</P>

      <P>The first thing we must point out is the raiding of the social insurance fund. Many ordinary people on the street recognise that they were contributing to a social insurance fund and that it is now being raided by the Minister for short-term gains. I am interested in the term he used in his speech. He said that £500 million is being taken for &ldquo;productive use&rdquo;. What does he mean by &ldquo;productive use&rdquo;? I do not think one can call current spending &ldquo;productive use&rdquo;. He really means &ldquo;productive use&rdquo; in the sense that the Government will use the fund to buy victory in the election. That is the &ldquo;productive use&rdquo; of which the Minister speaks and it is a shame.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brian Hayes has already put on the record of the House the commitment given in the Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1997 relating to the social insurance fund, and it deserves a response from the Minister because&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important to point out some of the comments that were made in relation to this budget. I want to quote from the CORI justice commission report. The commission has issued its commentary on budget 2002. The report has a big heading across the front: &ldquo;Five in a Row: Prosperity without Fairness&rdquo;. It states:</P>
      <P>For the fifth year in a row this Government has failed to give priority to the deprivation being experienced by Ireland's poorest people. While the country has been experiencing the most prosperous period ever, the Government's budgetary choices have produced a situation where Ireland's poorest people are expected to live on £93.56 a week. Its choices have also widened the rich-poor gap by £191 a week. This is unjust, unfair and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>That is what CORI said about the recent budget and about the performance of this Government. The report continues:</P>
      <P>However, the most important requirement in tackling poverty is the provision of sufficient income to people to enable them to live life with dignity. This Government has failed dismally during its term in office to address this issue despite having the best opportunity to do so since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>That is a commentary on the front-page of the budget analysis by CORI. It is <Col N="558" /> fairly damning of this Government and what it has attempted to do.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on the advertising campaign that has been launched by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in the newspapers and on radio and television. I have never seen the like of it in my time in this House. I am here almost the same length of time as the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. We have seen, day after day, publications with full-page advertisements concerning the Minister, two photographs in each advertisement, all at the taxpayers' expense and all promoting him and this Government. If he wanted to disseminate information, there are other ways in which he should have gone about it. He went about it in a shameful way. It is interesting to note that he spent £130,000 in the national papers. If one is serious about disseminating information into people's homes, then advertising should be done through the local newspapers. Various reviews and surveys have indicated there is a far higher readership of local papers than of national papers.</P>

Can it be in the interests of common justice to classify children according to the category one puts their parents in? Is that fair or <Col N="559" /> just? For the past four years we have asked the Minister to do something about that and each year he has failed miserably. Why does the Minister not do something even at this stage, even if it is only to take away something we can talk about? The Minister has failed to do something, yet he is prepared to say he is interested in individuals and individual measures.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in family income supplement. It is a great way to get money to the less well off and those struggling to survive. However, is it not time to introduce natural justice here? One can have two families living next to each other, with three children and identical mortgages and outgoings, but if one breadwinner is self-employed and the other a PAYE worker, we can give FIS to the PAYE family while the person next door, who may be on exactly the same income according to the Revenue Commissioners, will not be paid FIS. Is that fair? Why will the Government not move to bring about justice for those people?</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, deploring:</P>
      <P>(1) the decision of the Government to raid more than 635 million from the Social Insurance Fund, and</P>
      <P>(2) the failure to make adequate progress towards the benchmarking of social welfare payments,</P>
      <P>declines to give a second reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2001, marks an historic development in the history of the State, dealing as it does with budget 2002 increases in euros from late December and early next January. The increases in social insurance and social assistance are welcome, as is the proposed increase in child benefit which will be included in the Social Welfare Bill, 2002. Yet this Bill must be strongly opposed by the Labour Party on three key grounds. For many recipients of social assistance and social insurance benefits the Bill is a bitter disappointment, since it fails to implement the report of the social welfare benchmarking body and lift social welfare incomes sufficiently to enable the targets of the benchmarking report to be reached from 2003 onwards. Second, the Bill is a total rejection of the long-standing and just demands of the carers of Ireland for an end to the grossly unfair means testing of the carer's allowance. The appalling proposal in section 7 to raid the social insurance fund to enable the Minister for Finance to balance his shaky, ill-conceived budget is an affront to workers and employers. If passed, it will create a woeful pre<Col N="560" /> cedent for future Governments to interfere with this and other dedicated national assets whenever a tight budgetary situation presents itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was anxious in his Budget Statement to be judged on the five budgets he has introduced, though like many commentators in the House I do not believe there will be any further chapters in his book. To continue his metaphor, these five chapters have been a tragic story of missed opportunities in the most prosperous times in the history of the nation. For hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens the McCreevy book has been a horror story, as they struggle on abysmally low social welfare incomes. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has been a willing acolyte of the harsh ideologue from north Kildare in all this suffering&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;who is now one of our longest serving Ministers for Finance.</P>
      <P>This came home strongly to many Members when we were presented with the fine report of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice named &ldquo;One Long Struggle&rdquo;. This study of low income families surveyed 163 households in Dublin and found that current social welfare rates and the minimum wage are grossly inadequate and do not reflect the current cost of even the most frugal standard of living.</P>
      <P>Regarding social welfare rates, the study concluded that there is an urgent need to increase them to a realistic level at which people can live with some dignity and without the burden of a continuous shortfall. The report showed a majority of respondents suffering considerable anxiety and depression as they tried to juggle their family responsibilities while coping with financial shortfalls from week to week. I recently quoted in the Dáil the deficient daily diet of low income families as disclosed by the Vincentian Partnership research.</P>
      <P>This study urges the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to apply a budget standards approach to the levels of social welfare payments required, which the Minister has never done, and it indicates that a typical lone parent with two children receives &ndash; admittedly before the budget &ndash; almost £40 less than what a low cost but acceptable budget would require.</P>
      <P>The recommended levels of income in &ldquo;One Long Struggle&rdquo;, by the way, are £135 to £155 for a single adult or 171 to 197, and £200 or 254 for a lone parent with one or two children. Yet the basic personal assistant rate in Schedule B of the Bill is still only 118.8 and a parent with two children can still only look forward to 157 from early January. In a very significant work of recent research the social welfare rates of the Government were found to be and continue to be hopelessly inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="561" /> The Government enjoyed unprecedented rates of double digit growth for almost its entire life yet for its first three years increases in social welfare income barely kept pace with inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;are misplaced as the rip-offs have already begun under the old currency. Deputies are constantly informed of relentless rises in the price of foodstuff, drink, services and insurance products in particular. Many of these prices affect the very people examined in the Vincentian Partnership study most deeply &ndash; Irish families on low incomes. Despite valiant efforts by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, the Tánaiste has refused to take any serious action on this problem beyond the mild admonition to the grocery multiples and licensed trade. The result is that prices which have risen dramatically this year will stay relatively stable in euros after Christmas but our social welfare recipients will bear the brunt of this aspect of the euro changeover. For this reason also the basic increases in rates detailed in sections 2 and 3 are once again disappointing. Last week the Minister was engaged in his usual rant about the era before the Celtic tiger, proudly detailing his welfare rises for 2002 of 7.4% to 9.4% as he did again tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> He did not tell the Dáil that he had, once again, missed one of the key targets of most of the pre-budget submissions he received. The Combat Poverty Agency, for example, urged the Minister to index social welfare payments in line with wage growth in the economy before he left office. This would mean an increase of 10.4% in weekly welfare, a basic rise of £14, or 17.80. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs hopelessly missed this target and has made the task of his successors in reaching the level of welfare income recommended by the benchmarking group more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency noted that the vast bulk of additional resources over indexation in the past three budgets was allocated to tax reductions, rather than to improvements in the income of the poorest sections of society. The agency concluded that the richest 30% received more than half of all resources, while the poorest 30% received less than 10%. It is for this reason that the agency believes that the Government's widening of income inequalities threatens to undermine the objectives of the national anti-poverty strategy. The first lengthy critique of the budget and the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2001, comes from the justice commission of CORI, in a submission called Five in a row: Prosperity Without Fairness.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and social welfare incomes is a devastating indictment of the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs. The submission says that &ldquo;as a direct result of the choices contained in Budget 2002, the number of people living in relative income poverty will continue to rise, the rich/poor gap will continue to widen, many people in low-paid jobs will gain nothing, families on very low incomes will not have a right to a medical card and large numbers of people will continue to wait for appropriate accommodation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>CORI pointed out that Ireland spends a lower proportion of GNP, 17.5%, on social inclusion than any other European Union country. The Irish provision is way below the European average of 28.2% of GNP. CORI continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more people living in relative income poverty, with less than £109 per week per adult equivalent, today than there were ten years ago. While the depth of some people's poverty has been reduced in recent years it has <Col N="563" /> been done at the expense of the less poor rather than the well off.</P>
    <P>The Minister read some recent Central Statistics Office figures today, which show that the income gap in society has steadily widened under his administration.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill 2001, is the Government's heartless attitude to pensioners and citizens on lower income more evident than in section 7. As the Minister for Finance desperately ransacked the national financial institutions to somehow balance his budget against the ideological and phoney parameters he set himself in 1997, his eyes greedily fell on the surplus in the social insurance fund. The raiding of 635 million from the fund means that the net real increase in social welfare this year is a paltry 444 million, or £300 million.</P>

      <P>Since the social insurance fund was established in 1953, no Minister for Finance has adopted such a cavalier attitude to the insurance fund of the workers and employers. My colleague, Deputy McDowell, rightly described the attitude as illegal last Wednesday. We are expected to retrospectively approve the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's assault on the fund in the remarkable and insufficient section 7(12). It remains to be seen if other elements of Deputy McCreevy's creative accounting, such as the taking of 610 million from the Central Bank and the transfer of 500 million from the capital services redemption account, will be approved by this House. The Labour Party continues to strongly oppose the Minister for Finance's attack on the social insurance fund and the complicity of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. For this and other serious reasons, my party opposes this Bill on Second Stage and will attempt to seriously amend it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is charged, under the Social Welfare (Insurance) Act, 1952, and section 122 of the Social Welfare <Col N="564" /> (Consolidation) Act, 1981, with the management and control of the current account of the social insurance fund and the Minister for Finance is charged with managing the fund's investment account. Sums payable from the fund are paid from the current account of the fund, as amended by section 16 of the Social Welfare Act, 1998. I note that money standing to the credit of the current account of the fund and not required to meet current expenditure must, according to legislation, be transferred to the investment account of the fund. Perhaps the Minister who has clear responsibility to this House for the current account of the fund, will clarify how he discharged his responsibilities with regard to the clear purposes for which the fund was established and is maintained with regard to the current draw-down for general revenue purposes.</P>
    <P>I find no legal basis or precedent in existing legislation for the actions of the Government. I believe, therefore, that the two-line formula for a once-off payment from the social insurance fund is open to serious question and has to be resisted. The decision to raid the social insurance fund bears all the hallmarks of the Attorney General, who wanted to abolish the fund when he was a Member of this House. My colleagues have mentioned that one of the Minister's clear mistakes in the past five years was his failure to give a modern legislative basis to the fund, despite the promise to do so in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, of which I have a framed copy. The Minister has failed to meet his basic aim of creating a board of management for the fund.</P>

      <P>When it became apparent that the Minister for Finance was acting <i>ultra vires</i> by attacking the social insurance fund, the response of the labour movement was most cogently expressed by the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. David Begg, who reminded television viewers of the reasons why the fund was established and supported by workers and employers more than 50 years. The fund has provided a range of basic benefits which are covered by section 2 of the Bill and for which workers have paid through social insurance contributions. Although the fund operates effectively as a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system, benefit payments <Col N="565" /> from it are often regarded, rightly, as a form of deferred salary. In this sense, the fund operates as a hypothecated tax on wages and salaries, which is why the Minister should not do what he is proposing to do. The fund exists to extend and develop the range of benefits paid for by workers and their families through worker protection and redundancy legislation. By diverting 635 million&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Mr. Begg noted last week, the anticipated social insurance fund surplus of 1.835 billion in 2002 offered a unique opportunity to enhance existing benefits and to introduce new ones. For several years, the Labour Party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have advocated the introduction of a PRSI-funded parental leave benefit. The Minister refused the ideal opportunity offered by Budget 2002 to introduce such an improvement for workers and their families. The inception of a parental leave benefit of four or five weeks was easily within the scope of a buoyant social insurance fund, but the Minister was not interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the opportunity existed for an innovative improvement to the home maker's scheme, which commenced during the partnership Government in April 1994. The scheme seeks to make it easier for a home maker to qualify for an <Col N="566" /> old age contributory pension at the age of 66. This was the Minister's last opportunity to extend the rights of all qualifying home makers, prior to 1994, but he spurned the chance to do something for older women. While increases in various pensions are welcome, the Minister might have significantly increased carer's benefit. An extension of the 65-week period, for example, or an enhanced improvement in the payment, might have proven more attractive for many carers who struggle with full-time jobs and demanding care duties.</P>
    <P>Another disappointment with this Bill arises in section 3, which heartlessly deals with the carers of Ireland. On budget night, the Labour Party received a stream of irate telephone calls and faxes from carers and their representatives, one of which came from the highly respected Carers Association, whose fax indicated that the group was disappointed by the budget. The association believes that the Government has failed to recognise the needs of thousands of carers who provide 24-hour care for frail and disabled people. The director of the body, Mr. Eddie Collins-Hughes, concluded that last Wednesday was a disappointing day for carers. Carers and their representatives were desperately taken aback by the miserable increase in the income disregards for carer's allowance. The disregards of £25.42 &ndash; 32.28 &ndash; for a single person and £50.85 &ndash; 64.57 &ndash; for a married couple will only bring the disregards to £150 &ndash; 191 &ndash; and £300 &ndash; 382 &ndash; from April 2002.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that, eight or nine months ago, the Taoiseach sent a message to a large meeting of carers of Limerick through the famous Limerick Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, which promised that the disregard for a couple would reach the average industrial wage. However, at the end of the year, and after the budget, this has not happened. This year only 3,400 additional carers will benefit from the new disregards. The Minister and the Government will leave office with the majority of full-time carers receiving no allowance at all, a fact highlighted by the figures in the review of carer's allowance by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Minister also cited CSO figures to this effect.</P>
    <P>The increase in the respite grant to £500 is welcome, but throughout the 28th Dáil the Labour Party has advocated a target of £1,000 per carer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>The small increase in the respite grant has not been accompanied in this Bill or in the new health strategy by the development of a nation-wide system of community care and guaranteed respite time for carers. More than ever the Labour Party is determined to transform the lives of carers. Deputy Quinn pledged at our national conference in Cork last September that any future participation by the Labour Party in <Col N="567" /> Government will abolish the means test for the carer's allowance and transform it into a properly recognised carer's payment. We are determined to allocate a portion of that payment to full-time carers already accessing other social welfare benefits. In Government the Labour Party will introduce a cost of disability payment and a nation-wide, enhanced network of community care and respite supports.</P>

      <P>The third essential reason the Labour Party is opposing the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill is its defiant failure to accept the final report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The trade union, community and voluntary pillars rightly advocated a preferred target of increasing the lowest social welfare rates to 27% of gross average industrial earnings in the short-term by 2003, and to 30% by the budget of 2006. The final report considered the target of 27% of gross average industrial earnings a reasonable policy objective and that it should be met in full no later than the budget announced in late 2006. This majority view did not rule out setting a higher target, such as 30% of the gross average industrial wage, the same target announced by the Labour Party. However, unfortunately the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs has heard that the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment refuse to accept these basic targets. Despite the Minister's irresponsibility in allowing the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to raid the social insurance fund, Deputy McCreevy has resolutely refused to implement the first step to even modestly decent social welfare incomes. Despite an almost unanimous raft of submissions from groups which work with the poor that basic welfare rates should increase this year by £14 a week to a minimum of £98, the response from this Government has been a miserly £8.06. The rates of long-term unemployment, one-parent family payment, blind pension, PRETA and disability allowance have only increased to £93.56 &ndash; 118.80 &ndash; a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the crest of the Celtic tiger and before we hopefully avoid a full-scale and lengthy recession, this farewell allocation for long-term recipients is <Col N="568" /> a slap in the face to the most vulnerable of citizens. Before last Wednesday I argued strongly for a basic welfare rate of £100 per week &ndash; 127. Such an increase would have given a good platform for the next Government to pursue the Labour Party's and the benchmarking group's target of 30% of gross average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge and welcome the amalgamation of supplementary welfare allowance, short-term unemployment assistance and long-term unemployment assistance into one higher rate which is also a change I advocated at the Labour Party's last national conference. However, even the increases in social insurance benefits in section 2 of the Bill are disappointing, with widow's and invalidity pensions going up by only £8 and disability and unemployment benefit only increasing by £8.06. Once again the Minister was constrained in improving social insurance benefits because he had needlessly given away a third of his projected social insurance fund surplus. As I have mentioned, this is also the reason he was fearful to develop new social insurance benefits or to improve existing ones.</P>
    <P>Most of the advocacy bodies for the large section of our society on very low incomes argued for the agreed 70% rate for qualified adult allowances to be front-loaded to 2002. However, the Minister seems to have lost the argument in Cabinet and Deputy McCreevy granted a paltry £8.06 in the assistance rates and £9.31 in the benefit rates. This society expects an adult citizen to live on an incredibly low £62.06 for almost all assistance QAAs on social assistance and the same rate for adult dependants of those on disability and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>This is the tenth budget I have witnessed in this House and every year I have had to refer to the disgracefully low levels of income on which this conservative-dominated House expects citizens to live. I also said this during the rainbow Government of which the Labour Party was a member. Is it any wonder that many of us on the left of Irish politics long for the day when there will be a majority left party in this House to truly represent the most vulnerable in society and to insist on a decent basic income?</P>
    <P>This year the Government reached its much vaunted target of £100 a week for non-contributory old age pensions and I welcome that achievement for which I commend the Minister. However, the £105.53 &ndash; 134 &ndash; is well below the 34% of gross average industrial earnings advocated by the trade union seniors' representative body and the seniors' parliament. For this reason the Labour Party and its spokesperson, Deputy McDowell, last year proposed a contributory pension £120 and £126 &ndash; 160 &ndash; for contributory pensioners this year.</P>
    <P>All sides of this House accept the need to allocate decent pensions to the citizens who created the framework for the recent massive growth in our economy and to ensure that these citizens receive their well deserved share of our new wealth. However, this Government has ada<Col N="569" /> mantly refused to address other serious quality of life issues for senior citizens, such as their security or care needs. It is estimated that about 40% of people will have long-term caring needs at some point when they get older, but this outgoing Government has paid little heed to them.</P>
    <P>Thanks to our trade union, voluntary and community sector colleagues through the PPF we have had the second stage of the major development in child benefit this year and the £25 and £30 increases are welcome. I give the Government credit for this increase. However, it is disappointing that child benefit improvements are not included in this Bill and that parents must wait until next April and May to receive these increases. Improvements in child benefit do not create a much needed national child care system which is an important area which the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, is leaving to the next Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy boasts of his introduction of the tax credit system, but he did nothing to utilise the system in the past two budgets to assist poorer working families by, for example, introducing an earned income refundable tax credit. Many community bodies, particularly the St. Vincent de Paul, have queried the Government's refusal to improve child dependent allowances as a targeted child income measure. Since the rainbow Government, when Deputy De Rossa was Minister, the child dependent allowance rate has not been increased from the basic £13.20. This lack of an increase in five years of an important social welfare allowance may well be a fitting epitaph for this Government. That is the reason the Labour Party supported the proposal of the Combat Poverty Agency to increase the lowest CDAs to £15.20 per week in a two-year strategy.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed about the future of the free schemes since the Minister gave the impression earlier this year that they were being merged into a single household benefit. I received telephone calls from people who thought the schemes were being abolished and replaced by a small cash payment. This was the Minister's original intention, but I am glad he has abandoned it as this benefit in kind is a key part of most pensioners' budgets and those of carers and those on invalidity benefit.</P>
    <P>The proposal to streamline the conditions and applications for electricity, gas and telephone allowances from May 2002 is welcome, as is the extension of the free travel companion pass to persons receiving invalidity pensions. I also welcome the increased number of units for electricity and gas allowance. The weekly income threshold for family income supplement has been altered by a disappointing amount. I hope the Minister will look again at this provision on Committee Stage. The fuel allowance has been increased by £2.09 to £7.09 &ndash; 9 &ndash; from January 2002. This is the first increase in this allowance since my colleague, Mr. Barry Desmond, was Minister for Social Welfare in 1984. Given the recent UCD <Col N="570" /> research which showed that up to 2,000 older Irish people die as a result of fuel poverty each year, this very belated and small increase in the fuel allowance is also welcome. Much more needs to be done by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure that the terrible toll of senior citizens as a result of fuel poverty is brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I welcome Annexe C, a poverty proofing exercise which we were shown last Wednesday. However, the two and a half pages of poverty proofing amount to a derisory and cursory exercise. It made little reference to the real impact of social welfare payments or the fact that the minimum wage is still liable to tax and it did not refer to the impact of the increase of 1% in VAT or the increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel, which will have an impact on poorer families, particularly in rural areas. For that reason, we need a more thorough poverty proofing exercise. In the coming weeks I hope we see more information from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on this area. The Government is still not committed to real poverty proofing of its achievements.</P>
    <P>The Government has done very little work in the area of spatial inequality and I have heard much criticism of the Government's failure to make any change in direct provision for asylum seekers. After five budgets which were skewed in favour of the rich, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has failed to arrest the growing divisions in our country based on income. This budget was somewhat better than its four predecessors but the Social Welfare Bill still fails to deliver the key social advances long desired by society. I oppose the Bill on the three grounds I have outlined: the Bill rejects the report of the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group; it has betrayed the carers of Ireland and has not given the fundamental advances they were expecting; and it discloses an amazing, shoddy and unjust attack on the social insurance fund, setting a bad precedent. For these reasons, the Bill should not be read a Second Time.</P>

It is particularly important that payment dates are being brought forward to 1 January.

      <P>The Government has increased contributory pensions by almost 50%.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the nature, extent and impact of illegal dumping in County Wicklow which is a source of grave concern for people living in my constituency. Today's newspapers carry reports of yet another dump discovered in the county, which appears to contain as many as 2,000 drums of hazardous or toxic commercial acids, including sulphuric acid. The nature of the dumping is known. It includes hazardous waste matter drawn from acute hospitals in Dublin as well as this potentially toxic waste. The extent of it stretches credulity, with hundreds of thousands of tonnes dumped in a highly organised manner in quarries and sites located close to a main road. The possible impact of this illegal activity is devastating. The danger to public health is immediate, with watercourses in the area endangered and even the lives of workers investigating these dumps being put at risk because of their instability.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government saw for himself the extent of this criminal activity when he made a visit to the area last week, yet no definite policy or strategy has emerged since. No doubt he knows that Wicklow County Council is doing its best to deal with this scandal but he must also be aware that what has happened is the result of highly organised, highly lucrative activity which is now so seriously regarded by society as a crime that, if found guilty, such a criminal can be fined up to £10 million or imprisoned for ten years. Yet in the case of the most extensive, dangerous and lucrative dumping discovered so far, the Garda has not yet been called in to investigate. The Minister has indicated that the Criminal Assets Bureau should have a role. A Department official has been quoted as saying that they wanted the CAB to come in and look at the whole area. Yet nobody, neither the Minister nor the local authority, has called in the Garda. Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a woman steals a pair of tights from Dunnes Stores the police are called in, yet when organised groups of people, some of whom are being linked with major criminals in Dublin, break the law systematically for huge profits the Garda are not called. Why? The money being made by illegal dumping is on a par with the money being made from major drug dealing. Why have not company records been seized, interrogations carried out and bank records been inspected? Why have the full rigours of a criminal investigation not been carried out by those who have the power to do so? The profits made are unimaginable and we <Col N="574" /> may not ever know the real figure. This money could be resting securely in an offshore account while local authority officials are trudging their way to the courts.</P>
    <P>The first discovery was made on 22 October 2001 yet nobody has been charged for the dumping, whether for an indictable offence or not. There is one man who has been convicted on a totally unrelated incident and I understand that he is out on appeal at the moment. Considerable costs have been accrued by the county council and more will follow for legal action. The clean-up will cost millions of pounds. Yet even after his visit to west Wicklow the Minister was unable to give any comfort to the county council. He did not say that these costs would be carried by his Department or that it would make any contribution while due legal process took its course. This is a disturbing rebuff to a local authority that is struggling to cope with a situation that is unprecedented both in its scale and in its criminality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for affording me the opportunity to make a contribution on this very serious issue. For several weeks now the subject of illegal dumping has occupied centre stage in County Wicklow and all the indications are that it will continue to do so for some time. It is a problem that is not unique to County Wicklow and in time, I regret to say, right around the country many more illegal dumps will be uncovered. The locations of these are known to many people and it is incumbent on those who have the knowledge to come forward and give it to the relevant local authority so that the extent of this problem can be gauged and addressed.</P>
      <P>There is universal condemnation of illegal dumping, particularly when it contains hazardous waste and may pose a threat to the water supply. While I agree that waste management is the direct responsibility of local authorities, we must ask why this situation has arisen. Waste should be relatively easy to track; it is bulky, it smells and it has to go somewhere. Yet it appears that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste have been illegally dumped in our countryside. Our present policy has clearly failed and the Minister must address its shortcomings. If local authorities are not doing their work they should be brought to task. Much speculation has appeared in the media in recent days about additional finds in Country Wicklow and the Minister, having visited the county, is well aware of the difficulties being encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is several weeks since the discovery of the first site but the waste remains unmoved from the site at Coolnamadra. This is totally unacceptable and the Minister should use his office to deal with this. The county manager and council are using all the resources at their disposal to deal with the problem but they have limited manpower and a limited budget. If we are really serious about cleaning up this mess several suspected illegal dumps should be inspected concurrently instead <Col N="575" /> of the present method of investigating one at a time. If we keep up the present rate of progress it will be years before we can say that the problem has been dealt with. Let the indignation be replaced by action. We urgently need additional resources now and I hope that the Minister will have some good news for me in his response.</P>
    <P>At this stage I believe no local authority is in a position to say there is no illegal dump in its backyard or under its control nor can it say with confidence that its authorised landfills contain no hazardous waste. Waste management is a problem easily identified and easier still to condemn, but generally short on solutions. One-line soundbites will not solve this. There must be political will at local and national level and the Minister should lead the way. If the present structures do not work they should be changed. However, no matter what route is taken, adequate resources and investment are required.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, we have a problem in Wicklow. It is not the only county and it will not be the only county where this has occurred. There is a lot of condemnation, but we want to see some action. The council is stretched to the limit. We have more than 90 suspected landfills; some commentators say 200, some say more. Only two have actually been uncovered; one is being dealt with and another is in the process. There are many others out there and we need resources. We do not want to deal with them in a drip, drip, drip fashion. If the problem is to be taken seriously the resources should be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McManus and Timmins for raising this matter in the House. I share their concerns about the ongoing disclosures of illegal dumping activity in Wicklow. The Government's position on this issue is clear. Unauthorised dumping of waste is both illegal and grossly irresponsible. Dumping of clinical waste or other potentially hazardous wastes is, because of its nature, particularly reprehensible. The full rigours of the law should apply to anyone found guilty of such activity.</P>
      <P>The functions of waste regulation and enforcement have been assigned under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to local authorities or for the licensing of major waste activities, to the Environmental Protection Agency. Local authorities must deploy the necessary resources to ensure that they effectively oversee waste movements and activities within their functional areas and take determined action, utilising the very significant powers and remedies available to them, to counter unauthorised activity. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no direct function in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unable to comment on the specifics of the recent cases. In any event, it would be inappropriate to prejudge the outcome of the investigations of Wicklow County Council and any actions aris<Col N="576" /> ing from these. To facilitate effective enforcement local authorities have significant powers to enter and inspect lands and premises and to board vehicles. There are very severe penalties available under the Waste Management Act, 1996, for illegal dumping activity. A person guilty of such an offence would be liable upon conviction or indictment to a fine of up to £10 million and/or up to ten years in prison. The Minister and I are anxious that where a local authority uncovers evidence of systematic and large scale dumping it should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to be prosecuted as the serious offence that it is, rather than dealt with as a summary offence. To that end my Department has consulted the Office of the DPP to prepare guidance for local authorities regarding relevant procedures and preparation of evidence.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that a landowner who is complicit in unauthorised dumping could also be liable to prosecution, in addition to the person who actually carried out such dumping. Furthermore, a landowner could be liable for the costs of removing and properly disposing of the wastes concerned. In addition, my Department has formally requested the Criminal Assets Bureau to consider whether, in the public interest, it should investigate the possibility of systematic and illegal profiteering being involved in unauthorised waste dumping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The law has also been strengthened in relation to the collection and movement of waste. The recent Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations, 2001, will facilitate better control of waste movements and should prove valuable in combating illegal dumping of waste. Under these regulations, all commercial collectors of waste have been obliged to apply to local authorities for waste collection permits. Under the new regulations, local authorities must require permit holders to ensure that the waste collected is transferred to a waste facility that has been licensed by the EPA or holds a permit from the relevant local authority. The system also provides for a documentation and tracking system for the movement of all wastes. A local authority would be entitled to refuse to grant a collection permit, or to revoke one that had been granted, in the event that an applicant being found guilty of any one of a number of specified waste offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of additional resources, the introduction of the proposed landfill levy will generate significant revenues for the new environment fund. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, intends to direct much of this funding <Col N="577" /> to support local authority enforcement initiatives in respect of unauthorised waste activities.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Act 1996 already provides for the recovery of clean-up costs. Where a local authority takes measures to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, it may recover the costs of such measures from such persons as the courts determine to be persons whose acts or omissions necessitated such measures.</P>
    <P>Where a person has held, recovered or disposed of waste in a manner that is causing or has caused environmental pollution, it is also open to a local authority to seek a court order requiring that person, among other things, to mitigate or remedy any effects of the said activity.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, a local authority should seek to recover clean-up and remediation costs arising from unauthorised dumping activities using these available remedies.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to diminish the seriousness of the unauthorised dumping cases currently known, or the possibility that other such cases will emerge, there has been an element of misinformation and speculation in some reports.</P>
    <P>For instance, it has been stated that some 2,000 sites nationally have been identified as potentially contaminated by hazardous waste. In fact, an EPA desktop study indicated that about 2,000 sites exist in Ireland that may, because of current or historical activities associated with them, be contaminated.</P>
    <P>These would largely comprise sites where certain trade and industrial activities took place, e.g. gasworks or tanneries. Most of these sites did not involve waste disposal <i>per se</i>. The EPA estimates that about 490 sites, including 84 operational facilities, may have been used for the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that Wicklow County Council and other local authorities pursuing cases of illegal dumping fully appreciate the seriousness of the cases in question. I am confident they will be rigorously pursued to determine the identities of those responsible, and that effective action will be taken.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Dukes for moving this motion. We live in a society where the death of a member of the police force in the course of duty remains profoundly shocking and a cause of great sadness in our community as a whole. Tonight we have the opportunity to place on the record of the House our appreciation of the service which John Eiffe rendered to the State as a dedicated member of the Garda Síochána. We are together in expressing our deepest condolences to his wife Lorraine, his children Andrew, Alison, Michelle and Rachel, all his wider family, his friends, and his colleagues in the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I know the House appreciates that I am particularly constrained in what I can say about the tragic events in Abbeyleix last Friday afternoon. Four people are facing charges in relation to this matter and I do not want to say anything which, however inadvertently or remotely, might impinge on the trial of those persons.</P>
      <P>Subject to those constraints I can tell the House that I have been advised by the Garda authorities that, arising from specific targeting of criminal elements suspected of involvement in armed robberies throughout the country, on Friday 7 December 2001, as part of the ongoing investigation into such activity, Garda units were tasked with carrying out counter operations with the objective of apprehending those responsible.</P>
      <P>Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., as part of that operation, gardaí from specialist national units based in Dublin were on duty in Abbeyleix when three cars, occupied by those being targeted, arrived outside the Allied Irish Bank. Gardaí confronted these suspects and shots were discharged by a Garda unit, resulting in the death of one member of the Garda and minor injury to another.</P>
      <P>In a follow-up search, a sawn-off shotgun, seven cartridges, a stun-gun, a bullet-proof vest, a balaclava, gloves, binoculars and walkie-talkie radios were recovered. Four people were arrested at the scene, two of whom received treatment for injuries sustained during the incident. All four were subsequently charged with criminal offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within hours of the tragic events last Friday, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner Kelly to investigate all the circumstances surrounding Detective Sergeant Eiffe's death. I have no doubt that the investigation will be thorough. While of its nature it must be pains<Col N="579" /> taking, I know that the commissioner is anxious that it will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner has also made it clear that he is anxious that the findings of the investigation be put into the public domain. I will ensure that this House is informed of those findings as soon as it is practicable to so do. In this context, the House will appreciate that the timing of this may be partially contingent on the status of the cases which I mentioned are before the courts at present.</P>
    <P>We need to await Assistant Commissioner Kelly's findings before we can make any judgments about this matter. I have no doubt that lessons learnt will be fully taken on board.</P>
    <P>Members of the specialist Garda units involved carry out work &ndash; much of it by its nature unpublished &ndash; which is vital to protecting the security of the State and the safety of our community. I pay tribute to all members who serve in those units and assure them of our support at this tragic and traumatic time. Members of the Garda Síochána involved have been offered the assistance of counselling and welfare services.</P>
    <P>At the removal in the church at Ratoath last evening the local curate, Fr. Crosbie, very eloquently attempted to console John Eiffe's family. I know I am speaking for the entire House when I say our thoughts are with the family and that it is right that the service which he gave selflessly to the community should be honoured here this evening. Fr. Crosbie said last night that this tragic and untimely death had cast a shadow of unspeakable sorrow over the parish. That shadow has been cast, too, over the wider community and this House. Detective Sergeant Eiffe's wife and family can forever be proud of the role he played in our nation's history. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue here this evening. The EU Commission has recently proposed reductions of 60% for the principal species fished in EU waters. It was stated that these proposals are justified by current trends in stock levels. As I understand it, the Commission proposes that these cuts would be implemented across the board. Reductions of this magnitude, 60%, would spell disaster for the Irish fishing fleet, for fish processors and all those employed in catching, processing and marketing fish here.</P>
      <P>Issues arising in connection with the allocation of fish resources in EU waters are dealt with in the document, Proposals and Recommendations for the Review of the Common Fisheries Policy, 2002, drawn up by the Irish National Strategy Review Group on the Common Fisheries Policy. That initiative between the Government and the industry was commendable and some excellent work has been done. It now remains to be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> This document points out that there are a number of difficulties with the allocation criteria applied to Community fish stocks. In relation to management it states: &ldquo;In essence, those that do the greatest damage are awarded the largest quota.&rdquo; The Minister will be familiar with the reason the group reached that conclusion. The report goes on to suggest a range of additional factors that might be included in future allocations. It states: &ldquo;These include compliance with control regulations, previous efforts to conserve the stock, history of research into fishery and zonal attachment of the stock.&rdquo; It is essential that these considerations be brought forward by the Minister in any discussion of overall reductions in the EU fishing effort.</P>
    <P>If, as seems to be the case, stocks of the major species in EU waters are at dangerously low levels, the responsibility must be laid on the shoulders of those who have done the most damage. They are, in general, the fishing fleets of the larger member states and the out-flaggers. If we were to apply those suggested criteria they would provide a well researched and well based means of securing a better position for the Irish fishery fleet in the overall picture. For example, one of the suggested criteria is compliance with control regulations. It can fairly be said that Irish fishermen are probably more tightly controlled than any other member state and, as far as I can establish, have a better record of conformity with regulations than fishermen of any other member state.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing fleet can argue that it has done more to conserve the stock than most of the other fishing fleet that fish in EU waters and there are large parts of the zone, particularly the Irish box, where the criterion of zonal attachment of the stock would count largely in our favour. No objective or realistic analysis of the damage done to the stocks can conclude that the Irish fishing fleet has been a major offender. This must be reflected in a differential application of any reductions that are to be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me this opportunity to deal with the issue of the European Commission's proposals for fish quotas for 2002. These will be the subject of detailed discussions and negotiations at a meeting of the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers on 17 and 18 December. I am pleased to be able to brief the House on my strategic approach to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission has tabled its proposals for 2002 in light of the scientific recommendations, stock assessments and management advice it has received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, advisory committee on fisheries management and the EU scientific, technical and economic committee. The Commission requested the scientific bodies to adopt the precautionary principle in preparing their advice for next year. The precautionary approach provides that uncertainty <Col N="581" /> about, or lack of data on stocks requires the application of very conservative management measures. The Commission has adopted this very conservative scientific advice and in many instances proposes cuts, which go beyond it.</P>
    <P>There is widespread concern about the severity of the cuts proposed by the Commission and the fact that they are applied across a very wide range of species. In short, the Commission is trying to apply a much more conservative approach to fisheries management, solely through quota cuts done over one year, irrespective of their impact on the fishing industry. The Commission's approach is to reduce the total allowable catches in accordance with the advice for stocks in need of recovery and to reduce all of the stocks caught with recovery stocks, irrespective of the science on those stocks. In short, the cuts for a whole range of species are driven by the scientific advice on the most vulnerable species.</P>
    <P>While it is accepted that the scientific advice on a number of species of interest to Ireland is of concern, it is our view that a more focused series of measures are required to recover the stocks, rather than the blunt instrument of once off quota cuts. Over the past three years, Ireland has led the debate on stock recovery in the EU, based on protecting adult spawning fish during the spawning season and avoiding the catching of young fish. Ireland has negotiated the implementation at EU level of the Irish Sea cod recovery plan, the hake recovery plan off the south and west coasts and the north west cod recovery plan off the Donegal coast.</P>
    <P>These plans are showing the way forward but their benefit is not yet feeding through to the science. In our view they are the way to recover stocks rather than the Commission's proposed severe quota cuts, which affect some member states more that others. The Commission's proposed average reductions in total allowable catches is 33% across the broad range of whitefish stocks, with cuts of up to 60% in some species. These cuts would have a disproportionate effect on Ireland because of our small quota entitlements under the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    <P>The context within which I am working to maximise fishing possibilities for Irish fishermen next year is, therefore, both complex and very difficult. It is not possible or correct to ignore the scientific advice and we must act responsibly to protect the resource into the future. However, this does not mean that the level of cuts proposed by the Commission is justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister is working in close partnership with the Irish fishing industry, as acknowledged by the Deputy. The industry has been fully briefed on the scientific advice and on the Commission's proposals and the Minister will work in the Council, with the support of the industry, to negotiate the best possible deal in the circumstances for our fishermen. Our overall objective will be to maximise the fishing possibilities for the Irish fishing industry next year, while ensuring that essential conservation objectives are met <Col N="582" /> through setting prudent and sustainable total allowable catches, which will enable the restoration and viability of stocks.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Marine Institute have examined, in detail, the scientific advice for all stocks and the Minister will take their analyses into account in recommending an increase over the Commission's proposal for any particular stock. It is very important to maintain stability for the fishing industry and Ireland is opposed to dramatic fluctuations in total allowable catches. We will, therefore, seek moderate increases or lesser reductions where there is justification on scientific or management grounds.</P>
    <P>The Commission should take account of the needs of fishermen as well as the fish stocks. The Minister will approach the issue with the aim of striking the appropriate balance between the conservation imperative and ensuring viable economic opportunities to protect the livelihoods of the fishermen concerned. He will urge his EU colleagues and the Commission to work on striking the right balance. We must secure the future of stocks while providing realistic economic opportunities for the fishing industry next year. The achievement of this balance will be very difficult and the negotiations will be tough and long.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Minister has consulted the representatives of our fishermen on the Commission's proposals. He met the UK Fisheries Minister in London yesterday on matters of mutual concern in negotiations on fisheries quotas for 2002. He is due to meet the Northern Ireland Fisheries Minister, Bríd Rodgers, on similar issues in Dublin tomorrow. He will meet the Belgian Fisheries Minister, who holds the EU presidency, in Brussels on Thursday to outline Ireland's position on the Commission's proposals. In addition, he will put Ireland's concerns to Commissioner Fischler during a high level bilateral meeting, before negotiations commence at the Council.</P>
    <P>The agenda for Council is scheduled to include the formal signing off on the EU Norwegian fisheries agreement for 2002. The annual negotiations with Norway are still in progress. However, it is anticipated that the negotiations will result in an increase in the Irish mackerel quota to approximately 73,500 tonnes for 2002. This will be good news for the Irish pelagic fleet. In addition to the proposed quota cuts for traditional species, the Commission has just published a proposal to establish quotas for a wide range of deep water species based on historic catch patterns. These fisheries are new to Ireland and the Commission's proposal based on track record is unacceptable to Ireland as it will reward those who have done most damage to these stocks. There is also clear scientific advice that quotas are not the right way to protect these species.</P>
    <P>Finally, international negotiations are taking place between the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands in Brussels this week on the blue whiting stock. These negotiations may lead to a significant reduction in the European Union's access to <Col N="583" /> this stock. We are working with our fishing industry at these negotiations to seek to minimise the impact on Ireland.</P>
    <P>This will be a very tough Council, indeed the toughest Fisheries Council for many years. We do not underestimate the difficult challenges of delivering on our objective to maximise sustainable fishing opportunities for 2002 while <Col N="584" /> ensuring the long-term future of fish stocks in our waters. We will continue liaising very closely with the Irish fishing industry on our negotiating stance. The House can be assured that we will negotiate very hard on these issues and give full commitment to getting the best deal possible next week for the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 December 2001.</P>

    <P>In relation to comparisons with other EU states, I am not aware of any source of information which would be directly comparable with the above figures. Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure across the different EU member states. <Col N="586" /> However, as well as encompassing social welfare expenditure, social protection expenditure, as defined by Eurostat, also covers expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes, for example, certain FÁS programmes and other social inclusion programmes. This is very different from the definition of &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; as we understand it in this country.</P>
    <P>The latest year for which this Eurostat information is available is 1998. In that year, social protection expenditure &ndash; broadly defined as set out above &ndash; in Ireland represents a lower proportion of GDP than the EU average: the proportion in Ireland is 16%, compared to an EU average of 27.7%. I might add that while international comparisons usually use GDP, it is recognised that in Ireland GNP, rather than GDP, is a better measure of the income available to society. The figures based on GDP understate the proportion of our income that is spent on social protection.</P>
    <P>In addition, the fact that we have a relatively young population means not just that our pension costs are lower, but we also have lower costs on health care and caring generally. Furthermore, due to lack of date on occupational pensions and benefits in Ireland, the Eurostat figures seriously understate expenditure in this regard.</P>

      <P>Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision on a claim to social welfare payment made by a deciding officer of my Department or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowance has a statutory right to appeal. This statutory social welfare appeals process is administered by the social welfare appeals office which, since 1990, operates independently of the Department.</P>
      <P>The appeals officers have always been independent in the exercise of their functions. However, in 1990, in line with a commitment in the Programme for National Recovery, the social welfare appeals office itself was established as an independent and separately managed office with a separate executive.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1990, appeals were made to the Minister and administered by the Department. Since 1990, appeals are made directly to the chief appeals officer and are administered by the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision for the operation of the social welfare appeals process is already in legislation. The statutory basis for the system is contained in Part VII of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, <Col N="587" /> 1993 and in regulations made under the provisions of that Act. This legislation provides for the appointment of appeals officers and for various other procedures and powers necessary for the operation of the system. The legislation also outlines the powers and duties of the chief appeals officer.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and fair consideration. The system is accessible and informal which gives it significant advantages in terms of providing the best possible service for social welfare customers. In the exercise of their statutory functions, appeals officers are fully independent, a fact which has been recognised and commented on by the courts.</P>
    <P>The office publishes an annual report containing a commentary on trends in appeals and the reason for the incidence of certain types of appeals and highlighting, where necessary, the need for legislative change to remove anomalies and inequities. This report is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Surveys conducted by the office indicate that it continues to satisfactorily meet the purposes for which it was established. However, the office is now over ten years in operation and the executive of that office considers it opportune to have a consultancy study undertaken of the role, functions and organisation of the office. This study will include examination of its relationship with its various customers and examination of all the processes involved in dealing with claims to the appeals stage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures introduced in 1990 to separate clearly the appeals function from the Department by setting it up as a separate executive office have worked very well and that the office is effectively discharging its functions within the present statutory provisions. I do not have any plans for legislative change at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 304 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>The treatment benefit scheme provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. The PRSI contributions which are reckonable for treatment benefit are classes A, E, H and P. The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to these benefits vary depending on the age of the insured person.</P>
      <P>Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. Persons aged 66 or over are required to have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching age 66.</P>
      <P>A qualified adult dependant is entitled to treatment benefit based on the insured person's PRSI record provided she or he has gross earnings of £60 or less per week and is not in receipt of any benefit or allowance from this Department or a health board except carer's allowance, disablement pension, supplementary welfare allowance or child benefit.</P>
      <P>I have no specific proposals, at present, for changing the qualifying conditions of the areas within the treatment benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of the scheme is subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department and the question of further improvements would be a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the community welfare service in the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department, as part of my Department's series of expenditure reviews. The working group is composed of representatives from my Department, <Col N="589" /> the Departments of Finance and Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
    <P>The review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme will be examined. The review also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The first stage of the review involved an examination of the objectives of the scheme and included a widespread consultation process. A total of 145 submissions were received from users of the supplementary welfare allowance service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners, the health boards who administer the scheme and the trade unions representing community welfare officers.</P>
    <P>The working group originally expected to complete the review by the end of this year. This will not now be achieved as progress has been slower than anticipated given the number and nature of the issues involved. It is now hoped to have the review completed in autumn 2002 following which the report will be published.</P>

      <P>The possibility of introducing a payment for periods of parental leave, including the question of whether such a payment should be made by employers or in the form of a social welfare payment, is currently being examined by the working group which has been established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>This working group is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and comprises representatives from each of the pillars of social partnership, together with representatives of relevant Departments and agencies, including my own Department. The National Women's Council of Ireland is representing the community and voluntary pillar on this working group.</P>
      <P>It is expected that this working group will complete its deliberations shortly and its recommendations will be considered by the Government.</P>

      <P>Public policy has increasingly recognised that there are spatial concentrations of unemployment, poverty and exclusion where individuals, families and communities suffer a form of cumulative disadvantage. Such problems can best be addressed by targeted and integrated policy responses.</P>
      <P>County and city development boards are currently drawing up their county or city strategies for social, economic and cultural development, and these are due to be completed in early 2002.</P>
      <P>These strategies will have a strong focus on the achievement of greater social inclusion within their areas. The RAPID and Clár programmes, the establishment of pilot social inclusion units in nine local authorities and the ongoing roll-out of the national anti-poverty strategy to local level will greatly assist in delivering on this objective.</P>
      <P>At regional level, two regional monitoring committees have been established to oversee the delivery of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan, to monitor progress in development generally in the BMW and South and East regions, and to focus on the reduction of poverty and social exclusion within the two regions. Early in 2002 my Department, in co-operation with the Combat Poverty Agency, will engage with the regional operational programmes in a pilot project aimed at improving the assessment of the impact of the programmes on social inclusion.</P>
      <P>Rural poverty and urban disadvantage are, of course, key themes under the current review of the national anti-poverty strategy, which is almost finalised. The review process acknowledged the critical value of access to social infrastructure and services as a key determinant of the quality of life of people. More generally, the increases in social welfare rates and child benefit, and the removal of lower income earners from the tax net, announced in the budget, will further advance this Government's drive to increase the real incomes of those most at risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the initiatives contained in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, combined with the budgetary measures, will provide clear evidence of this Government's continuing commitment to every citizen of this State, no matter where they live.</P>

      <Quest>the number of non-contributory old age pensioners and non-contributory widows pensioners whose pensions have been reduced as a result of receiving British pension entitlements; the total amount reduced in 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28558/01]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than 106,000 pensioners receiving an Irish non-contributory old age or widowed person's pension. Of these, some 10,200 &ndash; 10% &ndash; also receive a British retirement pension. The British pension rates in these cases are less than the maximum rate of non-contributory pension payable in this country, hence the people concerned have an entitlement to Irish pension to, in effect, top up their British pension to the level of Irish non-contributory pension. Once awarded, the rate of Irish non-contributory pension payable to people with British pensions has to be adjusted for periodic changes in the rate of their British pension or changes in its value by reason of exchange rate movements. In this regard, there is a legal obligation on pensioners to notify the Department in the event of changes in their means for whatever reason.</P>
      <P>Pensions are reviewed by my Department as part of its ongoing review and control programme. The current review arose in the context of implementing improvements introduced in the 2000 budget in the assessment of capital for non-contributory old age and survivor's pensions. This involved the exemption of the first £10,000 or 12,697 of capital for pension purposes and was of significant benefit to some 23,000 pensioners. This figure included some 7,000 old age pensioners who, in addition to capital, had means from other sources &ndash; principally British retirement pensions &ndash; and the current value of such pensions had to be taken into account. This necessitated a complete review of these particular cases.</P>
      <P>In this context, some 6,414 pensioners with British pensions have had their Irish old age non-contributory pension entitlement re-assessed so far this year &ndash; up to the end of November. Of these, 3,560 pensioners &ndash; 55% &ndash; have had their pensions reduced due to increases in their means; 127 pensioners &ndash; 2% &ndash; had their pensions withdrawn as their means exceeded the statutory limits for entitlement; 2,433 pensioners &ndash; 38% &ndash; experienced no change and a further 294 pensioners &ndash; 5% &ndash; received an increase in their Irish pensions. The average weekly reduction was £14.00 or 18.00 for the cases involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in the year 2000, approximately 2,000 people who were in receipt of widow(er)'s non-contributory pension were reviewed as part of the implementation of the improved capital means disregards introduced in the budget that year. Approximately 305 or 15% of these widowed people experienced a rate reduction as a result of increases in their means, of whom 146 had income from a British retirement pension. The impact of the review was less significant in the case of widowed persons as their means had been recently reviewed in 1999. The remaining <Col N="592" /> 1,700 widowed people reviewed in 2000 either remained at the same pension rate, or received an increase in their pension as a result of the improvement in capital means assessment rules.</P>
    <P>More generally, it is open to any pensioner to request a review of their pension entitlement at any time in the event of a reduction in their means for any reason. Where such a review results in a change in pension rate, the pensioners concerned have the normal right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation, individual decisions relating to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The question relates to the insurability for PRSI purposes of certain people who were employed as senior trainees by FÁS and the consequential implications for their entitlement to social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P> Following an examination of this matter, my Department decided that the persons in question, who were employed by FÁS as instructors or trainers were insurable at the PRSI class A rate of contribution. FÁS had previously paid PRSI class J contributions for these employments.</P>
      <P>Details of all of the &ldquo;senior trainees&rdquo; in question and of the periods of their employment have been furnished to the Department.</P>
      <P>It will now be necessary to have the PRSI records of all these employees amended to reflect the correct (class A) PRSI status. The question of liability for arrears of PRSI contributions will be addressed when the periods involved in each case have been established.</P>
      <P>Due to the scale of the work involved in regularising the PRSI records for such a large number of employees, I regret that I cannot at this stage confirm what will be the amount of the liability in this case. It is hoped to have all of the individual cases fully resolved early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will arrange for the correction, as soon as possible, of the PRSI record of any person who wishes to make a claim to any benefit based on the class A contributions which were payable in respect of the employments concerned. In such cases the Department can treat the class A contributions as paid, pending a final resolution of the matter. As an interim measure, I have arranged to have the records of all of the people in question carry a special indicator which <Col N="593" /> draws attention to the fact that their records require this amendment.</P>
    <P>This will ensure that there will be no loss of entitlement to anyone making a claim to benefit from a current date. I have also arranged to identify any cases where any of the employees in question may have made a claim to benefit previously, and where these particular contributions would have had a bearing on the outcome of any such claim. Where any such cases are identified, any action which may be required to remedy the situation will be taken.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate that all employees will have their rights fully protected.</P>
    <P>FÁS has confirmed that the correct class A rate is now being paid in respect of the employees in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in a table which I propose to arrange to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Pension rates for older persons have increased dramatically over the period since 1998 and this trend has continued in the recent budget. When this Government came into office in 1997 the rate of old age contributory pension stood at £78 or 99.04 per week. We promised to raise it to £100 or 127 per week by 2002. We have more than achieved this target and the £10 or 12.70 increase announced in the budget brings a pension rate of over £116 in 2002. This amounts to an increase of nearly 49% since 1998 and to a real increase of 24%.</P>
      <P>In addition, as part of the review of the Action Programme for the Millennium, we also promised to raise the level of all social welfare pensions to a minimum of £100 or 127 per week. The £10 or 12.70 per week increase for pensioners generally provided for in budget 2002 ensures that this objective is also achieved and surpassed. From January next, all pension rates for older people are at least £105 or 133.32 per week.</P>
      <P>The budget also provided for a special increase of £12 or 15.24 per week in the maximum rate of widow's and widower's contributory pension for those aged 66 and over. This represents real progress towards achieving the commitment made in budget 2001 to bring the level of these payments up to the same rate as the old age contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Budget 2002 also provided for further significant increases of £10 or 12.70 per week for the qualified adults aged 66 or over of pensioners with proportionate amounts for those on reduced <Col N="594" /> payments. As a result, a pensioner couple on a full social welfare payment will get an increase of £20 or 25.40 per week.</P>
    <P>The budget also provided for a number of other improvements which will directly benefit pensioners. These include an increase in the number of units on electricity allowance by 300 units per annum with effect from February next and the introduction of a household benefits package, thereby streamlining the electricity, telephone and TV licence schemes into one combined package. This will ensure that all recipients will receive the full range of schemes. About 13,600 households who are currently in receipt of the electricity allowance will now have automatic access to the telephone scheme; an increase in the fuel scheme from £5 or 6.35 per week to £7.09 or 9 per week.</P>
    <P>The level of increases in weekly payments to pensioners along with the wide range of other improvements since 1998 clearly demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to secure the future of older persons in society.</P>

      <P>The report, &ldquo;Supporting Parenting: a Study of Parents' Support Needs&rdquo; was published and officially launched on 27 November. The report was undertaken by the Centre for Social and Educational Research, CSER, in the Dublin Institute of Technology, Rathmines under the families research programme, which I introduced in 1999 to support innovative, original research in the field of family policy and family services.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Supporting Parenting&rdquo; is a comprehensive and in-depth study of parents' perspectives on their parenting role and the supports available to them. The study involved 1000 parents, 800 mothers and 200 fathers with diverse economic, social and family backgrounds.</P>
      <P>It contains analyses of the interest shown by parents in parenting education and classes, the factors which influence them in their parenting styles, their concerns about the physical and parental care of their children and both parents' and children's views about the enjoyable aspects of parenting relationships.</P>
      <P>The parents surveyed identified a wide range of supports for themselves and their children. These include play, leisure and recreation facilities, financial support with child care expenses and for stay-at-home parents and additional support with day-to-day expenses for parents on lower incomes to assist with school costs and to facilitate parents' involvement in education and training.</P>
      <P>The report contains a series of recommendations to strengthen the family services infrastructure in Ireland. The establishment of the Family Support Agency is highlighted as providing a key mechanism to respond to the challenges of providing co-ordinated responses to the varied nature of families' support needs.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency Bill completed all stages in the Dáil two weeks ago and is at present before Seanad Éireann. It is my intention to establish the new agency as soon as the legislative process is complete.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues raised by parents surveyed in the study have been singled out for attention as part of the Government's &ldquo;Families First&rdquo; approach designed to make the promotion of family well-being central to policy. Major improvements have been introduced in child care provision, in the one parent family payment scheme and in opportunities for lone parents to access education, training and employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Budget 2002 for the second year in a row provides for record investment in child benefit for all children from April 2002. Weekly rates of all income support payments for families have been increased significantly. The weekly increases are to be paid from January 2002. Substantial <Col N="596" /> improvements have been provided for in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and in family income supplement in 2002.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.3 million or 1.7 million has been provided for the further development by the Family Support Agency of family counselling services in the voluntary sector and for the family and community resource centres &ndash; programmes identified in the report as providing important services to parents. The findings of &ldquo;Supporting Parenting: A Study of Parents' Support Needs&rdquo; will contribute to the further development of all of these services particularly in the context of the development of the responsibilities of the new Family Support Agency.</P>
    <P>Copies of the report have been circulated to Members of the Oireachtas, to researchers in the field of family policy and to the media. The report is being further disseminated to Departments, to the social partners, to voluntary and community groups with an interest in family matters and to other interest groups.</P>

      <P>The unemployment benefit and assistance schemes are designed to provide income support for people who have lost employment and who are unable to find alternative employment. The conditions for receipt of unemployment payments require, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person must be available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work. There is an onus on each person to demonstrate, on an ongoing basis, that these conditions are met by showing that he or she is making reasonable efforts to secure suitable full-time employment or self-employment This does not preclude a person from accepting part-time work in the absence of suitable full-time employment provided the person demonstrates that he or she continues to be available for work in respect of any days of unemployment.</P>
      <P>A person who has been laid off is entitled to an unemployment payment provided that he or she is fully unemployed for at least three days in any period of six consecutive days. Therefore, a person who takes up part-time work for three days or less per week may qualify for an unemployment payment in respect of the remaining days of the week provided he or she continues to be available for full-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <Quest>if he will report on anomalies, which senior citizen representative bodies contend exist, regarding pension entitlements of workers who pay a modified stamp rather than a full stamp.</Quest>

      <P>In order to qualify for old age contributory and retirement pensions a person must, amongst other conditions, have paid social insurance at an appropriate rate. Social insurance at the modified rate paid by many public servants does not provide cover for these pensions.</P>
      <P>Historically, most public servants were excluded from full social insurance cover because it was considered that they had provision within the terms and conditions of their public sector employments for adequate cover for contingencies such as sickness or old age and that the risk of unemployment was not a factor in their case. Full PRSI coverage was extended to new entrants to the public service in 1995 with consequent changes in the occupational pension arrangements. All other public servants continue to pay the modified rate of social insurance which does not give coverage for old age contributory or retirement pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of measures in place which allow those with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment. These arrangements provide for the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions in pro<Col N="598" /> portion to the periods of insurance completed at the Class A rate.</P>
    <P>More recently, I introduced a special flat-rate old age (contributory) pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to benefit people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. I understand that former public servants are one of the main groups benefiting from these measures.</P>
    <P>Another area which is of benefit to former public servants is the free schemes. In October 2000, the free schemes were extended to all people over 75 years of age regardless of their income or household composition. Further changes were introduced in May 2001 to bring the qualifying age down to 70. The schemes are also available to former public servants aged 65 to 69 subject to satisfying a means test and the necessary living alone conditions. These measures have made a major contribution to improving the position of those who paid a modified rate of social insurance.</P>

      <P>The telephone allowance scheme administered by my Department covers line and instrument rental and calls to the value of £1.90 or 2.41 in each two-monthly billing period. The scheme will benefit some 224,000 people this year at an estimated cost of £44.2 million or 56.12 million. These figures demonstrate the huge success of the scheme in catering for the needs of the target groups at which the scheme is aimed.</P>
      <P>Under present arrangements appropriate credits are applied directly to the relevant customer accounts with Eircom, in respect of land-lines only. Mobile phones are not at present covered under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of the existing arrangements involves the handling and exchange of significant amounts of data for claim processing, account authorisation, crediting of customer accounts and the discharge of the Department's liabilities to operators whose customers benefit under the arrangements. The extension of coverage to include mobile phones, and other telephone service providers under the new deregulated telecommunications market, would require companies interested in participating in these arrangements to invest in database developments and, possibly, to assign extra staff to handle the business.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. Guidelines on the application of these conditions are made available to deciding officers and are designed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments are applied in a consistent manner and have regard to the circumstances of the claimant.</P>
      <P>A person who has recently become unemployed, for example, within the last two to three months, would be regarded as fulfilling the availability for work condition where he or she is seeking to become re-employed in his or her usual employment, provided there is a reasonable prospect of this. However, if there is no employment available within a specialised field, or if a person fails to secure employment in his or her chosen field within a reasonable period of time, the search for work should, in the normal course, be widened to include other types of employment.</P>
      <P>People claiming an unemployment payment are asked for details of their efforts to find employment and some evidence of this would normally be required before a claim is allowed. Again this requirement is operated in a reasonable manner and is designed to ensure that only those who are genuinely seeking employment qualify for payment.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on each person to demonstrate, on an ongoing basis, that the qualifying conditions are met by showing that he or she is making reasonable efforts to secure suitable full-time employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>Persons who are put on a reduced working week must be available for full-time employment and must be seeking work for the periods during which they are not employed. To qualify for an unemployment payment, persons who work three days per week must be making efforts to find work for the other days of the week, or suitable full-time employment elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, seasonal workers, who can be unemployed at regular intervals, are required to be <Col N="600" /> available for and seeking work during periods of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions do not discriminate against any person, on age grounds or otherwise, with each case being decided on its own merits and in the context of local employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with the decision to refuse him or her an unemployment payment, the decision may be appealed to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to individual claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>Following the mandate from the Lisbon European Council in March, 2000, member states and the Commission have sought to develop common approaches and compatibility in regard to indicators. The work is being carried out by the social protection committee and its technical subgroup on indicators. The subgroup met regularly throughout 2001 and has concentrated, initially on improving indicators in the field of poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>This follows from the political agreement reached at the European Council in Nice, defining appropriate objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and inviting member states and the Commission to seek to develop agreed indicators. At Stockholm in March 2001, the European Council gave a mandate to the Council to adopt a set of commonly agreed social inclusion indicators by the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>A report with proposals for such a set of indicators from the social protection committee was unanimously approved by the Council for Employment and Social Policy at its meeting on 3 December and it is now being submitted for final approval to the European Council meeting in Laeken on 14 to 15 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work as indicated, has been has been fully supported by the Belgian Presidency. It commissioned a report by eminent academics on &ldquo;Indicators for Social Inclusion in the European Union&rdquo;. This report was broadly endorsed at a presidency conference in September and pro<Col N="601" /> vided useful independent corroboration for the work of the social protection committee.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the indicators is to allow member states and the Commission to monitor progress towards the goal set by the European Council of Lisbon of making a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by 2010, to improve the understanding of poverty and social exclusion in the European context and to identify and exchange good practices. In selecting the indicators consideration has been given to all the main areas to be covered and to national differences. The focus was on indicators that address social outcomes rather than the means by which they are achieved. It is also being recognised that a wide variety of indicators are needed to properly assess the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>These are being prioritised by placing them on three levels. Primary indicators would consist of a restricted number of lead indicators covering the important elements leading to social exclusion. Secondary indicators would support these lead indicators and describe other dimensions of the problem. Both these levels would be commonly agreed and defined and used by all member states. A third level of indicators would be those individual member states use to describe aspects of their own situation, but would not be harmonised at EU level.</P>
    <P>Ten primary and eight secondary indicators are being proposed in the social protection committee's report covering broadly levels of income, unemployment, health status and educational attainment.</P>
    <P>Further indicators will be developed in the coming years covering other aspects and will include living conditions, access to services, literacy and numeracy, housing and other aspects of health. Progress on their development will be crucially dependent on the relevant data being available in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>Ireland has fully participated in this process at all stages. We have brought to it our experience in developing indicators for the national antioverty strategy, particularly in relation to non-monetary indicators which, in complementing monetary indicators, give, in our view, a more balanced and realistic view of the real extent of poverty.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that the focus on measuring outcomes on an EU &ndash; wide basis will enable us to learn much on how to combat poverty and social exclusion more effectively in the years and decades ahead.</P>

      <P>The ESRI report referred to is a wide-ranging and detailed treatment of the concept of employability and the issues involved in addressing the problem. These issues, as the consultants note, transcend a variety of sectors, Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>The consultants recommend that a system of profiling be adopted to facilitate early identification of factors likely to lead a person to become long-term unemployed. Early identification would allow appropriate interventions to be provided, from a variety of bodies, to prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>My Department carried out intensive surveys of unemployed customers in Waterford and Galway last year. The ESRI has been contracted to carry out further analysis of the outcomes of these surveys. Part of this process will involve re-surveying original participants and using results to develop a statistical model of characteristics likely to lead a person to remain on the live register or to obtain employment. The consultants expect to be in a position to report on this process in mid-2002. Following on this other Departments, relevant agencies and the social partners will be consulted with a view to developing proposals to assist people with employability difficulties to access the labour market.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out that my Department is already engaged, as part of its employment support programme, in identifying and referring people on the live register who require a range of targeted supports to help them make the transition to work or further training and education. The types of services which my Department's jobs facilitators offer are broadly in line with the recommendations in the ESRI report.</P>
      <P>Additionally, in line with the report's recommendations, my Department has developed co-operation, at a variety of levels, with agencies such as FÁS, the vocational education committees and the National Adult Literary Agency to assist customers in moving from the live register, having regard to the particular problems which they may have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 282 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>The dispute in the Department's office in Letterkenny arose initially out of the filling of three additional temporary posts in the office by the recruitment of staff on short-term contracts. The staff are required for a limited period for work associated with the introduction of a new system for the delivery of child benefit from that office. In addition to child benefit the office also administers treatment benefit which comprises dental and optical benefits and medical appliances. Having commenced their industrial action in relation to the recruitment of temporary staff the union then stated that its actions also covered their dissatisfaction with the implementation of a new computer system for the delivery of child benefit services.</P>
      <P>The industrial action, which involves 157 clerical staff, commenced on 2 October 2001 with a ban on dealing with telephone and fax enquiries and a withdrawal of availability for overtime working. The action was extended on 30 October 2001 to include a ban on a range of other tasks and withdrawal of co-operation with the implementation of a new computer system for child benefit. While the industrial action is preventing people from making telephone and fax inquiries in relation to entitlements I would emphasise that claims continue to be processed and payments continue to be made.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of advertisements placed by the Department in respect of the dispute I can advise the Deputy that the cost to date is estimated at £34,000 or 43,171.09.</P>
      <P>The CPSU position in relation to the settlement of the dispute is that an offer of a substantial package of promotions in the Letterkenny office must be made by the Department to bring about a cessation of the industrial action. The Department cannot meet demands such as those now being made by the CPSU.</P>
      <P>To do so would have the effect of negating agreements already in place, thus introducing a system whereby changes designed to deliver improved services to our customers would have to be negotiated and paid for on an item by item basis. It would be impossible for the Department, which has over 2,600 staff in grades represented by the CPSU, in about 200 offices across the country, to manage improved service delivery and industrial relations on such an uncertain and confrontational basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of and regret the inconvenience to the public arising as a result of the <Col N="605" /> industrial action and I wish to stress that every effort is being made by the Department to bring about a resolution of the dispute. In this context, following a recent meeting between officials of the Department and the union, there have been ongoing contacts with a view to putting together a draft agreement aimed at bringing about a resolution of the dispute. Whatever resolution emerges, however, cannot be based on unilateral demands by the CPSU for a package of promotions. Any such package must be based on the business needs of the Department or alternatively, must be arrived at following discussions with the union on the implications of the new child benefit computer system for the career opportunities of its members in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>Following on from these earlier contacts, further discussions between the Department and the union are taking place today.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed since late 1998.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing is a major tool in ensuring that Departments are kept aware of the possible implications of policy on those most in need and it is a system this Government is committed to as part of its social inclusion strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist in the implementation of poverty proofing, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing and worked examples which were distributed to all Departments in 1999. The unit has also met with the strategy's liaison officers in all Departments and discussed poverty proofing with them in order to assist with any difficulties. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the poverty proofing arrangements have been reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council. The review examined issues such as how the pov<Col N="606" /> erty proofing process might distinguish between large integrated programmes and other more self-contained proposals. It also assessed how the poverty proofing process might be integrated with the broader policy proofing requirements, such as equality proofing.</P>
    <P>The NESC has now completed the review and its report, which was recently received by Government, is due to be published in the next few weeks. The recommendations contained in the report will be considered in the context of the implementation of the revised national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <P>Social welfare retirement and old age pensions are currently payable at 65 and 66 years of age respectively. The appropriateness of these qualifying ages is at present being considered in the context of the second phase review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which is ongoing at present. The first phase report was published in August 2000 and I expect to be in a position to publish the second phase report early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The introduction of progressive retirement is, of course, a much wider issue than the payment of social welfare or private pensions. Progressive retirement &ndash; on an early or a deferred basis &ndash; would have major implications for existing working arrangements, occupational and personal pension schemes. In the circumstances it would necessitate serious consideration by employers' organisations, trade unions and the pensions industry. Demographic projections for the ageing of our population, increased life expectancy, sustainability of pension payments in the future and domestic and EU objectives in relation to increasing workforce participation of older people are all issues which would have to be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The annual report of the <Col N="607" /> Society of St. Vincent de Paul, 2001, provides a timely reminder that, notwithstanding the outstanding economic success achieved over recent years, we must continue to focus attention on the needs of the most vulnerable sectors of our society. The Government shares the commitment of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to the achievement of an inclusive and fair society, and this commitment is reflected in particular in the budgetary policies we have implemented.</P>
      <P>The 2002 budget provides for an increase in welfare spending of £850 million, matching the record increase provided for in the 2001 budget. This means that, over the lifetime of this Government, the social welfare budget has increased by almost two-thirds, from £4.5 billion in 1997 to £7.4 million or 9.4 billion in 2002. With regard to social welfare rates we are providing a general increase of £8 or 10.16 per week in respect of customers under pension or retirement age, a rise of 7.4% to 9.4% depending on the payment concerned. In addition we are providing a special increase of £9.50 or 12.06 for those on the lowest rates of social welfare, supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance. This brings the lowest social welfare rates up to £93.60 or 118.80. In terms of overall poverty levels, the 1998 Living in Ireland survey shows significant reductions in the levels of consistent poverty in Ireland since 1994. Consistent poverty fell from 15% in 1994 to 8% in 1998, and we are therefore well on our way to achieving our revised national anti-poverty strategy target of below 5% by 2004. It is not clear, in this context, what source the Deputy is using in his reference to one in five of the population living on incomes of less than £90 per week i.e. 114.28.</P>
      <P>The success of policies over recent years in combating unemployment and reducing the level of consistent poverty demonstrates a tangible improvement in the lot of those on lower incomes notwithstanding the very rapid increase in average incomes driven by economic success. Our commitment is to strive towards the creation of an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country. We have given practical effect to that commitment in our economic, labour market and budgetary policies. The 2002 budget demonstrates in the clearest possible terms our ability to deliver in this regard.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for charity regulatory matters and the office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests has transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as outlined in the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship Between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector. The order to effect this transfer was made on the 27 July 2001. The Government is committed to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fundraising, in line with the recognition in the White Paper of the need for a more modern legal framework. The work of reviewing the legislation which is currently under way in my Department will be accompanied by a broad public consultation on the appropriate regulatory framework and the nature and extent of the legislative reform required. My Department has recently held discussions with the Law Reform Commission on this question. The Law Reform Commission has indicated that it will shortly commence an examination of charity law with a view to producing a report on the necessary legal reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is working in close co-operation with the commission in the preparation of the consultation document and in the reform of <Col N="609" /> the charities legislation. In this regard, my Department has recently sought and received proposals for consultants to review certain specific subjects in preparation for the public consultation. These proposals are currently under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have previously pointed out, a wide range of views exist on the complicated questions which arise in reviewing the current legislation. The fundamental nature of the review which I am carrying out requires as broad a consultation as possible with sufficient time allowed for consideration of such important issues. In this regard, it is envisaged that proposals for legislative reform will be brought forward, following completion of the consultation process which will begin in the early new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report to which the Deputy refers. It identifies the main issues affecting lone parents and reinforces the findings of other recent work in this area including my own Department's review of the one-parent family payment, OFP, published in September 2000, and the recently launched report on lone parents by the National Economic and Social Forum. The findings and recommendations of the report are very wide ranging and in many cases relate to the responsibilities of other departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>Access to information services is an area highlighted in the report and I have initiated a programme for one-parent family payment recipients to ensure that they are aware of the employment, education and training available to them. This has taken the form of a mailshot issued to all recipients last year and the Department's employment support services are also becoming increasingly active in inviting lone parents for interviews and offering assistance to access employment, training and education initiatives.</P>
      <P>I am also planning to localise the administration of the OFP scheme and a pilot project to that effect is under way in my Department's Tallaght office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concessions were also introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 2001 to try and improve the role maintenance payments play in the overall income of lone parents. Only 50% of maintenance received is now assessed for one-parent family payment purposes in addition to concessions <Col N="610" /> which already existed in respect of maintenance paid for housing purposes.</P>
    <P>In last week's budget I increased the rates of child benefit by £25.04 or 31.80 per month for each of the first and second children and £30.01 or 38.10 per month for the third and subsequent children and these increases will take effect from April. I have also increased the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for children aged over 12 from £78 or 99.04 to £94 or 120. In addition, I increased the personal rate of one-parent family payment by £8.06 or 10.23 per week. All these increases will be of major benefit to lone parents.</P>
    <P>The Government is strongly committed to eliminating poverty for all our people and recognises the particularly high risk of poverty faced by lone parents.</P>

      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we committed ourselves to revising and reviewing the national anti-poverty strategy. This process involved a review of the methodology underlying the strategy and a review and revision, where appropriate, of existing targets. New targets in the areas of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people, housing and accommodation and ethnic groups were also considered.</P>
      <P>A number of working groups, with social partner representation, were established to facilitate the review of targets, the development of indicators so that achievement of targets can be monitored over time, and the development of measures to meet those targets. The areas covered included housing and accommodation, health, employment and unemployment, education, rural poverty, urban disadvantage and income adequacy. A separate working group was also established to examine the issues in relation to benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The reports of each working group have been summarised by external consultants into an overall report and a steering committee, which includes the convenors from the working groups, representatives from relevant Departments, and representatives of the social partners and relevant agencies, has overseen the production of a NAPS framework document. This is currently being considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. I envisage that the revised strategy will be presented shortly to Government which will make final decisions in relation to the proposed targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> The review of the strategy allows for the consideration and inclusion of new themes that have emerged as national priorities over the past number of years.

      <P>At the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs I announced that I propose to prioritise research on this theme for funding under the families research programme.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to commission the research early in the new year under the new funding round of the families research programme. Meanwhile contacts are being made at official level with State bodies, research institutions and universities both at home and abroad to learn more about the experience of dealing with families in crisis and to gather the available research on this theme.</P>
      <P>This information together with the views of Irish experts working in this field will help to shape the terms of reference and focus the proposed research appropriately.</P>
      <P>My Department has been working closely with the National Children's Office which reports to my colleague, the Minister of State for Children, in progressing the research project. It is not possible at this early stage to state when the results from the research project might be available but experience with the families research programme to date would suggest that projects of significant size and scope may take up to two years to complete.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency Bill which completed all stages in the Dáil two weeks ago and which is this week before Seanad Éireann provides for a key role for the proposed new agency in supporting families going through marital breakdown. The importance of access to non-adversarial remedies such as family mediation, a core function of the new agency, in disputes involving children is increasingly evident.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to ask the Family Support Agency as one its first tasks to take the lead in exploring this issue and in coming forward to me with recommendations as to how our services can better respond to families in crisis and indeed what measures can be put in place to prevent families falling into the extreme distress which, unfortunately, we have witnessed on too many occasions in recent months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 292 together.</P>
      <P>Overpayments are set up as a result of fraud, failure by recipients to report changes in their circumstances or departmental error. During 2000, 33,362 recipients of social welfare payments were assessed with overpayments of £21.25 million or 26.98 million in respect of moneys received to which they were subsequently deemed not to have been entitled.</P>
      <P>Of these, 2,578, 7.7%, cases with a value of £800,600, which is under 4% of the total overpayments, arises in cases where, for instance, a person on unemployment payments returns to work but payment of benefit has issued before the notification is received. The bulk of such overpayments do not arise by reason of staff error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> It is my Department's policy to endeavour to recover all moneys incorrectly paid and every effort is made to recover overpayments in full having regard to the provisions of a code of practice which is in place to regulate this process. Where a person who has incurred an overpayment is in receipt of a social welfare payment there is provision to recover the overpayment by periodic deduction from current payments and the vast majority of overpayments recovered in this way. During 2000, deductions were made from the payments of some 33,000 social welfare recipients who had incurred earlier overpayments.</P>
    <P>The method and pace of overpayment recovery is determined having regard to the individual circumstances of those who have been overpaid and the amounts of periodic deductions are determined so as not to cause hardship. In a great many cases, therefore, recovery of the overpayment continues over a long period of years and this is the determining factor in the level of overpayments not disposed of. Where, however, a person has substantial resources, a more vigorous approach is adopted, sometimes culminating in civil proceedings for recovery. Where an overpayment was due to departmental error, there is provision to consider its reduction or cancellation, depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Under current statutory provisions governing the award of credited social insurance contributions &ndash; credits &ndash; lone parents who qualified for lone parents allowance or one parent family payment from October 1990 onwards may be awarded credits if they switched to that payment from another credit-bearing payment, for example, unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>As regards recipients of widow/er's contributory pension or non-contributory pension, the position is that credits are not awarded for periods of widowhood alone. However, a person who was in receipt of a credit bearing payment prior to qualifying for the widow/er's pension may continue to receive credits, provided she or he continues to satisfy the conditions of entitlement to the other payment, for example, by providing evidence of continuing illness or unemployment.</P>
      <P>The value of credited contributions thus awarded depends on the benefits for which the last paid contribution was reckonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a lone parent or widow/er whose last paid PRSI contribution was at the class A <Col N="614" /> rate will be awarded a credit reckonable for all benefits including the old age contributory pension and retirement pension.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's euro changeover project has been geared, from the outset, at ensuring a smooth transition to the euro, ensuring that payment continuity is maintained and also that our customers are fully aware of the change and the arrangements to effect the transition as they apply to them.</P>
      <P>At this stage, the task of effecting the changeover is almost complete. Payments spanning the change-over date are already in the hands of all beneficiaries who receive their payments by means of payment order books of personalised payment orders, PPO. This accounts for over 600,000 people receiving weekly payments and all families receiving child benefit. In the case of the remaining beneficiaries, whose payments are made by cheque, by direct credit to bank accounts etc. or are drawn at post offices using their social services card comprehensive arrangements are in place to ensure a smooth transition to euro payments from the beginning of January. These include persons receiving disability benefit, unemployment payments and supplementary welfare allowance and account for some 270,000 beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>The plans are for the conversion work in their case to be undertaken over the Christmas holiday period and, contingency arrangements to ensure full continuity of payments are in place to deal with any possible difficulties arising in the conversion process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also undertaken a major information campaign to inform people about the euro, with particular attention to the needs of pensioners and people with literacy and numeracy difficulties. This campaign involves television, radio, newspaper and bus and rail advertising, press releases and information leaflets, direct customer mailshots, public events including open days, posters widely distributed and information provided on the Department's website. The <Col N="615" /> Department is also co-operating with the Euro Changeover Board in the implementation of its public relations and information campaign.</P>
    <P>The Department will establish a freephone euro helpline to handle customer queries about any social welfare aspect of the euro changeover. The freephone will commence from 12 December 2001 and will remain available into the dual circulation period next year, which ends on 9 February 2002.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU law, we cannot require motor insurance companies to notify us of premium rates. Accordingly, our Department does not have authoritative statistics on average premiums. However, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is examining the factors that influence the cost of motor insurance and in particular, the relationship between the premiums being levied to different categories of drivers, including young drivers, and the claims experience of those categories.</P>
      <P>I will urgently examine the board's recommendations when received, within the overall context of what is legally and practically possible.</P>
      <P>While I cannot comment on all figures on performance published by insurance companies, investment income must be included in both financial reports made under company law and in the returns to our insurance division that form the basis for the insurance annual report.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain essential services currently provided by participants on community employment are being mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of community employment funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for these services. This process has already commenced in the case of community employment services in schools.</P>
      <P>Supervisors are employed by sponsors of community employment projects and these positions are funded by a grant from FÁS. Under the mainstreaming of schools services supervisors may be retained to manage dedicated schools projects for so long as at least five participants remain on the project. They will then remain for a further period of up to two months from the date of departure of the fifth participant to facilitate the orderly winding down of the project. The positions held by community employment supervisors will then be made redundant as the mainstreaming of such services is phased in and as projects are discontinued.</P>
      <P>FÁS employment services will make every effort to ensure that supervisors being made redundant are made aware of other employment opportunities, including those arising in the social economy, as this programme is rolled out, or in other community employment schemes. FÁS employment services will initiate contact with such supervisors and provide the full range of employment supports, including job placement or further training if required. In addition, FÁS will ensure that redundant supervisors, with their consent, are placed on the regional database of community employment supervisors for future prospective employers.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the background to this particular case.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that possession by a non-EU national of residency in another EU state, whether long-term or otherwise, does not confer on that person any entitlements in so far as permission to enter or reside in Ireland. Permission to work in Ireland depends on satisfactory immigration status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an employee remains with the same employer for five years, a work permit without limit may issue to that employer for the sixth <Col N="617" /> year. A work permit is issued to the employer, not the employee.</P>
    <P>The working visa-work authorisation scheme applies to sectors such as information and computing technologies &ndash; professionals and technicians &ndash; building professionals and nursing. This scheme makes it possible for prospective employees with job offers from employers in Ireland to obtain immigration and employment clearance in advance from Irish embassies and consulates. This scheme is a faster alternative to the work permit procedure which continues to be available to employers in Ireland. Consideration is now being given to extending it to a wider range of medical professionals. Initial enquiries suggested that there was no demand for it to be extended to accountants but any evidence to the contrary will be considered, having due regard to conditions in the Irish labour market.</P>
    <P>There is currently an eight week backlog in processing applications for work permits. There is no distinction made between applications, whether single or multiple. More than 35,000 work permits have issued so far in 2001. The number of work permits now extant is about 36,000.</P>
    <P>All employees in the State, regardless of their nationality or status, have the same level of protection under our labour laws and social protection framework.</P>

      <P>A decision was made by AnCO, the predecessor to FÁS, to classify some ordinary trainees as senior trainees. This was because, as well as updating their own skills, these persons also passed on some of their skills &ndash; previously acquired in employment &ndash; to ordinary trainees. This was highly beneficial and was supported by the European Union. Typically, such persons were employed by community groups on community training programmes such as the restoration of old historic buildings where special skills were required. However, they were not employed as tutors. They were course participants. Accordingly, they were insured under Class J PRSI &ndash; occupational injuries only &ndash; as with all FÁS trainees.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place in 2000 between FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to clarify the social insurance status of these senior trainees in the light of rulings by the Department that they should be insurable under class A PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS accepted this ruling but was not in a position to implement this decision because effec<Col N="619" /> tively it would result in such persons being regarded as employees of FÁS. Accordingly, it was decided that the appropriate community group would employ all new senior trainees on community training projects from 4 December 2000, as is the case with the foreman or supervisor on such projects. The senior trainees would then be employees of the community group and would be insured under class A PRSI.</P>
    <P>The above solution resolved the issue with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and also had the very beneficial effect for FÁS that persons formerly classified as trainees would now be employees in the workforce with all the associated benefits accruing.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs also raised the matter of correcting all records for previous senior trainees so that no person would be disadvantaged. FÁS has provided the necessary information to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to enable this to be done. The question of liability for arrears of PRSI contributions is also being addressed between FÁS and the Department but it is not possible at this stage, pending clarification of the periods involved in each case, to say what the extent of any such liability to FÁS might be.</P>
    <P>Finally FÁS has indicated that it has paid the correct PRSI contribution for its circa 600 tutors who are employed under a contract of service by the organisation, i.e. they are FÁS employees.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> The environmental impact statement, EIS, submitted to me by Enterprise Energy Ireland was put into the public domain by the company for consideration by interested parties who have until 27 December to make submissions or observations to me. Any submissions or observations received within the period will be referred to the company for comment. Copies of the EIS can be obtained directly from the company.</P>
    <P>The EIS, together with any submission or observations referred to and the company's comment thereon, will be fully and independently examined by the marine licence vetting committee with the assistance of independent consultants. That committee will report to me in due course to allow me to make a decision and its report will be published. There are no funds at my disposal for disbursement to local representative groups to assess the EIS.</P>
    <P>Until that examination has been completed, I am not in a position to take a view on whether or not the EIS is acceptable on the likely effects of the project on investment by fishermen or other persons in the area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Parliamentary Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture licences are subject to a variety of conditions designed to ensure best practice and the taking of all necessary precautionary-remedial action. It is a licence condition that all fish escapes must be reported immediately to the Department and to the regional fisheries boards. The cause of the escape must be established by the fish farm and necessary remedial action taken to address this. Stock losses must also be quantified.</P>
      <P>No escapement of 125,000 adult farmed salmon has been reported to the Department by any fish farm operator in the Cork-Kerry region. Last week the Department received a report from one fish farm operator advising that on completion of harvesting operations at a site in late November, a shortfall of 20,000 fish was reported from one cage. Prior to this the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board had received reports of farmed salmon being caught in their area. Routine diving checks of nets and the cages at the farm throughout the year and following harvesting operations did not indicate any structural damage to nets or cages. To date internal investigations by the company have not established the reason for the shortfall. The South-Western Regional Fisheries Board and the Department are continuing investigations into the incident. The matter has also been reported to the Garda.</P>

      <P>Under the Fisheries Acts the regional fisheries boards have responsibility for the issue of salmon fishing licences. The legislation provides that where an application is made for a salmon rod licence to a regional board such licence shall be issued by the board.</P>
      <P>The issue by the regional boards of commercial salmon fishing licences is regulated by the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders, 1980 to 1996. The orders prescribe: the classes of persons to whom there may be issued licences and the kind of fishing engines in respect of which such licences may be issued; the maximum number of licences which may be issued in any year by a board for a fishery district or other place; the time and manner of application for such licences; and the manner in which such licences shall be allocated in any case where the number of valid applications for licences exceeds the maximum number prescribed.</P>
      <P>My Department is requesting the Central Fisheries Board to provide the Deputy with the number of licences issued by the regional boards in 2001.</P>
      <P>At present my Department together with the fisheries boards and the national salmon commission is conducting a comprehensive review of the provisions of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders in the light of my objective to achieve meaningful reductions in salmon catches involving all sectors in 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 87 and 89 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1938, every fishery and every fishing right on the Shannon above Corbally Weir was vested in the ESB. They <Col N="628" /> are responsible for managing, conducting and preserving the Shannon fisheries. This responsibility is expressed to be subject and without prejudice to the primary function of maintaining, developing and working the Shannon hydroelectric works.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board informs me that the ESB, as primary owners of the fishery rights to the River Shannon, undertake restocking of the system with eels and salmon. The Shannon board in conjunction with the Central Fisheries Board restock those parts of the Shannon system under the management of the fisheries board with trout and coarse fish. I have asked my Department to request the ESB and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to provide specific details of their conservation and restocking operations directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Under the Tourism Angling Measure of the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-1999 the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board invested in excess of £2 million in the development of fisheries in the Shannon catchment, including flagship projects on Loughs Sheelin and Ennel where some £800,000 was invested. The Shannon board also inform me that they are in the course of the preparation of a plan for the further development fisheries under their management and control. This plan will form the basis for funding proposals under the new tourism and recreational measure of the NDP.</P>

      <P>Membership of the European Union has been of immense benefit to Ireland and full participation in the Union will continue to be essential to our national development. This is the fundamental reality that must form the basis of our approach to the twin issues of enlargement of the EU and the ratification of the Treaty of Nice.</P>
      <P>As I stated in response to questions in the House previously, the Government remains wholly committed to the enlargement process. We recognise that ratification of the Treaty of Nice by the end of 2002 is necessary for enlargement to proceed on schedule. A failure on our part to ratify the treaty would introduce a major obstacle to the enlargement process. It would also have grave consequences for the applicant states, for the Union and, in my view, for our standing in the Union.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have made our position known to our EU partners and to the applicant states. Our partners have made clear their readiness to contribute in every way possible to assisting the Government to find a way forward. They also understand that it is necessary to take time to reflect on the concerns which were expressed by the electorate and to reach conclusions on how to proceed.</P>
      <P>That process of reflection is continuing. I do not expect the matter to arise at Laeken. A key element in the process is the ongoing work of the National Forum on Europe. As the forum continues its deliberations and listens to the views of individuals and organisations from Ireland, from elsewhere in the Union, and from the applicant states, it is promoting serious discussion of many of the issues which arose during the campaign. I hope it will contribute to an improved public understanding of the Union and its activities.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt that many factors contributed to the defeat of the referendum and to the very poor turnout. By no means all of these were directly related to the treaty itself, as is clear from the recent survey conducted on behalf of the European Commission office in Ireland. Unfortunately there was a high degree of uncertainty and confusion regarding the treaty, not helped by those who sought to misrepresent its content and purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government accepts that the text of the treaty cannot be reopened as the conclusions of the Gothenburg European Council confirmed. It may be that there are aspects of the Treaty of Nice, or of the development of the Union gener<Col N="631" /> ally, on which reassurances could be useful. This possibility is one which the Government is bearing in mind, including as we monitor the debate in the National Forum on Europe and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>During my appearance before the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs on 4 December, I set out my views on the current situation in Afghanistan. I welcomed the news that agreement had been reached at the UN-sponsored conference in Bonn. I congratulated the UN Secretary General, Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, and his colleagues on the success of the Bonn conference.</P>
      <P>On 5 December the Afghan parties signed the agreement on a transitional power sharing administration and on arrangements for the reinstatement of permanent Government institutions in Afghanistan. On 6 December the Security Council endorsed the Bonn Agreement in UNSCR 1383 which: called on all Afghan parties to co-operate with the interim administration due to take office on 22 December; reaffirmed support for Ambassador Brahimi and the role entrusted to the UN in Annex ll of the agreement; called on all Afghan parties to allow full humanitarian access in conditions of security, called on international donors to rally to the rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction of Afghanistan; and declared its willingness to take action on the basis of a report by the UN Secretary General, to support the interim institutions, and in due course, to support the implementation of the agreement and its Annexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the general affairs meeting yesterday, the Council gave its full support for the arrangements set out in the agreement signed in Bonn on 5 December. The Council called upon all the Afghan groups to implement the agreement in full and appointed Ambassador Klaus-Peter Klaiber as the EU's Special Representative for Afghanistan, responsible for contributing to the implementation of the Union's policy in that country. He will work in the framework laid down by Security Council Resolution 1378, in close liaison with Special Representative Brahimi, whose action he will support. He is aware of the importance and urgency of an adequate security environment in Kabul and the surrounding area, in particular the possible establishment of an international security force. The member states of the Union are willing to examine what contribution they can make in the framework of the UN Security Council Resolutions. The EU will co-chair the next meeting of the steering <Col N="632" /> group on the Reconstruction of Afghanistan in Brussels on 21 December.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress in the campaign against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. I hope that the fighting can be brought to an early conclusion with the minimum number of casualties.</P>
    <P>With regard to reports of extra judicial killings in Afghanistan, I call on those involved in the fighting to respect international law, particularly in relation to the treatment of prisoners.</P>
    <P>Regarding the events which took place in Mazar-e-Sharif in late November, I stress that, notwithstanding the prevailing conflict situation and the sustained cycle of violence in Afghanistan, it is essential that human rights and humanitarian obligations are respected. It is necessary for the facts of what took place there to be fully established and made known. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights intends to send two field missions to the region to investigate reports. I look forward to their assessment.</P>
    <P>Among the Government's immediate concerns is the necessity for a visible and effective strategy for meeting the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the coming period. Despite the positioning of substantial emergency aid stocks within Afghanistan and on its borders, problems with its distribution to some regions have been exacerbated in recent weeks. One reason for this is the start of winter snowfalls which are making upland areas inaccessible and causing extreme hardship, particularly for vulnerable women and children. Another is the disruption of aid delivery because of conflict along essential routes or infighting between local factions. It is essential that we build on the political consensus reached by the Afghan parties in Bonn to create the secure conditions necessary to deliver aid right now to those who need it. At the same time we can help prepare the way for national reconstruction.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work both bilaterally and with other members of the international donor community in support of these objectives &ndash; including at the forthcoming meeting of the steering group on the Reconstruction of Afghanistan in Brussels on 21 December. This year 5.08 million or £4 million has been provided in humanitarian assistance by Ireland Aid to Afghanistan. This aid is balanced in its delivery between those at risk within the country and those who are seeking protection in neighbouring states such as Pakistan and Iran. It is being provided, in a manner adaptable to the changing situation on the ground, through Irish NGOs such as Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and Christian Aid, and through the appropriate UN and International Red Cross and Crescent agencies. The Government stands ready to provide further relief and recovery assistance to Afghanistan as appropriate to the evolving situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the start of August, following intensive discussions with the parties at Weston Park, the two Governments brought forward a package of proposals to help deliver the full and early implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The package covered all four outstanding issues &ndash; policing, normalisation, stability of the institutions and decommissioning. It said that, while each of the issues is best addressed in its own terms rather than being seen as a precondition for progress on any other, the Agreement can only succeed if all parts of it are implemented together. We repeated our view that decommissioning is an indispensable part of that. In the period since, matters have advanced considerably.</P>
      <P>The Police Service of Northern Ireland has come into being with a policing board which includes representatives of both communities. Further steps have been taken on demilitarisation, including a start to the removal of those military installations identified at Weston Park.</P>
      <P>Having overcome initial difficulties, on 6 November David Trimble and Mark Durkan were elected in the Assembly as First Minister and Deputy First Minister respectively. The institutions are fully back in operation. On 30 November the Taoiseach hosted summit level meetings of both the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council in Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, on 23 October the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported to the Governments that it had witnessed an event, that it regarded as significant, in which the IRA put a quantity of weapons &ndash; arms, ammunition and explosives &ndash; completely beyond use. The commission also said that it would continue its contact with the IRA representative in the pursuit of its mandate. On 3 December the Secretary of State and I met with General de Chastelain when he briefed us on his ongoing work.</P>
      <P>All of this represents substantial progress. It brings us closer than ever before to achieving full implementation of the Agreement. It now needs to be consolidated and advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vision of the Patten report needs to be delivered. I am very pleased that a positive start has been made in this regard. We need arrangements for a fair, balanced, effective and efficient criminal justice system in Northern Ireland put in place. We need to see the institutions carrying out their work in a fully inclusive and stable manner. We need as early a return as possible to a normal security environment and we need all of the guns &ndash; including those held by loyalist paramilitaries &ndash; taken out of the equation. This can best be achieved, not through focus on one issue or through the imposition of deadlines and con<Col N="634" /> ditions, but through a period of sustained calm and stability in which people can see the real benefits of the Agreement delivered.</P>
    <P>The Government, working with the British Government and with the pro-Agreement parties, will continue to do all that it can to ensure that this can happen.</P>

      <P>The report to which the question refers is an International Atomic Energy Agency restricted document which is not in the public domain. It is a report on protection against nuclear terrorism prepared by the Director General of the IAEA and presented by him to the its board of governors' meeting on 30 November. While the report is not in the public domain, a summary of the report was press released by the IAEA on the same date. In summary, the report outlines plans and costings for substantially expanding and strengthening the IAEA's programmes relating to improving nuclear security, including security of nuclear facilities. It also covers emergency response measures. Any decision to publish the report would be a matter for the IAEA and not IAEA member states.</P>

      <P>The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents is designed to respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere which would result in a major release of radioactivity into the environment and pose a radiological hazard in Ireland whether the disaster is caused by an accident or a terrorist attack.</P>
      <P>In summary, the plan shows how accident management will operate; how technical information and radioactivity monitoring data will be collated; how public information will be provided and what measures may be taken for the protection of the public in the short and long-term.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, an exercise to test the national emergency plan took place on 10 November. The consultants engaged by my Department to manage the test have advised that they will report on the outcome of the test around the middle of this month.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to publish the up-dated version of the plan as soon as possible after receipt of the consultants' report. Any appropriate amendments to the plan on foot of the report will be carried out. It is also my intention to distribute to every household a summary of the plan. Preparations are already in hand regarding the design, publication and distribution of the booklet containing the full plan and a separate summary. I expect that the distribution of both these documents will take place as soon as possible in the new year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, and recognising that there is a public need for information on counter measures in the event of a nuclear accident, my Department placed an advertisement in the national and provincial press during the week beginning 11 November. This advertisement outlined basic facts about the effects of a nuclear accident on Ireland and practical precautions which could be taken in the event of such an accident.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at this time to introduce a public service obligation on the Waterford-Dublin air route. I would have any application I might receive for the establishment of such a PSO carefully examined and assessed by my Department. As the Deputy is aware, the EU Commission previously rejected proposals for a PSO route linking Waterford and Dublin on the grounds that the distance involved is relatively short and that the route was adequately served by other transport modes.</P>
      <P>EuroCeltic currently provides daily air services from Waterford to Luton. Last month this air carrier commenced a service from Waterford to Liverpool on Mondays and Fridays. These services are provided by EuroCeltic on a commercial basis in conjunction with assistance from the airport authorities in Waterford. I allocated £200,000 or 253,948 to Waterford Airport this year to support marketing/promotional efforts and safety and security measures at the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contract to provide air services on the Galway/Dublin PSO route and on the PSO routes linking Kerry, Sligo, Knock, and Donegal with <Col N="638" /> Dublin will be subject to a new tender competition in accordance with the provisions of EU Council Regulation 2408/92. At present air services on these routes are provided by Aer Árann under a temporary contract which expires on 30 June 2002. The new formal three year PSO contracts will commence on 1 July 2002.</P>
    <P>I am currently giving urgent consideration to the appropriate specifications to be satisfied by air carriers who wish to participate in the EU tender process covering these five routes, including the Galway-Dublin PSO route. Any revision of the current specifications governing these routes, which were previously published in the <i>EU Official Journal </i>on 15 and 28 September 2000, would have to be published by way of a revised notice in the official journal. This will be followed by publication of notices in the <i>EU Official Journal</i> of invitations to air carriers to tender for the specified PSO services. I expect to be in a position to commence that tender process in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I have not received an offer from the private sector for the purchase of Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have stated on numerous previous occasions that my main concern in relation to whatever strategy is decided upon for Aer Rianta which owns, manages and operates the three State airports, including Shan<Col N="639" /> non Airport, is that it is the correct strategy, not just for the company and its employees, but also for the users of these airports.</P>
    <P>The dreadful events of 11 September in the US have had a dramatic impact on the global aviation industry and particularly on air travel to and from the US. There is now a range of difficulties facing the aviation sector which are being urgently addressed by me, the Government and by governments throughout the world. As the Deputy will appreciate, I am obliged to focus on these priorities at the present time, which include the critical issue of the survival of Aer Lingus, the levels of security at our airports and the Exchequer support for Irish aviation companies in the field of war risk insurance.</P>
    <P>I will return at the appropriate time to consider, in consultation with my Government colleagues, the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta in the long-term.</P>

      <P>The 13th session of the General Assembly of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies took place in Geneva from Wednesday, 7 November to Saturday 10 November.</P>
      <P>Discussions included global public health issues with particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS, emphasis on the role of volunteers in building an effective human and financial resource base and public co-operation and partnerships between national societies and their Governments. This year's statutory meetings did not include an international conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies at which Government nominees attend. The Irish Red Cross Society was represented by the acting secretary general and a senior official from my Department who is a Government nominee to the central council of the society.</P>

The conference is the supreme body of the <Col N="641" /> Red Cross and normally meets every four years. The next meeting is due to be held in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government was represented at the 27th conference and general assembly by the permanent representative of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva and by a senior official of my Department who is a Government nominee on the central council to the Irish Red Cross Society.

      <P>The provision of medical services by the Army medical corps to members of the Defence Forces is limited to the period of their service. Former military personnel have an entitlement as individuals to the normal range of public health services available under the Health Acts.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September an urgent review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities and this review is ongoing. It includes, <i>inter alia</i>, an update of the threat assessment; contact with other State agencies was renewed/undertaken; operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army Ranger Wing, etc., were re-assessed; guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were re-assessed; ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search were re-assessed; and a review of equipment in terms of the need for air defence was undertaken. In this regard the possible acquisition of aircraft to fulfil an air defence role is also a consideration. In addition, my Department is in the process of purchasing several batteries of air defence guns including radars from the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The radar systems will have the capacity to detect overflights by aircraft.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased to meet the changing requirements. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces hold a range of modern NBC equipment, including a total of approximately 1,800 NBC suits. An order for an additional 4,000 NBC suits was placed in July <Col N="643" /> with a delivery date in December 2001/January 2002. In addition, there are approximately 13,500 respirators available to the Defence Forces at present. They also have 50 of the most technologically up to date chemical gas monitors and Defence Forces personnel are currently being trained on these.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing programme of training for personnel as NBC instructors. Recently 19 personnel successfully completed such a course of instruction. A further 19 personnel are currently in training and are due to complete the course on 21 December.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service is the State's principal seagoing agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. It is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. Among this complement of vessels is the <i>LE Róisín</i> which was commissioned into the Naval Service in December 1999 and the <i>LE Niamh</i> which was commissioned in September of this year.</P>
      <P>The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. Fishery protection activity accounts for over 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. As the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.</P>

      <P>The mission of the Defence Forces is to contribute to the security of the State by providing for the military defence of its territorial integrity and to fulfil all roles assigned by Government through the deployment of well motivated and effective Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>This mission was derived following the publication of the White Paper on Defence by the Government in February 2000. The White Paper process included an assessment of both the national and international security environment, resulting in a revision of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government. The restructuring and re-equipment programme of the Defence Forces which is contained in the White Paper is founded on these roles, and will ensure the development of a world class military organisation. The programme has been ongoing since the publication of the White Paper and the result of the Nice Treaty referendum has had no implications in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's role and reputation in the international peacekeeping area can contribute much to the potential for the EU to carry out humanitarian and crisis management missions in support of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Ireland's reputation in peacekeeping and conflict resolution has been, and continues to be, one of <Col N="645" /> which the State can be proud. The Defence Forces, in particular, have represented Ireland for many years through participation in a wide range of United Nations missions throughout the world and have established a reputation well in excess of our proportionate size. In many areas of conflict our military personnel have acquitted themselves well. The Lebanon, former Yugoslavia and East Timor are just some of the areas where Ireland has successfully brought to bear particular skills and experience in the promotion of peace.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed that the result of the Nice Treaty referendum will have implications for Ireland's participation in the European Common Foreign and Security Policy and in the European Security and Defence Policy. The Nice Treaty, which related primarily to institutional arrangements for an enlarged Europe, does not alter in any substantial way the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty in the security and defence area. Ireland's participation in ESDP is fully consistent with the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty as approved by the Irish electorate in May 1998. Based on these provisions the development of ESDP has been elaborated in the conclusions of successive European Councils since Cologne in June 1999. In this regard the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for undertaking humanitarian and crisis management missions known as the Petersberg Tasks. This target known as the headline goal, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, involves the ability to deploy between 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year.</P>
    <P>National sovereignty is an underlying principle to participation in the European Security and Defence Policy. Our Defence Forces will only participate in the Petersberg Tasks authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the <Col N="646" /> Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. The decisions on participation taken by individual member states will subsequently be confirmed through the framework of the EU Council.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the open public debate which is taking place on European issues, through the National Forum on Europe, will help to dispel the fears and anxieties that were expressed in the security and defence area during the referendum campaign.</P>

      <P>The production of sugar in all member states of the European Union is regulated by the EU sugar regime. When Ireland joined the European Communities in 1972 a sugar quota based on traditional sugar production patterns was settled for this country. That quota was specified as an A quota of 182,000 tonnes and a B quota of 18,200 tonnes. The relevant EU regulation specifies that the quota is allocated to the sugar manufacturing concerns on the member states territory. Accordingly, in Ireland's case the quota was made available to Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann Teo., the only manufacturer of sugar here.</P>
      <P>After privatisation in 1991, Irish Sugar plc., a company in the Greencore Group, remained the only manufacturer of sugar in Ireland and the quota continued with that company. The quotas remained unchanged until 2000 when, in compliance with WTO obligations, they were reduced in all member states. In that year Ireland's quota was 178,292.4 tonnes (A) and 17,829.3 tonnes (B). A new sugar regime began on 1 July and the relevant quota is now 181,145.2 tonnes (A) and 18,114.5 tonnes (B).</P>

      <P>The rate of pension payable under the 1994 early retirement scheme is the maximum provided for in the EU Council <Col N="649" /> regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments.</P>
      <P>The rate of pension payable under the scheme that commenced on 27 November 2000 is set down in the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006.

The European Commission rejected this specific proposal but set a fixed rate corresponding to the mid point index between 2000 and 2006.</P>

      <P>By 7 December my Department had received 14,742 applications to join REPS 2. Of these, 12,011 have already been paid and a further 818 have been approved for payment. The remainder, apart from the applications rejected as deficient, will be processed having regard to the payment targets in the protocol on direct payments to farmers. The number of applications received in 2001 is the largest since the first REP scheme was introduced in 1994; the highest number in a previous year was 13,000 in 1996.</P>
      <P>The restrictions on farm visits during the foot and mouth disease emergency meant that REPS planners could not go onto farms to prepare agri-environmental plans for potential applicants. This created a backlog of applications which was compounded by the fact that large numbers of participants in the first scheme came to the end of their contracts this year and would have been expected to apply for the new scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of an enhanced approach to seeking to eradicate scrapie from the national flock, my Department has decided to depopulate flocks of sheep which have had a case of scrapie since 1 January 1999 and which have been movement restricted by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Department was approached by the IFA on behalf of the flockowners in question with a view to entering into discussions on a compensation package for those concerned. Pursuant to these initial contacts my Department has had a series of meetings with the IFA, at which a number of the flockowners concerned were also present, to progress the matter. It was pointed out by my Department that the compensation measures which were contemplated constitute a State aid and as such require the necessary European Commission clearance. It was also pointed out that a key element of the Commission's determination would be whether it considered as objectively reasonable the compensation offered.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the IFA dated 27 November, following meetings on 17 and 21 November, my Department made an offer of compensation via the IFA to affected flockowners. The letter of 27 November superseded and corrected an earlier letter of 22 November containing a typographical error which was identified as such and drawn to the specific attention of the IFA by my Department within a matter of hours of its issue. The Department advised the IFA that the letter of 27 November should be regarded as the definitive statement of the position. It is surprising that the IFA spokespersons persisted in public statements in seeking to rely on the erroneous element of the letter of 22 November in the full knowledge that it was an error and did not represent my Department's position on the point at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offer made by the Department to the affected flockowners included provision for the valuation and purchase of the flocks and for income support for up to three years after depopulation, and included a number of other elements. The offer in relation to the market value of the flocks substantially mirrored the IFA's proposals with a minor reduction in the valuation of hoggets. For the past number of weeks the IFA has persisted in demands to have all female animals of more than 37 kg live weight treated as ewes in lamb for the purposes of mar<Col N="651" /> ket valuation of each flock to be depopulated. This is something which was never agreed by my Department at any stage. On the contrary, my Department's position is that the treatment for market valuation purposes of all animals up to 55 kg had been settled at the meeting with the IFA on 17 November, on the basis of proposals made by the IFA.</P>
    <P>A further meeting with the IFA was held on Friday, 7 December. This meeting was held in the context of a rejection by the IFA of an offer by my Department to employ scanning as a mechanism for determining pregnancy and of my Department's insistence that there is not, and never was, any question of simply deeming female animals above 37 kg live weight to be in effect ewes in lamb for market valuation purposes. My Department made it clear at the outset that it is not prepared to reopen or renegotiate aspects of the offer which had already been settled. It was acknowledged that given respective positions clarification was required on the approach which would be employed for determining relevant animals to be ewes in lamb thus attracting a market value of £133. A formula emerged from the meeting under which percentages generated by historical research undertaken by Teagasc would be applied.</P>
    <P>A letter reflecting the outcome to the meeting on Friday last and reiterating the elements of the compensation package on offer to flockowners was issued by the Department yesterday. The package is available to those flockowners who by midday on Friday next, 14 December, accept the terms of the offer.</P>
    <P>I reject the suggestion that my Department has in any way reneged on or varied understandings or agreements made with the IFA on behalf of flockowners. I am satisfied that my Department has dealt fairly and honourably with this issue throughout. The current package is a good one for those concerned and I urge them to accept it. Once flockowners signify their acceptance of the package my Department will move with all possible speed to begin the process of depopulating the flocks in question. There is no justification for any further delay on this issue and that continued adherence to clearly unreasonable demands can only work to the detriment of the flockowners concerned.</P>

      <P>The person named leased 33 acres of land with milk quota attached from 1 April 1995 to 31 March to two other producers. The leased land was also included on his area aid applications for the years 1995 to 1999, <Col N="652" /> inclusive, in contravention of the area aid terms and conditions. The resultant penalty is that he is not entitled to any area aid related grants. As he was paid a total of £30,520.81 in grants under the cattle headage, suckler cow premium and extensification premium schemes for the years in question, these grants stand to be repaid to my Department or recovered from any grants due on foot of other aid applications, including the area based compensatory allowance scheme. He was written to in the matter on 25 May 2000, 11 September and 11 October. A reply was received on 20 October and is being considered at present.

      <P>The person named was paid £778.48, representing an entitlement of £1059.79, less overpayment of £281.30 under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme on 25 September in respect of 23.55 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. This compares with his average payment of £1037.20 under the old animal based headage schemes in the three years 1998 to 2000, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. In designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be given to certain natural bound<Col N="653" /> aries, such as rivers and roads, and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
    <P>Following a thorough review of the area based compensatory allowance scheme proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

      <P>The procedure for disposing of reactor animals under the TB and brucellosis disease eradication schemes operates on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals. My Department selects the meat factories which are most financially beneficial to farmers in the prices that they offer for different types of animals.</P>
      <P>The compensation for reactor animals comprises of the salvage value of the animal which is paid by the factory directly to the farmer and of a reactor grant, or live valuation less the salvage value, paid to the farmer by my Department.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that at all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer. Therefore, the contract for the salvage value is a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate compensation.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as has happened in the case in question, the recovery of any moneys due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between themselves and the company's liquidators.</P>

      <Quest>the reason considerable tracks of arable land have been designated mountain type; the long-term implications for stocking density on these lands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997 a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. In designating the areas concerned on the LPI system regard had to be given to certain natural boundaries, such as rivers and roads, and it was <Col N="658" /> not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare, subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>
      <P>At present it is difficult to assess the long-term implications for stocking density on land designated as mountain type. The adoption of commonage framework plans in 2002 will have an impact on certain mountain type commonage land.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid £1,517.00 on 26 October under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 33.71 hectares of mountain type land. His average headage payment in the years 1998 to 2000, inclusive, was £3,585.24. Under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area based scheme were to be paid an additional sum equal to 90% of the difference between the average headage payment and the amount payable under the scheme. Because of the reduction in area of the holding of the person named from 48.06 hectares in 2000 to 33.71 in 2001, the compensation element of the area based scheme was not included in the basic payment. In such cases the intention is to make a compensatory payment which takes into account the fact that the overall forage area has decreased in 2001. The person named will be paid such compensation as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of an enhanced approach to seeking to eradicate scrapie from the national flock, my Department has decided to depopulate flocks of sheep which have had a case of scrapie since 1 January 1999 and which had their movement restricted by the Department.</P>
      <P>The persons referred to are the owners of one of the affected flocks. The Department was approached by the IFA on their behalf, and on behalf of other flockowners in a similar position, with a view to entering into discussions on a compensation package for those concerned. Pursuant to these initial contacts my Department has had a series of meetings with the IFA, at which a number of the flockowners concerned were also present, to progress the matter. It was pointed out by my Department that the compensation measures which were contemplated constitute a State aid and as such require the necessary European Commission clearance. It was also pointed out that a key element of the Commission's determination would be whether it considered as objectively reasonable the compensation offered.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the IFA dated 27 November, following meetings on 17 and 21 November, my Department made an offer of compensation via the IFA to affected flockowners. The letter dated 27 November superseded and corrected an earlier letter dated 22 November containing a typographical error which was identified as such and drawn to the specific attention of the IFA by my Department within a matter of hours of its issue. My Department advised the IFA that the letter dated 27 November should be regarded as the definitive statement of the position. It is surprising that the IFA spokespersons persisted in public statements in seeking to rely on the erroneous element of the letter dated 22 November in the full knowledge that it was an error and did not represent my Department's position on the points at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offer made by my Department to the affected flockowners included provision for the valuation and purchase of the flocks and for income support for up to three years after depopulation. It also included a number of other elements. The offer, in relation to the market value of the flocks, substantially mirrored the IFA's proposals with a minor reduction in the valuation of hoggets. For the past number of weeks the IFA has persisted in demands to have all female animals of more than 37 kg live weight treated as ewes in lamb for the purposes of market valuation of each flock to be depopulated. <Col N="662" /> This is something which was never agreed to by my Department at any stage. On the contrary, my Department's position is that the treatment for market valuation purposes of all animals up to 55 kg had been settled at the meeting with the IFA on 17 November.</P>
    <P>A further meeting with the IFA was held on Friday, 7 December. This meeting was held in the context of a rejection by the IFA of an offer by my Department to employ scanning as a mechanism for determining pregnancy and of my Department's insistence that there is not, and never was, any question of simply deeming female animals above 37 kg live weight to be in effect ewes in lamb for market valuation purposes. At the outset my Department made it clear that it is not prepared to reopen or renegotiate aspects of the offer which had already been settled. It was acknowledged that, given respective positions, clarification was required on the approach which would be employed for determining relevant animals to be ewes in lamb thus attracting a market value of £133. A formula emerged from the meeting under which percentages generated by historical research undertaken by Teagasc would be applied.</P>
    <P>A letter reflecting the outcome to the meeting on Friday last, and reiterating the elements of the compensation package on offer to flockowners, was issued by my Department yesterday. Under the terms of the offer particular arrangements will be made to cater for pedigree flocks, such as that owned by the persons to whom the Deputy has referred. The package is available to those flockowners who by midday on Friday next, 14 December, accept the terms of the offer.</P>
    <P>I reject the suggestion that my Department has in any way reneged on understandings or agreements made with the IFA on behalf of flockowners. I am satisfied that my Department has dealt fairly and honourably with this issue throughout. The current package is a good one for those concerned and I urge them to accept it. Once flockowners signify their acceptance of the package my Department will move with all possible speed to begin the process of depopulating the flocks in question. There is no justification for any further delay on this issue and continued adherence to clearly unreasonable demands can only work to the detriment of the flockowners concerned.</P>

      <P>The animal concerned was found, on its arrival at the meat factory, to be missing an eartag. The tagging of bovine animals is a very important element of animal identification for traceability within the food chain. Under the provisions of the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order, 1996 (S.I.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The realisation of new markets and outlets for Irish food produce is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The role of An Bord Bia is to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish food and livestock and is not to acquire contracts etc.</P>
      <P>The future development of the food industry is dependent on its ability to remain competitive in an increasingly challenging environment. The Government, in recognition of this fact, has provided funding of £48 million under the food marketing initiatives of the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006. This funding will be administered by An Bord Bia and is intended to enhance the competitiveness and innovative capabilities of the industry. Part of the funding will be used towards the marketing finance programme which is designed to assist small companies in developing their marketing capabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operating under the brand name &ldquo;Ireland the Food Island&rdquo; An Bord Bia has sought to ensure continued market access and exploit new market opportunities by developing the most profitable and reliable route to the market. For example, An Bord Bia has developed a common identity for Irish beef which has been rolled out across all supermarkets in Britain and which is also being tested in other markets. This means that for the first time ever, Irish beef can be identified at consumer level in these multiples, thus creating the <Col N="664" /> opportunity for repeat purchases. Exports of Irish beef will reach 335,000 tonnes this year. Exports of beef to Russia have increased this year compared to last and An Bord Bia has played an important supporting role in the re-opening of the Egyptian market.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has positioned itself to anticipate significant emerging international trends so that it can continue to play a leading role in the development of the Irish food and drinks industry and works closely with producers, processors and customers to implement a wide range of activities in target markets.</P>

      <P>On 7 October I announced that the Egyptian authorities had that day published a decree to extend the existing European wide ban on beef imports but, in a major development, the decree provided for an exemption for countries with BSE controls of the type operated by Ireland. The decree relates specifically to beef and not to live cattle.</P>
      <P>The Egyptian veterinary requirement is for two year old animals, with age determined by routine dentition checks. The question of competing for contracts is a commercial matter for the exporters involved. Now that the import ban has been removed in so far as Ireland is concerned, I am, naturally, hopeful that Irish companies will compete to regain the level of market share they enjoyed in recent years in this important market.</P>

      <Quest>if, in the case of cohabiting couples, tax free allowances can be transferred to the other partner in the case of one partner becoming unemployed due to the fact that each partner's income is recognised and assessed as means in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance payments.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit is that each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons. Consequently, as each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes, credits and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer tax credit. The latter credit was introduced in the Finance Act, 2000 in respect of those spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons. It may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed for tax and where one spouse, the home carer, cares for one or more dependant persons. The home carer credit cannot be claimed by cohabiting couples, as individuals who are not married cannot opt for joint assessment.</P>
      <P>I initiated in budget 2000 the process of widening the standard rate income tax band. When the process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band. Every income earner will have his or her own non-transferable standard rate tax band regardless of marital status.</P>
      <P>The issue of the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was examined in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999 &ndash; the report is available from the Government Publications Office. The group was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group acknowledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead <Col N="668" /> of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the married person's tax credit to such couples at present.</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;dependent relative&rdquo; was broadened in this year's Finance Act so that the following are now dependent relatives for the purposes of claiming health expenses relief: (i) a relative of the individual, or of the individual's spouse, who is incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself; (ii) the widowed father or widowed mother of the individual or of the individual's spouse, whether incapacitated or not, or (iii) a son or daughter of the individual who resides with the individual and on whose services the individual, by reason of old age or infirmity, is compelled to depend.

      <P>It is assumed that the &ldquo;9% stamp duty&rdquo; referred to in the Deputy's question is the flat rate of stamp duty which was applicable to investors buying second hand residential property prior to 6 December 2001. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000 introduced a flat 9% rate of stamp duty for residential property bought by investors. From 27 February 2001 relief from the 9% rate was introduced for investors purchasing new residential property.</P>
      <P>In Budget 2002, on 5 December 2001, I introduced changes to the stamp duty rates payable by investors in both new and second-hand residential property. From 6 December 2001, purchasers of such properties will pay the same rates as already paid by owner occupiers who purchase second-hand property. For ease of reference the rates now applicable to second-hand residential property are the following:</P>

    <P>In an equity release situation, the reversionary interest referred to by the Deputy is normally purchased by a company-individual from an elderly resident who continues to live in the property for the remainder of his-her life. It is this company-individual who is liable to pay the stamp duty arising on this type of purchase &ndash; and not the elderly resident. Stamp duty is chargeable on the amount of the consideration paid by the company-individual to the elderly resident which would represent the value of the equity which has been released.</P>
    <P>As a result of the changes that I announced in my budget speech last week, the Deputy will see from the table provided above that there are now only two rate structures applying to second-hand residential property purchased on or after 6 December 2001. There is the reduced rate structure for first time buyers who must comply with certain conditions and the full rate structure which applies to both other owner occupiers and investors.</P>
    <P>As a result of the budget, the rate of stamp duty applicable to reversionary interest purchases <Col N="671" /> under £500,000, 635,000, has been effectively reduced from the previous flat 9% to a range varying between nil and 7.5%. Moreover, in the event that the purchaser was a relative of the elderly resident, the purchase would attract stamp duty at half the appropriate rate otherwise applicable.</P>

      <P>By virtue of the nature of policing, it is not possible to estimate with precision the costs of Garda overtime attributable to activity associated with the outbreak of civil strife in Northern Ireland. However, approximately 1% of the Garda overtime budget was expended on Border security to date this year &ndash; excluding expenditure incurred in relation to the control of foot and mouth disease. It is estimated that this will cost some £630,000 in 2001.</P>
      <P>Based on 65 subversives being held in prison on 17 October 2001, the approximate cost of holding such prisoners to 17 October 2001 was £7.112 million, 9.03 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to promote lifetime transfers of land and encourage more young people to pursue farming there is full relief from stamp duty on the transfer of land to a young trained farmer under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for three years until 31 December 2002.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the relief a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; is one who: (i) is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer; (ii) is the holder of one of the specified qualifications e.g. the Teagasc certificate in farming; or (iii) if born before 1 January 1968, has three years' experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours' duration.</P>
      <P>Where the transferee has completed at least one academic year of the Teagasc certificate in farming at the date of execution of the transfer, he-she may obtain the relief by way of a refund provided that the qualification is obtained within three years of the date of execution of the transfer.</P>
      <P>There is provision in legislation for 90% relief from capital acquisitions tax, CAT, in respect of gifts and inheritances of certain agricultural property. The latter may include agricultural land, farmhouses, farm buildings, farm machinery and bloodstock. The relief is not restricted to, but would include, young qualifying farmers. To avail of the relief, 80% of his/her gross property must &ndash; after the taking of the gift &ndash; comprise agricultural property, livestock, bloodstock and farm machinery.</P>
      <P>Where the donee has taken no prior gifts or inheritances from either or both of his/her parents since 5 December 1991 and is receiving a gift of agricultural land from parents, he/she may also avail of the group 1 exempt threshold which applies where the donee is a child of the disponer(s). This amount is currently £316,800. Therefore, a child can take a benefit of £3,168,000 in qualifying assets from a parent(s) free of CAT, that is, 90% relief worth £2,851,200 plus the balance of 10% or £316,800 which is covered by the threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain full-time farmers can avail of income averaging where, instead of being charged tax on their farming profits in the normal way, that is, on the profits of a 12 month period ending in the year of assessment, a farmer may elect to be <Col N="674" /> charged on the basis of the average of the aggregate farming profits and losses of the three years ending in the year of assessment. In effect, one-third of the profits for the three years is charged for a year. Farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession or who are directors of companies which carry on a trade or profession cannot elect for income averaging. An exception is provided for in the case of the provision of farmhouse holidays. Once an election for averaging is made, a farmer must remain on averaging for a minimum of three years. If the farmer wishes to revert to the normal basis of assessment, the two years of assessment immediately before the final year of averaging are reviewed and, if necessary, additional assessments are made to ensure that the amount charged for each of those two years is not less than the amount charged for the final year of averaging.</P>
    <P>Farmers can also avail of a scheme of capital allowances for the purchase of a milk quota under the national quota restructuring scheme which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development introduced from 1 April 2000. The allowances apply to milk quota purchased from co-operatives or dairies as well as in the case of certain milk quota purchased directly from lessors by lessees not connected to that lessor who are currently leasing that quota. The allowances are granted on a straight line basis over a seven year period. The allowances apply to expenditure incurred on or after 6 April 2000 on the purchase of qualifying quota. Where a milk quota is subsequently sold or disposed of the normal balancing allowance or charge provisions will apply. Following completion of consultations with the European Commission a ministerial order was recently signed which activated the commencement of these provisions. In the course of these consultations the Commission indicated to the Irish authorities that it considered the relief to be compatible with their State aid guidelines, subject to the relief being extended to all purchases of milk quota by producers in the State. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the relief in the forthcoming Finance Bill so to include the purchase of all milk quota by producers subject to a cap on the amount of relief payable equal to the maximum of the price fixed by the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development under Article 8(f2&gt;b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92 &ndash; the restructuring scheme &ndash; in respect of the quota year in which the transfer of quota takes place.</P>
    <P>Persons chargeable to tax on their farming profits may claim a farm buildings allowance for capital expenditure on the construction of farm buildings, other than buildings used as a dwelling, and certain other works, such as fences, roadways, holding yards, drains, land reclamation and other works such as walls, water and electrical installation and sewerage. The cost is written off at the rate of 15% of the cost in each of the first six years with the remaining 10% in year seven.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> Farmers may also avail of a special scheme of capital allowances for farm pollution control where qualifying expenditure on necessary measures has been incurred. This scheme, which was introduced in the Finance Act, 1997, originally applied for three years, from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000. It provided for a special year one allowance limit of 50% of expenditure incurred or £15,000, that is, 50% of £30,000, whichever is the lesser. The rest of the expenditure can be written down over seven years giving a total write down period of eight years. The 2000 Finance Act made a number of changes to the scheme. First, it extended the scheme for a further three years to 5 April 2003. Second, for expenditure incurred on or after 6 April 2000, it reduced the writing down period from eight to seven years. Third, it also increased the limit to the lesser of 50% of the expenditure or £25,000, that is, 50% of £50,000. Finally, it converted the year one allowance into a floating allowance to be taken in whole or in part at any time over the writing down period.</P>
    <P>Farmers who dispose of livestock under a disease eradication scheme can opt for a special tax treatment of profits which arise from the compulsory disposal of livestock as provided for under section 668 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This section provides for the deferral of such profits in two equal instalments, either in the year of disposal and the following year or the two years after the year of disposal. In addition, farmers who restock their herds during the deferral period qualify for 100% stock relief, instead of the usual 25% in respect of the replacement livestock. This 100% stock relief is subject to a cap, which is equal to the amount of the profits made by farmers as a result of the compulsory disposal. Such profits are as a result of the difference between the book value of the disposed livestock at the start of the accounting period and the amount of the compensation paid under the various disease eradication schemes. The effect of both the profit deferral and the special 100% stock relief is that farmers affected by the compulsory eradication schemes are not taxed on what is in effect a paper profit and can restock their herds without incurring an additional tax liability as a result of the compensation received. In my recent budget speech, I announced that the current two year period during which farmers can opt to defer book profits that have arisen from compensation received in respect of the compulsory disposal of livestock under a statutory disease eradication scheme will be extended to four years. The corresponding two year restocking period during which such farmers can qualify for 100% stock relief is also to be extended to four years.</P>
    <P>Tax relief is also provided for in respect of the increase in value of livestock and other stock such as fertiliser etc. This relief is available at 25% to farmers in general and at an enhanced rate of 100% to certain young trained farmers. This relief was extended until 31 December 2002 in the 2001 <Col N="676" /> Finance Act, subject to the signing of a commencement order. My Department is currently examining this relief in the context of the European Commission's new guidelines on state aid to the agriculture sector and the orders can be signed when my Department has confirmed that the reliefs adhere to these guidelines.</P>
    <P>Farmers can also avail of the general five year write off period, that is, 20% per annum, for capital allowances for plant and machinery, which was introduced in the 2001 budget.</P>

I am advised by the Department of Education and Science that the number of places taken up by new students in these colleges during the period 1996 to the current academic year was as follows:</P>

    <P>It is, therefore, inaccurate to suggest that there has been a drop off in the number of students opting to take medicine: the number of places has in fact grown by 15.6% since 1996-97.</P>
    <P>In relation to our medical schools the annual intake to undergraduate medical programmes is the subject of a quota, which was introduced in 1980/81 following a report of the Higher Education Authority. The question of reviewing the quota arrangement is under consideration. In this context, as the Deputy is aware, the Government decided earlier this year to establish a national task force on medical manpower. One of the project groups, which will report to the steering group of the task force, will specifically deal with medical education and training. This project group will look at developing structures for medical education, training and flexible working <Col N="678" /> arrangements in the most effective and efficient way possible, and will,<i> inter alia</i>, address the question of the appropriate number of places needed in future years to meet the medical workforce planning requirements identified by the task force.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of students dropping out of courses, I am advised by the Department of Education and Science that the most recent research regarding completion rates for undergraduate university courses relates to the cohort of students who entered third level courses in the 1992/93 academic year. A study of non-completion in undergraduate university courses was undertaken by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, at the request of the Higher Education Authority and published earlier this year. The study found that non-completion rates for first time entrants to undergraduate university courses in medicine in the 1992/93 academic year was very low: 5.7%, as against an average for all courses of 16.8%, with drop-out rates in individual universities ranging from 1.9% to 9.1%.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available, therefore, it would be premature to speak of a looming crisis in general practice. However, I will ask the national task force on medical manpower to consider the need for further research in this area and, should evidence emerge of an escalation in drop-out rates, to consider the implications and make appropriate recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government's national children's strategy was launched by the Taoiseach last year. It maps out a plan to be implemented over the next ten years, which will provide a better way for everybody who is concerned with children's issues to work more effectively together for children and with children and their families.</P>
      <P>During the development of the national children's strategy, careful consideration was given to the structures necessary to best implement the strategy. This involved consideration of the role of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and how to ensure better co-ordination between Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> Children's issues impinge significantly on the work of many Departments and this is reflected in the 11 Departments represented through the new structures. It was clear that bringing all children's services together in a single Department would have been impossible and would have created a totally unwieldy and ineffective body.</P>
    <P>The following new structures which have now been put in place reflect the primary need, which is for effective co-ordination between Departments. A Cabinet Committee on Children has been set up. The first meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Children, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, took place on 28 March 2001, the committee meets on a quarterly basis to review progress in implementing the strategy and to agree priorities for action. A broader role has been assigned to the Minister of State with responsibility for children. As Minister of State, I am now responsible for overseeing the implementation of the strategy and co-ordinating Government policy on children in order to maintain the policy coherence achieved through the publication of the strategy. This is in addition to my current statutory role in the Department of Health and Children. I report to the Cabinet committee on progress. A National Children's Office has been established. The office provides a dedicated team to support me as Minister of State in my expanded role. While Departments retain responsibility for implementing the strategy, the office co-ordinates and monitors progress in this regard. The office is now taking the lead role in a number of key policy areas. These include co-ordinating the implementation of the Children Act, 2001 and developing a national play and recreation policy. A National Children's Advisory Council has been established. The inaugural meeting of the National Children's Advisory Council took place on 15 May 2001. The council, which has 30 members, has an independent advisory role in relation to the implementation of the strategy, reporting to me as Minister of State. The functions of the council were set out in the national children's strategy. The council will maintain the partnership approach developed through the strategy to influencing policy on children's issues. It includes representatives of the statutory agencies, voluntary sector, research community, parents and children. At the first meeting of the council, I proposed two priority areas to be addressed &ndash; the voice of children and play and recreation. These areas were agreed by the council and working groups have been established to address them.</P>
    <P>As previously stated, individual Departments and their respective agencies will carry the main responsibility for implementing the strategy. In this regard, Departments will participate with the National Children's Office, in the preparation and implementation of detailed action plans which will give effect to the national goals of the strategy. The children's office will also review the <Col N="680" /> current distribution of responsibilities for children's policy across Departments. Recommendations for the rationalisation of functions of Departments, which may arise from this review, will be brought to the Cabinet committee. The new arrangements are now operational and working well.</P>

The unions are currently considering proposals which were made by the board at a recent meeting. If these proposals are accepted, the Western Health Board will be in a position to fund their implementation from within its existing financial resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179, 226 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>The capitation rate now being paid to doctors in respect of their eligible patients aged 70 years and over from 1 July 2001 reflects a negotiated figure agreed between the Irish Medical Organisation and my Department through the HSEA.</P>
      <P>Recent information provided to my Department by the health boards and given in an answer last week reported that the number of medical card applications for this category of patient now stands at 67,575. It will now be necessary to validate the current information and I will revert to the Deputy when this has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> The calculations of costs associated with the implementation of the budget provision were, as I stated previously, originally based on the figures available from the Central Statistics Office for the total number of persons in that age category and the information available from the GMS Payments Board as to the number of persons who currently held a medical card.</P>
    <P>On the question of the underpayment of moneys due to general practitioners, I am assured by the GMS Payments Board that doctors who have been issued with contracts by their health boards are being paid for their services. There may be some doctors who await the necessary qualification certification before their claims can be processed and these doctors have not been receiving payment for services provided to persons aged 70 years and over. A meeting was held on Friday last on this subject, at which my Department was represented, with the Medical Council, Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
    <P>Persons aged 70 years and over are eligible for a medical card regardless of means. Persons in other age groups should apply in the normal way and have their application assessed primarily on means but with other relevant factors also taken into account in the determination of their eligibility.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council has informed me that the fitness to practise committee of the Medical Council conducted an inquiry into the professional conduct of the doctor in question pursuant to the provisions of Part V of the Medical Practitioners' Act, 1978. I understand that the committee completed its report at the end of November 2001. A copy of the report has been furnished to the legal advisers for the doctor in question and the registrar of the Medical Council. The report is also in the process of being issued to the members of the Medical Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Medical Council that, on foot of receipt of the report, the legal advisers for the registrar, on his instructions, immediately wrote to the chairman of the inquiry committee drawing attention to the strong representations which had been received from the complainants for sight of the report and in effect seeking a sitting of the committee at which this aspect of the matter could be addressed by both the legal teams for the doctor and the registrar and at which the complainants would be in attendance. <Col N="683" /> Such a sitting is being arranged for later this week.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have been advised by the Medical Council that the position of the complainants on being given access to the report of the fitness to practise committee, following the inquiry held into the doctor in question, has not been denied and will be determined at the forthcoming hearing before the fitness to practise committee, at which the complainants may be present.</P>

The training grant scheme for non-consultant hospital doctors has been applied successfully throughout the public hospital system to those non-consultant hospital doctors who qualify for the grant.</P>
      <P>The eligibility for the payment of the training grant to NCHDs is agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation. Some delays have been experienced where individual NCHDs have not followed the normal procedure in the health service for accessing payments of grants.</P>
      <P>To access this grant, the staff members should first request their head of department to assess the appropriateness of the course, seminar etc. and recommend the course, seminar etc, as suitable for funding under the training grant. The recommendation is submitted to the appropriate hospital manager for approval. Where this procedure is followed, delays should not occur as prior approval for expenditure has been granted.</P>
      <P>The scope of this grant has been widened since its inception to encompass research registrars and has been extended to facilitate the purchase of laptop computers for NCHDs. The grant has been enthusiastically received and utilised by NCHDs to attend courses and conferences recommended by their supervising consultant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 188 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a very strict regulatory regime which is designed to ensure only competent, properly qualified medical practitioners can work in this country. No doctor is allowed to practice medicine in Ireland unless he or she is registered on the register of medical practitioners. The overriding rationale behind these requirements is to ensure the protection of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council is the independent body charged with regulating medical registration. When this issue surrounding the appointment in 2000 of a <Col N="686" /> locum consultant psychiatrist by the South-Eastern Health Board was brought to my attention, I immediately made arrangements to meet the Medical Council and the board.</P>
    <P>Following the briefings by the South-Eastern Health Board and the Medical Council, I decided to appoint an independent person, Ms Maureen Lynott, to review the circumstances surrounding the case with a view to establishing whether and how procedures or regulations may be improved.</P>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has informed me that it employed the named doctor in a locum capacity from 17 April 2000 until 5 November 2000. He was employed at St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital, Clonmel until 31 July and from 14 August at St. Canice's Psychiatric Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that the temporary appointment was made following the board's advertisement of the post and in accordance with the board's recruitment procedures. The South-Eastern Health Board has informed me that it did not receive any complaints regarding the named doctor during the period of his employment with the board. The board has established a help line for patients who may have concerns in relation to their contact with this doctor.</P>
    <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that it is the intention of my Department, the health board and Medical Council to ensure the protection of patients and to promote confidence in the health service and we are all taking steps to ensure that these aims are met. In this context, I have been advised that the Medical Council has obtained an order from the High Court suspending the doctor in question from the General Register of Medical Practitioners from 13 November 2001, pending the outcome of an inquiry by the Council's fitness to practise committee early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not sta<Col N="691" /> tutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>
    <P>The strategy sets out a blueprint for ambitious and wide ranging change across the whole health system over the next seven to ten years and is underlined by a set of comprehensive targets. In setting out such a comprehensive and large-scale plan, it is inevitable that prioritising of actions must take place. The strategy represents a clear plan for moving forward which is based on a step-by-step approach to reducing inequalities in the system and building the necessary capacity to meet the growing needs of the population. This Government has now set out a comprehensive programme for delivering high-class and accessible health care for all.</P>
    <P>Equity in health care is about a full range of services and supports and goes well beyond the issue of income guidelines for medical cards. It is a core principle on which the strategy is based and one which this Government is committed to addressing in the implementation of the strategy and through service developments across the board. The overriding necessity in relation to equity is the need for access to services.</P>
    <P>Services have to be built up, waiting lists reduced, activity increased and specific groups such as children and those with disabilities require targeted service developments if equity is to be served in a meaningful way. A broad strategic focus is essential to deal with these sort of problems and no single narrow approach will address the real need for better more equitable health care services for all. I have already stated that in 2002, the Government's priorities for improving the health system will be: 650 additional acute hospital beds; addressing waiting lists through a new treatment purchase fund; commencing implementation of the new model of primary care; services for people with a disability; and services for older people.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make funding directly available to a school (details supplied) in County Limerick to recruit a full-time speech and language therapist without the assistance of the local health board; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this has been done successfully in a school for children with special needs in Ennis, County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision of speech and language therapy to schools in Counties Limerick and Clare is a matter in the first instance for the Mid-Western Health Board. I have been informed by the board that speech and language therapy to schools is provided as part of the speech and language therapy service to children. This service is provided directly by the board or through the voluntary agencies who are contracted by the health board.</P>
      <P>The health board funds the Clare Federation for the Mentally Handicapped to provide certain services in County Clare. Part of this service includes the provision of speech and language therapy services for two special schools, St. Anne's and St. Clare's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> Due to the nationwide shortage of speech and language therapists, the Mid-Western Health Board has a number of vacancies, including the post in the school in County Limerick which the Deputy mentions. This has a significant impact on the board's ability to provide speech and language therapy services to children including those attending special schools. Every effort has been made to fill this and other posts in the area, both nationally and in the UK. The recruitment campaigns have been unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July last. The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. Other key recommendations of the report include: the provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; the need for concerted recruitment from overseas; the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

      <P>In 1994 my Department produced a health services waste policy aimed at reducing the impact on the environment of waste arising in the public health service and improving conditions for those handling the waste. The policy set out basic principles relating to the generation and management of waste. This included the segregation of waste into domestic type waste and the potentially hazardous fraction known as health care risk waste. A strategy of using non-incineration, shredding and decontamination technology has been pursued for the health care risk waste.</P>
      <P>Health care risk waste from virtually all publicly funded health care agencies is now disposed of through a national contract. The contract specification covers the collection, treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste to the highest environmental and health and safety standards.</P>
      <P>The waste is processed in a shredding and disinfection plant which operates under an Environmental Protection Agency licence. The sterilised residue is disposed of to a licensed commercial landfill site under strict conditions. The non-risk waste follows the disposal route of municipal or commercial waste to authorised landfills.</P>
      <P>Guidance on the proper segregation and handling of health care waste was issued by the Department to health boards and major acute hospitals in 1999.</P>

      <P>Services at St. James's Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to examine this matter and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has decided in the context of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. A total of 650 additional beds will be in place by the end of 2002, including 450 beds in public hospitals. The distribution of these beds is being finalised by my Department in consultation with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

    <P>The issue of the verification of the numbers of actual asylum seekers on a general practitioner's panel proved very difficult and this was preventing payment being made to the doctors. However, in an attempt to address the problem and to honour the Department's agreement with the IMO, it has been agreed that an interim pay<Col N="700" /> ment will be made to doctors providing services to asylum seekers. These interim payments, if they have been approved by the health boards and submitted in time to the GMS (Payments) Board, will be paid before Christmas.</P>

      <P>In 1994 my Department produced a health services waste policy aimed at reducing the impact on the environment of waste arising in the public health service and improving conditions for those handling the waste. The policy set out basic principles relating to the generation and management of waste. This included the segregation of waste into domestic type waste and the potentially hazardous fraction known as health care risk waste. A strategy of using non-incineration, shredding and decontamination technology has been pursued for the health care risk waste.</P>
      <P>Health care risk waste from virtually all publicly funded health care agencies is now disposed of through a national contract. The contract specification covers the collection, treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste to the highest environmental and health and safety standards.</P>
      <P>The waste is processed in a shredding and disinfection plant which operates under an Environmental Protection Agency licence. The sterilised residue is disposed of to a licensed commercial landfill site under strict conditions. The non-risk waste follows the disposal route of municipal or commercial waste to authorised landfills.</P>
      <P>Guidance on the proper segregation and handling of health care waste was issued by the Department to health boards and major acute hospitals in 1999.</P>

      <P>The Dental Council established and maintains a Register of Dental Specialists in Orthodontics in exercise of its powers under the Dentists Act, 1985. In this context, it has recognised the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry as a body within the State to advise it on the granting of evidence of satisfactory completion of specialist training. This committee fulfils its role through its Specialist Advisory Committee, SAC, in orthodontics.</P>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of this register of dental specialists, specialist training in Ireland was approved by the SAC of the UK based Joint Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry. This committee is representative of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and Great Britain. In 1999, the SAC approved the provision of 12 places for trainees involved in the specialist dentist in orthodontics training programme of the Dublin Dental School and Hospital.</P>
      <P>Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training in October last for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. In addition, my Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty; he is currently liaising with the two dental schools in Dublin and Cork and the consultant orthodontists of the regional orthodontic units in the health boards on the provision conjointly of specialist training programmes in 2002. In this regard, the Dublin Dental School and Hospital intends providing specialist training in orthodontics for an additional six trainees from the health boards in 2002, subject to the requirements laid down by the Specialist Advisory Committee on orthodontic consultant staffing.</P>
      <P>Three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training for these health boards to nine.</P>
      <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million, 1.27 million, was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>

      <P>The funding of the Dental School and Hospital is provided by the Department of Education and Science in respect of direct education costs associated with the teaching and training of undergraduate dental students, postgraduate students undertaking higher degrees by research, postgraduate students undertaking specialist training courses, dental auxiliaries, including dental hygiene, dental technology and dental nursing, those undertaking higher training to consultant level and the provision of continuing education courses for dentists and auxiliary dental staff.</P>
      <P>All other costs of funding the Dental School and Hospital over and above the direct education costs are shared equally between the Department of Education and Science and my Department.</P>
      <P>Through the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, the total funding provided by my Department to the Dental School and Hospital in 2001 was approximately £3.15 million, 3.99 million, and includes the costs associated with any teaching of orthodontics to the categories mentioned above who are trained in the dental school.</P>
      <P>In October this year, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North-Eastern Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training at the Dublin Dental School and Hospital for Specialist Dentist in Orthodontics qualifications. I have made available an additional £0.426 million, 0.541 million, in 2002 for this collaborative training programme between the three boards and the Dental School and Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty; he is currently liaising with the two dental schools in Dublin and Cork and the consultant orthodontists of the regional orthodontic units in the health boards on the provision conjointly of <Col N="706" /> specialist training programmes in 2002. In this regard, the Dublin Dental School and Hospital intends providing specialist training in orthodontics for an additional six trainees from the health boards in 2002, subject to the requirements laid down by the specialist advisory committee of the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry, ICSTD, on orthodontic consultant staffing. The ICSTD is the body recognised by the Dental Council for the purpose of granting evidence of satisfactory completion of specialist training.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training for these health boards to nine.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a Professor in Orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million, 1.269 million, was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to the implementation of the Children Act, 2001, on a phased basis. The National Children's Office has already established a high level group composed of senior officials of the relevant Departments and other concerned which will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act. This group is drawing up an implementation plan at present and it is intended to submit the plan to Government early next year.</P>
      <P>The Act has no direct implications for an identity register of vulnerable children. Under Children First, the practice of each health board having its own child protection notification system, CPNS, is being introduced. The CPNS is to be a health board record of every child about whom, following a preliminary assessment, there is a child protection concern. The CPNS aims to improve the management and record keeping of notifications across all health boards. It will also ensure uniformity of approach in assessing child protection notifications. All health boards are in the process of implementing the CPNS at present.</P>
      <P>The Children Act, 2001, will require strengthening and further development of a wide range of child protection and welfare services, including special care units, high support units, other residential care facilities, alternative care and intermediate care services, family support services and early intervention and preventative services. The recently published National Health Strategy states that &ldquo;family support services will be expanded&rdquo;&ndash; Action 27 &ndash; and this includes a specific commitment to the introduction of family welfare conferences and other services required to support the Children Act, 2001. In accordance with this policy the Department of Health and Children has allocated, for 2002, additional funding to establish springboard projects as a mainstream service of the health boards and for the development of new springboard initiatives in a number of areas which have been designated as RAPID areas of disadvantage. Health boards have also been requested to submit specific proposals for additional family support services as part of their service plans for 2002. It is envisaged that these proposals will cover a wide range of both safeguarding and supportive services, such as neighbourhood youth programmes, parenting programmes, early intervention services and the development of cross-sectoral co-ordination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital investment of approximately 38.09 million, £30 million, is being made available by <Col N="708" /> this Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 88 places. An additional 46 places are also planned as follows: in the eastern region, a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane; 12 high support places in Castleblayney, facilitating the Midland, North-Eastern, North-Western and Western Health Boards; a further five high support places and five special care places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board area. Places in these facilities are due to become available by mid 2002. The Special Residential Services Board, which was recently launched, will advise on and improve the co-ordination of special residential services for children convicted by the courts and for non-offending chidlren in need of special care and protection.</P>
    <P>The development of these services is ongoing and includes capital expenditure. However, the complete capital programme for 2002 relating to this area will not be finalised until early in the new year.</P>

The new unit will replace the old admissions unit at Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis. Patients are being transferred on a phased basis. The transfer of all patients to the new unit will be completed by the end of this week.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided in the context of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. A total of 650 of these beds will be in place by the end of 2002. The break-down by region of these beds is being finalised, in consultation with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board is in the process of finalising the draft brief for identified priority developments at the Ennis General Hospital. This will include an agreed functional content for the new development on the existing hospital site and describes the role of Ennis General Hospital in providing acute services in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>

      <P>National waiting list information is collated by my Department from data supplied by health boards and is broken down by the total number of adults and children waiting for procedures at hospitals within their respective areas. The information provided by health boards does not identify individuals or their place of residence.</P>
      <P>The numbers on waiting lists and the waiting times for hip replacements and ENT procedures in the Western Health Board, in the format collected by my Department, are being communicated separately to the Deputy. Cardiac surgery is not performed in the Western Health Board but is provided in three Dublin Hospitals and at Cork University Hospital. The total number waiting for cardiac surgery at 30 June 2001 was 420. The information requested by the Deputy in relation to orthodontic waiting lists is not routinely collected by my Department. Therefore, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board to compile the information requested and to forward it to the Deputy directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy, which I launched recently, places a new focus on waiting lists and includes a plan to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times. The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be <Col N="711" /> used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients, either from private hospitals in Ireland or, if necessary, from abroad.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted which has informed the new health strategy. The overall target is that an additional 3,000 beds will be in place by 2011 of which 650 beds will be provided by the end of 2002. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospital agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system.</P>

To date, invoices totalling £339,600, 431,200, have been paid by my Department. This includes the costs of the consultative process outlined below.</P>
      <P>The strategy was formulated on the basis of widespread consultation with the general public, members of the voluntary and community sector, health service staff at all levels and drew on the experience of experts from Ireland and abroad. This widespread consultative process included a national consultative forum and associated sub-groups on specific aspects of the health strategy, consultation with health board and Department of Health and Children staff, a publicity campaign that resulted in the receipt of over 1,500 submissions from members of the public and over 200 submissions from voluntary and professional organisations and market research. This has resulted in a strategy into which the public and organisations have had a real input.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 251 together.</P>
      <P>Information regarding the number of new house grants paid and new houses built in each of the past five years is contained in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin 2000, copies of which are available from the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>As it is possible to provide a reasonably sized four bedroomed house within the current upper floor area limit of 125 mf7&gt;2, I have no proposals to increase the maximum floor area limit for new house grant purposes.</P>
      <P>Increasing the new house grant above the current grant level of £3,000, 3,809, would have no additional benefit to the first time buyer as an increase would likely add to inflationary pressures in the new house market. I have, therefore, no proposals to increase the new house grant at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>Under existing national traffic regulations, every motor vehicle must be so constructed that the driver can at all times have a view of the road in front and to the sides of the vehicle, necessary to enable him/her to drive safely. Every motor vehicle must, depending on its type, be equipped with a rear view mirror or mirrors to enable the driver while seated in the driving seat to obtain an adequate view of the road to the rear of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>The most recent EU directive dealing with mirrors on motor vehicles is Directive 88/321/EEC, which deals with type approval of mirrors on new vehicles only. The directive provides a technical specification for the driver's field of view but does not address the problem of possible blind spots, particularly in the case of large articulated vehicles turning sharply. The directive is not mandatory on member states in relation to goods vehicles, except in so far as they may not refuse the initial registration, sale or entry into service on grounds relating to mirrors provided that they are type approved in accordance with Directive 88/321/EEC. The European Commission is now developing a further directive on this matter, which may address the issue of blind spots.</P>

      <P>Proposals for water and sewerage schemes for Carraroe were included in the list of schemes submitted by Galway County Council in 1999 in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Due to the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it has not been possible to include all schemes proposed by local authorities in the programme.</P>
      <P>In a revised priority list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the council last January, the South Connemara regional water supply scheme, which includes Carraroe, was placed third on the list of water schemes and the Carraroe sewerage scheme was placed fifth in the list of sewerage schemes for the period 2002-2006. The revised list will be taken into account in the context of the next phase of the water services investment programme.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I understand the county council intends to carry out remedial works to the existing water and sewerage schemes in Carraroe under the devolved small schemes programme.</P>

      <P>Irish regulations require lamps that show a light to the front of a vehicle to be fitted and constructed so that they will not dazzle or mislead other traffic when lit. In addition, such lamps must be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Exceptions to the dipping device requirement are made for direction indicators and for one or more other lamps with a combined maximum power output of seven watts.</P>
      <P>Dipped head lamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. The use of fog lamps is permitted only in fog or falling snow. Within this framework a maximum power rating is not specified for vehicle lights. The Garda is responsible for the enforcement of these regulations. Checks on head lamp alignment and condition are carried out as part of both the national car test and commercial vehicle testing scheme.</P>
      <P>Standards for lighting for new vehicles are specified in EU type approval law. These standards have been adopted at EU level following extensive consultation with vehicle and lighting manufacturing interests and with member states. All new cars sold in Ireland are required to meet the standards which are also deemed to comply with national vehicle lighting law. Within this framework, gas discharge head lamps have been type approved in accordance with European Union law and are consequently in compliance with Irish lighting law.</P>

      <P>In general, environmental management certification schemes, including ISO 14001, the international standard for environmental management systems, and EMAS, the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, provide a structured voluntary approach for controlling and reducing the environmental impacts of an organisation's day to day operations. The schemes were originally seen as an important source of authoritative information for the public and business in relation to reporting by commercial enterprises on their environmental performance and impacts. EMAS was revised in 2000 and extended to all organisations as well as industrial sites.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has a statutory obligation to exercise general supervision over the performance by local authorities of their statutory environmental protection functions. An environmental management system for assessing such performance is being developed and applied on a pilot basis by the EPA. While this system will be an appropriate tool for overseeing the performance by local authorities of their statutory environmental protection functions, local authorities are encouraged, under the revised guidelines on local agenda 21, which I published earlier this year, to develop environmental management systems both in respect of corporate planning and the operation of specific facilities.</P>
      <P>In order to demonstrate leadership in this matter, as well as for the more sustainable management of its own internal operations and resources, my Department has already applied to the National Standards Authority of Ireland for ISO 14001 certification.</P>

      <P>Under the existing regulations, the fee which must accompany an application for permission for retention of a structure is one and a half times the fee for a regular planning application.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, contains significant new provisions to improve the enforcement of the planning code and to prevent any abuse of the retention permission system. In the new planning and development regulations which I laid in draft before the Houses of the Oireachtas last week, I am proposing to set the application fee for retentions at the significantly higher level of three times the fee for an ordinary planning application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 156 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which I propose to commence in the new year, will increase the maximum fines which may be imposed for breaches of the planning <Col N="720" /> code. A person who is guilty of an offence of carrying out unauthorised development will in future be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both, or on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,500, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both. A person summarily convicted may be fined up to £1,500 or be imprisoned for up to six months. The imposition of fines, and the amount of such fine in individual cases, is of course a matter for the courts.</P>

      <P>The need for a particular focus on vulnerable road users, including cyclists, was a specific recommendation of the High Level Group on Road Safety in its 2nd Progress Report on the Government Strategy for Road Safety.</P>
      <P>My Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, has published a design manual for cycle facilities entitled <i>Provision of Cycle Facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas (March 1998)</i> which was circulated to all local authorities. The manual is intended to assist local authorities to provide cycle facilities to a uniform and high standard. Ensuring the safety of cyclists was an important consideration in developing the manual, which drew on international practice, particularly from the Netherlands and the UK.</P>
      <P>The manual sets out comprehensive guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities, specifically addresses the need for continuity in relation to cycle facilities and shows examples where this can be achieved with particular reference to the question of continuity through junctions and at pinch points. The DTO is now reviewing the cycle manual in the light of experience since 1998.</P>
      <P>The Annual Road Accident Facts Report prepared by the National Roads Authority reveal that in 2000, the number of cyclists killed was ten which is the lowest number of fatalities reported in 40 years and comprises just 2.4% of all fatalities compared to 8% a decade ago. The above reports are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

Local authorities are encouraged by my Department to acquire houses on a turnkey basis where they serve to increase output quickly under the programme as well as offering reasonable value for money and have been advised in guidelines that, where they are considering the acquis<Col N="724" /> ition of turnkey developments, they should advertise in the local and national newspapers for suitable proposals.</P>
      <P>The turnkey developments acquired by Donegal County Council, with the approval of my Department, complied with the above and public procurement requirements generally.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Designations under the town renewal scheme were announced in July 2000; while residential incentives were commenced immediately, the requirement to obtain EU Commission approval to the commercial incentives meant that these did not commence until 6 April 2001. Uncertainty arising from the delay in obtaining approval to these incentives may have contributed to slow take up of the scheme in some towns.</P>
      <P>The Government has announced a new initiative aimed at boosting the supply of rental residential accommodation in areas already designated under the town renewal and urban renewal schemes. The initiative involves the extension of section 23 type incentives with effect from 5 December 2001 to sites and sub-areas already designated for owner-occupier reliefs under these schemes. This initiative complements other measures aimed at boosting housing supply which were contained in budget 2002.</P>
      <P>These amendments represent a considerable enhancement of both schemes and will also complement local authority efforts in attracting investment for sites designated as commercial and industrial under these schemes.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, with pro-active promotion of the schemes by the relevant local authorities involved, activation of the section 23 initiative announced recently, and, in the case of the town renewal scheme, the removal of uncertainty in relation to the operation of the commercial and industrial incentives, significant progress will be achieved in the towns designated under both schemes. The schemes are being monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that the equity release in relation to elderly residents purchasing reversionary interests is treated on the same basis as a normal sale for means testing for old age non-contributory pensions.</Quest>
      <QRef>[31439/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of residence provisions have very specific policy objectives which may not apply in the case of equity release arrangements. In general, the sale of residence provisions involve assisting older people and people with disabilities who sell their principal residence, to move to accommodation which is more suitable for their needs or to move to a private nursing home. From April 2002, these groups will be able to avail of the provisions where they sell their principal residence to move in with their carer or move to sheltered or special housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> Equity release and other similar products allow home owners to benefit from some of the capital tied up in their homes, while continuing to live in these. The introduction of these products has implications for all non-contributory payments where the claimant is aged 65 years or over.</P>
    <P>These non-contributory payments are designed to provide financial support for people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension or benefit schemes. Entitlement to these payments is based on a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. Accordingly, any resources that a claimant and his/her spouse or partner may have are assessed.</P>
    <P>At present, sums of money raised through these products are assessable under the Department's capital assessment rules. Sums of money raised which are spent or disposed of immediately are not included in the means assessment.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, made provision for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital from October last year. This method is applied to all social assistance schemes other than supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Under this method, the first £10,000 of capital is disregarded; capital between £10,000 and £20,000 is assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; and capital above £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital.</P>
    <P>As the balance of capital on hands decreases, the claimant is entitled to have his or her means reassessed. This system reinforces the policy of ensuring that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the proportion of people with larger amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a study on the future financing of long-term care is under way. The role of equity release products in funding long-term care needs is being considered in this context. I expect that this study will be published early in the new year.</P>

      <Quest>if, in the context of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, which proposes to exempt awards made from scrutiny by social welfare inspectors in the context of means tested payments, he will take this matter up with his counterpart in the United Kingdom.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, does not in fact make <Col N="729" /> any provision to exempt awards made for the purposes of means-tested social security payments. However, there is provision under social welfare legislation to do this and has been used to exempt moneys received by way of compensation awarded to persons who have contracted hepatitis C and to persons who have disabilities caused by Thalidomide in the assessment of means for social assistance purposes. When the Residential Institutions Redress Bill is completed it is proposed to make legislative provision to exempt these awards from the means assessment for social assistance payments.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has already been in touch with the UK authorities in relation to potential beneficiaries resident in that jurisdiction and I will keep in touch with my colleague on this issue.</P>

      <P>In the past five years I have made a number of improvements to the free schemes which have added very significantly to the numbers benefiting under these schemes. The number of households benefiting from the electricity-gas allowance has increased from 211,000 in 1997 to 283,000 at present. The number of households benefiting from the TV licence <Col N="731" /> scheme has increased from 206,000 1997 to 220,000 at end 2000. The number of households benefiting from the telephone allowance has increased from 165,000 in 1997 to almost 244,000 at present and this is expected to increase by a further 13,600 from May next year as a result of improvements announced in the recent budget.</P>
      <P>The 2002 budget provides for a new household benefits scheme from May 2002 which is designed to align the eligibility criteria for the telephone allowance with those for the existing electricity/gas and TV licence schemes. This will bring these schemes into one combined package which will make it easier for people to claim their entitlements and, as already indicated, will entitle up to 13,600 additional people to telephone allowance. The budget also provided for an increase of 300 in the number of units under the free electricity/gas scheme with effect from February 2002. It is estimated that this will benefit around 280,000 households. In addition, from May 2002 the free travel companion pass will be extended to people in receipt of invalidity pension who are unable to travel alone which will benefit around 2,000 people.</P>
      <P>Earlier budgets provided for improvements as follows: extension of the companion free travel pass to all persons aged 75 or over who are unable to travel alone, 1998; extension of the telephone allowance to all persons in receipt of a carer's allowance, benefiting 10,000 carers, 1999; extension of the electricity/gas allowance and free television licence to all persons in receipt of a carer's allowance, benefiting 10,000 households, 2000; extension of the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence to all persons aged 75 or over benefiting 16,000 households, 2000; extension of all the free schemes to all persons aged 70 or over, benefiting 40,000 households, 2001.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table.</P>
      <P>In last week's budget, we announced further increases of £25.04, 31.00, representing increases of 37.1% and 34.9%, respectively. The table contains the actual and percentage increases in child benefit for the 1994-2002 period.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to extending pension cover to as many people as possible. In recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme, including a reduction in the average number of contributions required for a minimum pension to ten, the introduction of pro-rata pensions for those with mixed rate insurance records and the special pension for those with pre-1953 insurance contributions. These measures are of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after children, or caring full-time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 and allows for periods spent out of the workforce caring for children or sick relatives to be disregarded when a person's contribution record is being averaged for pension purposes. This scheme is at present being reviewed as part of an overall review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension, the first phase of which was published in August 2000. I understand the second phase report is almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish it early in the new year. Changes to the homemaker's scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of the phase two report.</P>

      <P>Staff training is also an important element of the Department's response to the needs of people with special needs. In this regard awareness seminars on deafness have been held and attended by front line staff members who deal with customers on a one-to-one basis. In addition members of my Department's staff have been trained in sign language and are available to provide this service at public consultation meetings where required.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives sponsored by my Department include disability awareness seminars for staff working in relevant areas. Specialised training of this nature augments a comprehensive customer training programme for all staff. This programme covers all aspects of customer service including issues such as disability awareness, and equality issues. So far, more than 2,500 staff members have completed this training programme.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5, 6.35, per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3, 3.81, per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to £8, 10.16, per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3, 3.81, per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or health board payment, satisfy a means test, live alone or with qualified dependants or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right. People on short-term payments, such as disability benefit, do not qualify for the standard fuel allowance of £5, 6.35, per week. However, people who have been on disability benefit for three months or more may qualify for a £3, 3.81, per week smokeless fuel allowance, subject to the other standard conditions for receipt of fuel allowances. The person concerned is in this category and is paid the smokeless fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>The living alone allowance is a weekly payment for people receiving certain social welfare payments and who are aged 66 or over and who live alone. The individual in question is not aged 66 and, therefore, does not qualify for the allowance.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6, 7.62. This £6, 7.62, represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The scheme operates on the basis that the person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. The principal is not, and never was, taken into account in the calculation of the mortgage interest supplement because it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the individual in question feels that he may have an entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement he should make an application by con<Col N="737" /> tacting the community welfare officer at his local health centre.</P>

      <P>There already exists a scheme in the State which entitles people to a minimum weekly income. Supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly income, based on criteria set out in legislation. Apart from a number of excluded categories, anyone in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs is entitled to assistance under the SWA scheme.</P>
      <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, reported in September this year. The terms of reference of the group required it to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns, and examine the issue of relative income poverty.</P>
      <P>The report is a comprehensive account of the many complex issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of welfare payments and represents a valuable input to policy development in this area for the future. Copies of the report have been placed in the Oireachtas Library and it is also available on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>The group recognised, as have many reports of this kind in the past, that adequacy is a subjective concept and that it is not possible to arrive at a definition of income adequacy in an objective or scientific way. It concentrated on the lowest rates of payment, that is, supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance, in terms of trying to arrive at a suitable benchmark for adequacy for these payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it did not reach consensus, the group provided a majority recommendation which, along with many other concerns, was considered in the context of the framing of the recent budget <Col N="738" /> and will form an important input into the development of welfare policy generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been achieved in recent years in reducing the incidence and effects of poverty and unemployment traps in the social welfare system. Among the measures which have contributed to this improvement are: the continued enhancement of child benefit as part of a strategy of making child income support more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents; the introduction of net income assessment for the purposes of determining entitlement to family income supplement, FIS; the introduction of a more tapered qualified adult allowance, which provides for the retention of the allowance at a reduced level when the spouse or partner of a social welfare claimant takes up work or gets a pay increase; a more tapered withdrawal of supplementary welfare allowance rent or mortgage supplements and the introduction of an income disregard of £25 &ndash; 31.74 &ndash; for those in part-time work.</P>
      <P>On a general level, my Department constantly monitors the operation of its schemes with a view to ensuring that poverty traps and employment disincentives are removed. This is in line with the national anti-poverty strategy which identifies tackling unemployment as one of the key areas for helping people out of poverty. In this context, I have introduced a number of further measures in the budget for 2002 which will minimise poverty traps in the system where they still occur. First, the FIS income limits are being increased by approximately £27 &ndash; 34.28 &ndash; at each point, adding an extra £16 &ndash; 20 &ndash; on average to the payments of existing recipients. Second, I have substantially increased the rates of qualified adult allowance and raised the upper income limits governing entitlement to these payments. Third, I have increased the income disregard under rent supplement which applies to earnings from part-time work from £25 &ndash; 31.74 &ndash; to £39.38 &ndash; 50.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these improvements, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that poverty traps can feature in any system which is based on income thresholds. Nevertheless, I am confident that the measures outlined have had the effect of greatly reducing the incidence and extent of the poverty traps and ensured that they can only arise significantly further up the income distribution than was the case previously.</P>

      <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with seven countries: Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. Ireland also entered into a bilateral understanding with Quebec on 1 October 1994. All these agreements are in operation. The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both in Ireland and the other country to which the agreements apply.</P>
      <P>The following Irish benefits are normally covered: old age (contributory) pension; retirement pension; invalidity pension; widow's and widower's (contributory) pension; orphan's (contributory) allowance; and bereavement grant.</P>
      <P>The bilateral agreements mainly provide for the adding together of periods of insurance and, where appropriate, periods treated as equivalent to periods of insurance completed in Ireland and the other country involved, for the purposes of calculating and awarding pensions.</P>
      <P>These pensions can also be paid to those residing in the territory of the other country. Consideration is given to concluding further such bilateral agreements if warranted by the numbers employed in Ireland and the other country concerned or where a request is received from another country. Requests for such agreements have been received from the Republic of Korea and the Czech Republic and negotiations with the authorities in these countries have commenced.</P>

      <P>To qualify for a full rate old age (contributory) or retirement pension a person must have achieved a minimum number of paid contributions, at the appropriate rate, and a yearly average of at least 48 contributions over their working lives. Those who do not have sufficient contributions for a full rate payment may receive a reduced rate or <i>pro rata</i> pension. At <Col N="740" /> present a person may receive a 50% pension with a yearly average of 10 contributions.</P>
      <P>In the context of a contributory pension scheme I consider it important that the benefits paid to a person reflect the contribution and commitment he or she has made to the social insurance fund. I am satisfied that when compared to the level of contributions required for a full rate payment the pensions being received by those on reduced rate or <i>pro rata</i> pensions represent very good value for their contributions.</P>
      <P>Those receiving reduced rate or <i>pro rata</i> pensions will receive increases arising from the budget which reflect the rate at which they are paid. For instance, people receiving a 50% pension will receive 50% of the increase awarded in full rate cases.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which free travel is available to people living in areas without public transport; the extent to which he intends to improve the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>Two main groups have difficulties in accessing public transport, those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport nor avail of access to public transport.</P>
      <P>While my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport.</P>
      <P>In this regard, an interdepartmental committee on rural transport chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise is considering issues relating to the availability of transport services in rural areas. I understand the committee will report in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> In addition, my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, announced an important rural transport initiative last July. A sum of £3.5 million &ndash; 4.44 million &ndash; has been provided under the national development plan to support the development of pilot public transport initiatives in rural areas. The aim of the funding is to encourage innovative community-based initiatives to provide transport services in rural areas with a view to addressing the issue of social exclusion in rural Ireland which is caused by lack of access to transport. My Department is in discussions with the Department of Public Enterprise on the role the free travel scheme can play in supporting these pilot projects.</P>

      <P>Since responsibility for the main means tested payment for people with disabilities, that is, the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, was transferred from the health boards to my Department in October 1996, a range of significant improvements, including improvements in the means testing arrangements, have been introduced. As a consequence, there has been a substantial increase in the number of recipients of disability allowance &ndash; up from 34,500 in October 1996 to 57,160 at the end of November 2001, an increase of 66%.</P>
      <P>The main improvements in the means testing arrangements which have been provided for and which also apply to the means tested blind person's pension scheme include substantial increases in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which may be disregarded for means test purposes. With the further increase announced in last week's budget, the level of this disregard will have almost tripled &ndash; up from £35.20 &ndash; 44.70 &ndash; to £94.50 &ndash; 120.00. This disregard has also been extended to earnings from rehabilitative self-employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major improvement in the method of assessing capital was introduced in October 2000, with the first £10,000 &ndash; 12,697 &ndash; being disregarded, an increase of £8,000 &ndash; 10,158 &ndash; and the method of assessing capital above this level improved. Since April this year the full rate disability allowance is paid where the person's partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment. This improvement has resulted in weekly increases of between £35.00 &ndash; 44.44 &ndash; and £46.00 &ndash; 58.41 &ndash; for those affected. Up to £150,000 &ndash; 190,461 &ndash; from the proceeds of the sale of a person's residence is exempted for disability allowance and blind person's pension purposes, with effect from April of this year. In addition, the back to work scheme has been extended to recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension. Under this scheme a per<Col N="742" /> son is allowed to retain their weekly payment on a sliding scale in addition to their income from employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P>While significant improvements have been made in the means tested payments for people with disabilities in recent years, it is nevertheless recognised that more needs to be done and I will continue to examine the potential for further improvements in this area, having regard to available resources and the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>In March 1999, I announced arrangements regarding turf cutting in blanket bogs in candidate special areas of conservation, cSACs. These included cessation of the use of sausage machines and provisions for the purchase, at £250 per acre, of areas of blanket bog actually being cut and payment of compensation of £1,000 to domestic turf cutters who had been cutting regularly in the preceding five years and undertook to immediately cease cutting.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that the person concerned has no wish to dispose of the lands involved and wants to continue to cut turf for domestic use. I am, therefore, arranging for staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to examine further the extent to which continued turf cutting for domestic purposes at this location is compatible with conservation of the cSAC.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 319 and 320 together.</P>
      <P>The townland of Monakeeeba East lies wholly within candidate special area of conservation, Barroughter Bog &ndash; Site Code 231 &ndash; in County Galway. Section 4 of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. 94 of 1997), specifies the procedures in respect of the manner of notification of candidate special areas of conservation. Considerable efforts were made to locate the address of and notify in writing every occupier/owner of land in the proposed site. A total of 135 landowners were notified in writing of the proposals to designate Barroughter Bog. Such notification included details of compensation arrangements, appeals mechanisms and a description and a detailed map of the site.</P>
      <P>In addition, advertisements appeared in the local press &ndash;<i>Connaught Tribune</i> 13 March 1997, <i>Galway Advertiser </i>13 March 1997 and <i>Connaught Sentinel</i> 11 March 1997 &ndash; detailing the townlands affected by the proposed designation of Barroughter Bog. This advertisement provided contact names and telephone numbers of conservation rangers who might be contacted for further clarification. In addition, maps of the pSACs were displayed in one or more local Garda stations, local authority offices and local offices of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Teagasc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 23 August 2001, all the names and addresses of the bog owners who carried out maintenance work on their plots at that time were <Col N="747" /> unknown to my Department. The person referred to by the Deputy was involved in works within Barroughter Bog cSAC that were considered damaging to the environmental objectives of the cSAC. He was asked to cease these operations by local staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and a letter issued from Dúchas head office advising him of the unauthorised nature of these works. The letter also warned him that if he continued with these works a High Court injunction would be sought against him to prevent further damage being done to the cSAC. At the time the letter was issued to the person, the individual owners of the plots involved were not known to my officials. Contact was subsequently made with representatives of the local bog committee and, following a meeting with Dúchas officials, agreement was reached on what works would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>My officials contacted An Garda Síochána to assist it in carrying out its duties, as the person was not co-operating with its requests to cease operations. A garda was asked to arrange a suitable time and place for the person to meet with my officials, but the person chose not to attend. The person had indicated to one of my officials that he would provide a list of the bog owners. However, he subsequently stated that he was precluded from doing so by the Data Protection Act, 1988. No further attempts were made by my officials to obtain this information from the person.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of an entitlement to compensation as a result of intervention by Dúchas officials in this matter. However, if the person mentioned feels that he has a case for compensation, he should submit a written application outlining the basis of his claim and the nature and amount of compensation sought. On receipt of this information his application will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 321 and 322 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of <Col N="748" /> buildings in private ownership. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings which is being administered by local authorities. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority, Galway County Council in this instance.</P>
    <P>The owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware no doubt that last year I launched my strategy under the national development plan for the continued conservation and protection, in the period up to 2006, of the sizeable portfolio of over 740 national monuments and historic properties in the care of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. Having conducted a detailed review of the properties under my control I have identified in excess of 100 sites which will require major work from either a conservation, protection or presentation point of view during the above period. To this end, I have agreed to provide funding of in excess of £65 million to allow this essential work to be undertaken over a six year period.</P>
    <P>While it is neither feasible nor desirable for the State to control all heritage properties, I am conscious of the need to support the protection of the heritage not in State care. The national heritage plan, which will be published next year, will outline the future approach to the protection of heritage properties in private ownership. This will include the use of the planning and development acts, the completion of surveys such as the national inventory of architectural heritage and increased levels of training in skills and craft areas, which are crucial to the protection of heritage in private ownership.</P>

      <P>The need for a particular focus on vulnerable road users, including cyclists, was a specific recommendation of the high level group on road safety in its second progress report on the Government strategy for road safety. My Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, has published a design manual for cycle facilities entitled, <i>Provision of Cycle Facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas (March 1998)</i>, which was circulated to all local authorities. The manual is intended to assist local authorities to provide cycle facilities to a uniform and high standard. Ensuring the safety of cyclists was an important consideration in developing the manual, which drew on international practice, particularly from the Netherlands and the UK.</P>
      <P>The manual sets out comprehensive guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities, specifically addresses the need for continuity in relation to cycle facilities and shows examples where this can be achieved with particular reference to the question of continuity through junctions and at pinch points. The DTO is now reviewing the cycle manual in the light of experience since 1998.</P>
      <P>The annual road accident facts report prepared by the National Roads Authority reveals that in 2000, the number of cyclists killed was ten which is the lowest number of fatalities reported in 40 years and comprises just 2.4% of all fatalities compared to 8% a decade ago. The above reports are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ir.) Act, 1851, which deals with all cases of summary jurisdiction, applies to prosecutions for drink driving offences and provides that &ldquo;the complaint shall be made within six months from the time when the cause of complaint shall have arisen&rdquo;. The time limit of six months, therefore, applies to the application for the issue of a summons and not the issuing of a summons.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Supreme Court has held &ndash; DPP &ndash; f2&gt;V &ndash; Gill [1980] I.R. 263 &ndash; that, where a summons is struck out by a court due to non-appearance by a Garda, a fresh summons may be issued in respect of the same offence. Furthermore, if the original application was made within six months, it does not matter that the fresh summons was issued after the expiration of the six months period. The judgment, however, goes on to state that if, because of undue delay in issuing the summons or in bringing it to a hearing, the defendant is unfairly prejudiced in making his defence, natural justice may require that the summons be dismissed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government's national child care strategy under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, has assigned county-city child care committees as the key local component in the development of a co-ordinated approach to quality child care. The county-city child care committees are charged with the responsibility for the effective inclusion of child care needs within the county-city development plans being drawn up by the county and city development boards. Some 33 city-county child care committees have been established and are at varying stages of development. Each committee is in the process of developing a county-city child care plan, 2001-06, which will plan for the child care services for the counties based on a shared vision and analysis of the needs within each city-county area. The target date for receipt of the county child care plans in my Department is the end of 2001. The plans will then be submitted to the national co-ordinating child care committee, chaired by my Department, for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The membership of the Cork county child care committee is representative of statutory and voluntary child care interests in the county including a representative of parents.

      <P>Specific procedures are, in fact, used in coroner inquests but are not part of existing legislation. Proposals arising from the recommendations of the working group on the review of the coroner service envisage that detailed coroners' rules be incorporated into new coroner legislation, the preparation of which has already been approved by the Government. Work on the development of the new rules has already commenced.</P>

      <P>It would be generally inappropriate for me to comment on personnel related matters concerning an individual in my Department. I decided, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to extend the term of office of the current principal probation and welfare officer for a period of six months. The person concerned will remain at his current salary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an interim measure and arises from a Government decision. The Government, some time ago, deferred consideration of the final report of the expert group on the probation and welfare service pending completion of a value for money audit of the probation and welfare service being carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office. Extending the term of office of the person concerned will ensure that the current management structure remains in place until my Department has had an opportunity to go back <Col N="753" /> to Government with proposals regarding the future of the service.</P>
    <P>As regards qualifications for the post, it is my Department's present position that any new head of service should have the necessary management attributes to head up the service and, while a social services background may be desirable, it will not be an essential requirement for the position.</P>

      <P>A number of options to enhance the current Garda accommodation at Ballymote require to be fully considered. Earlier this year the Office of Public Works was requested to negotiate with the adjoining property owners with a view to obtaining the required extra space to allow the Garda station to be adequately developed. Very recently, that office was requested to examine the option of purchasing a premises in the town which could be suitable, with necessary refurbishment, for a Garda station. Accordingly, the accommodation requirements of Ballymote Garda Station will be further considered on receipt of that office's advice.</P>

      <P>In addition to the Garda recruitment measures outlined in my reply of 20 November 2001, the Government, on 16 October 2001, approved the civilianisation of 496 posts currently occupied by Garda personnel. These posts are in administrative and technical areas of the Garda organisation and are located at Garda Headquarters, the Garda College and in districts and divisions throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The civilianisation of these posts will allow for the release of Garda personnel to operational policing, in particular, to tackle and prevent crime thus enhancing public safety. The release of these members will not affect the Government's policy of increasing the strength of the force to 12,000.</P>
      <P>A joint Department and Garda team has been established to oversee the recruitment of civilians and the implementation of the Government decision. Approximately 150 of the posts will be civilianised over the next three years with the remaining posts civilianised over a longer period.</P>

      <P>The draft national plan for women, 2001-05, was launched by the Minister of <Col N="756" /> State with responsibility for equality, Deputy Mary Wallace, on 16 October 2001. This publication is designed to guide and inform the consultation process now under way.</P>
      <P>The consultation process is being managed by a steering committee chaired by my Department with representatives from a range of women's groups and including the social partners and other Departments. My Department, with the guidance of the steering committee, has made more than £200,000 &ndash; 253,947 &ndash; in funding available to 200 groups around the country to facilitate them in disseminating information, holding workshops or discussion groups to assist them in formulating and submitting views on the draft national plan for women.</P>
      <P>The consultation process will be as comprehensive and wide ranging as possible. All relevant interests will be consulted, including women's groups, other non-governmental organisations, NGOs, the social partners, other stakeholders, women generally, Departments and other statutory bodies.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the consultation process are to inform women of Government commitments under the 12 critical areas of concern of the UN Platform for Action and Beijing Declaration, 1995, assemble proposals on the ways and means of measuring progress on the advancement of women, and articulate a vision of how these proposals might be addressed in the future.</P>
      <P>Members of the public, organisations directly involved in women's issues, the social partners or any organisation or group which has a view about how best to promote the advancement of women in society and how progress should be measured, are invited to submit their views. A successful consultation process will enable the Government to work in partnership to develop and implement a meaningful vision for the future rooted in women's actual concerns and aspirations.</P>
      <P>The consultation process will culminate in a number of public fora spread throughout the country in spring 2002. It is hoped to submit the draft final plan to Government for approval and publication as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following tabular statements. Considerable progress is being made in processing asylum applications. I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Appli<Col N="757" /> cations Commissioner, ORAC, that since July 2001 cases scheduled, processed and completed significantly exceeded intake.</P>
      <P>In July, 961 applications were received, 1,473 interviews were scheduled and 1,072 cases processed. In August, 983 applications were received, 1,543 interviews were scheduled and 1,407 cases processed. In September, 855 applications were received, 1,594 interviews scheduled and 1,145 cases processed. In October, 892 applications were received, 1,213 interviews were scheduled and 1,506 cases processed. In November some 880 applications were received, 1,222 interviews were scheduled and approximately 1,736 cases were processed to conclusion.</P>
      <P>The figures provide a clear indication that the increase in processing capacity, which has been put in place as part of the Government's strategy, is making a real impact on the backlog of cases on hands and will help to progressively reduce processing times on an incremental basis. As I informed the House in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 110, 125 and 930 of 3 October 2001 and Parliamentary Question No. 109 of 13 November 2001, it is expected that by the end of this year all outstanding cases from 1998 to the end of 2000 will have been scheduled for interview with the overwhelming majority processed to finality. Thus, from the end of this year, the ORAC will effectively focus mainly on applications submitted in 2001.</P>
      <P>In relation to appeals, I have been informed by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, that it now expects to complete approximately 3,600 appeals in 2001. As with the ORAC, having regard to the increased processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's strategy, there has been a significant increase in the number of hearings scheduled with over 3,000 hearings expected to be scheduled for 2001 to end of year compared with 1,119 for 2000.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are now approximately 4,900 backlog cases, that is, cases which are more than six months old, on hands in ORAC and RAT as at 30 November 2001 and, as I outlined in my replies of 3 October and 13 November, the vast majority of these are in the final stages of processing.</P>

      <P>The family referred to arrived in the State on 1 December 2000 and sought asylum. Following an interview, it was concluded that their application was not such as to entitle them to a declaration as refugees. They were informed of this decision on 2 March 2001. Their subsequent appeal was refused by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 27 June 2001.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the family in question were informed on 9 August 2001 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in their case. They were given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the orders are made or consenting to the making of deportation orders. A further letter issued to them on 23 November last which reiterated the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the orders are made or consenting to the making of deportation orders. Their reply is still awaited and I expect the file to be submitted to me for consideration shortly.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, provides that every person born in the island of Ireland is entitled to be an Irish citizen. This feature of Irish citizenship law is unique in the European Union, and unusual world wide. In other EU member states the citizenship of a child born in that state is generally dependent on the citizenship of the parents and/or the status and duration of residence of the parents in the state concerned.</P>
      <P>The entitlement to citizenship by birth is also a constitutional right arising from Article 2 of the Constitution. Accordingly, a constitutional amendment would be required before any alteration of the existing statutory position. In line with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Fajujonu case [1990] 2 I.R. 151, subject to the common good, a non-Irish national who becomes the parent of an Irish citizen has a strong claim to be allowed to reside in the State with that citizen. There has been a significant increase in the number of applications from non-nationals to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen child in the last year. To end November, my Department has received 5,247 applications for permission to remain on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen from current or former asylum applicants.</P>
      <P>Evidence suggests that a significant proportion of adult female asylum applicants are pregnant upon arrival in the State and that their decision to seek asylum in Ireland is, at least in part, motivated by the anticipation of the benefits which might accrue for themselves, their partner and their child as a result of that child being born in Ireland. While it is the case that some such persons could also have a well-founded basis for seeking asylum, a large proportion of such applicants either withdraw their asylum claims when seeking permission to remain on the basis of parentage, or are refused status under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996. There have also been instances of attempted abuse by the submission of false claims of parentage. In the light of these realities my Department is keeping this issue under review.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department are currently in the process of conducting Christmas reviews and, as such, the figures requested by the Deputy are not yet available. However, I propose to issue a press statement nearer to Christmas on this matter once final figures are available.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested in figures for recent years. In 2000 about 250 prisoners were granted varying periods of temporary release at Christmas under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960. This was roughly 8% of the prisoner population. The corresponding numbers released for Christmas in 1999 and 1998 were 303 and 282, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> Many of the prisoners who will be released are nearing the end of their sentences while others will be serving relatively short sentences. The overriding concern, in considering applications for Christmas release from prisoners, is the safety of the public. In addition to compassionate and humane considerations, other criteria taken into account include the nature and gravity of the offence, length of sentence served to date, prior record on temporary release, if any, and previous criminal history.</P>
    <P>The periods of release granted generally vary from a few hours, in some cases accompanied by another responsible person or, exceptionally, under escort, up to two weeks. All releases are subject to stringent conditions, which in the vast majority of cases includes a requirement to report on a regular basis to his or her local Garda station. Any offender who breaks these conditions may be arrested and returned immediately to prison by the Garda.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there has been no noticeable decrease in the price of heroin in recent months and that it would appear the war in Afghanistan has not had any noticeable effect on the present supply or price of heroin in this country.</P>
      <P>In the new, but still very unsettled situation in Afghanistan, EU member states and other international partners has begun a review of the question of opiate cultivation and production in that country with a view to assessing how best to address the problem. The question of assistance to farmers, including alternative income generation, to encourage them to reduce their cultivation of illegal drugs will be an important factor. In this context, the Deputy should note that the EU recently appointed a special representative in Afghanistan who is mandated to manage the Union's role in the reconstruction of the country, including co-operation in international efforts to combat illicit drug trafficking.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the guidelines for the proposed tourism product development scheme, which is to be funded under the local enterprise development priority of the BMW and the S and E operational programmes.</P>
      <P>As I have advised the House before, the launch of the scheme was delayed due to the fact that, for the first time, a scheme of this nature had to be individually notified to the competition directorate of the European Commission under the state aids rules for regional aid. State aids clearance was eventually obtained from the European Commission on 7 November 2001.</P>
      <P>The present position is that Bord Fáilte, in consultation with my Department, is re-examining its draft guidelines in the light of the very detailed conditions laid down in the Commission's formal decision. I hope to formally launch the scheme in the new year, at which time there will be a call for project proposals and all the necessary materials, including guidelines, will be made available to interested parties.</P>
      <P>Factual information in relation to the tourism measures within the regional operational programmes is available in the form of the programme complements for tourism sub-measures 1 to 3 and I am arranging for extracts from the BMW operational programme to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In terms of funding for the tourism product development scheme, I point out that the national development plan has earmarked some 130 million &ndash; circa £100 million &ndash; in public sector support, including 55 million &ndash; £43 million &ndash; from the European Regional Development Fund in the period to 2006. As outlined in the programme complements, the European Regional Development Fund funded grants will be paid to grantees by the implementing body, that is, Bord Fáilte. In the case of public sector developments, the Exchequer's commitment will be provided through the Votes relevant to the project promoters. The product development subhead in the Vote of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation for 2002 will be B9.</P>
      <P>As regards ongoing investment in tourism product, I point out that grant aid under the former Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 has continued to be drawn down as projects have been developed. Some £17 million &ndash; 21.6 million &ndash; of grants for tourism projects were paid out last year and the forecast spend for this year is £16 million &ndash; 20.3 million.</P>

      <P>The Committee Stage of the debate on the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, will commence on Thursday next. During that debate I expect we will have a detailed discussion on this and other issues. At this stage I will say that I have considerable sympathy for the viewpoint underlying the Deputy's Question. However, preliminary inquiries suggest that people who were sent to the institutions concerned for reasons other than as a criminal sanction do not suffer the status of having been convicted of criminal acts. However, I am having further inquiries made as to the precise status in criminal law of the people concerned and will return to the matter again in the forthcoming Committee Stage debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356, 378 and 379 together.</P>
      <P>The issue referred to has been brought to my attention. The question of developing positive attitudes and values toward the elderly is addressed in the &ldquo;Myself and Others&rdquo; strand of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum for primary schools, where there is a particular focus on developing a sense of care and respect for the dignity of other people, including the elderly. Discrete time during the school day is allotted to the implementation of the SPHE curriculum, but the values that inform it should permeate all activities throughout the school day. This important principle would, therefore, apply to the content of textbooks and other materials that are used to teach other aspects of the curriculum.</P>
      <P>Textbooks and activity books are not part of the prescribed curriculum for schools. However, schools frequently use textbooks to support the implementation of the curriculum. The selection of books and other materials to support the implementation of the curriculum is a matter for school authorities and teachers.</P>
      <P>Editors of textbooks and activity books for use in primary schools select the content of such books. The material selected for inclusion in textbooks reflects the personal preferences of the editors. When selecting material for textbooks, editors are required to follow guidelines drawn up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to ensure that the textbooks conform to the requirements of the curriculum. Editors should follow the specifications for textbooks provided by the NCCA, including the need to ensure the appropriateness of the selected material to the age and the developmental level of the pupils for whom the books are intended.</P>
      <P>I have referred the issues raised by the Deputies to the NCCA to see if their guidelines for publishers address the concerns expressed. However, the parents themselves should bring the issues of concern to them directly to the publishers of the textbook and to the school authorities.</P>

      <P>The management authorities of the school concerned have requested a review of the school's overall accommodation needs, including <Col N="767" /> the need for the provision of a technology room. In response, my Department has indicated that any building works required on health and safety grounds will be considered for grant aid. In this regard, the lowest tender has been approved for the provision of six temporary classrooms to facilitate the vacation of two of the school buildings. According to a health and safety report, these buildings are unsuitable for conversion into teaching accommodation.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is one of two schools currently serving the post-primary needs of the area concerned. Enrolments have declined significantly at the two schools in recent years and projections indicate that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. In the circumstances, the issue of rationalisation of post-primary facilities was raised with both sets of trustees last year. A final decision regarding long-term accommodation needs will be taken, having regard to the outcome of deliberations on rationalisation and the availability of capital funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The school referred to by the Deputy has the services of a full-time caretaker under this scheme. The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</P>
      <P>The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment, CE, schemes, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress on the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My <Col N="771" /> Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. In line with the new arrangements, the school referred to by the Deputy has recently received a further payment of £2,620 &ndash; 3,326.71 &ndash; towards the cost of secretarial services.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses. These schemes include the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate (PLC) courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the con<Col N="772" /> ditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the students referred to by the Deputy. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights of people with disabilities to employment and to access to a wide range of services, including education, is an issue to which the Government is strongly committed. This commitment is reflected in the enactment during the term of this Government of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000. The latter, in particular, asserted the right of people with disabilities to education without fear of discrimination. In addition to these Acts, this Government has also enacted the Education Act, 1998, and the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, both of which provide strong statements of <Col N="774" /> principle in respect of the education of people with disabilities and provide meaningful protections to ensure access to education for such people. To back up those legislative provisions, the Government, during its term, has committed very substantial additional resources to special education.</P>
      <P>In so far as there remain areas of law where the rights of children and adults to access to and benefit from education are not sufficiently guaranteed or where structures are insufficient to deliver on those rights, I propose bringing forward a Bill early in the new year to remedy any deficiencies. These detailed statutory provisions will be enacted in consultation with the education partners and with those who have a special interest in the education of people with disabilities. Following debate in this House, the Bill will, in my view, provide an effective guarantee that all children and adults with disabilities will have the same right of access to and benefit from education as their peers who do not have disabilities.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants schemes, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of means under the third level maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income from all sources with certain social welfare and health board payments being exempt. When assessing income from self-employment or farming, the amount assessed is the adjusted profit or loss for income tax purposes from all self-employed activities, both Irish and foreign, <Col N="775" /> whether or not they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Finance leases are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes. There are no plans at present to alter the treatment of finance leases in the calculation of reckonable income under the higher education grants schemes.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a maintenance grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that the Deputy's question relates to progression at postgraduate level, in the context of eligibility for a higher education maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>Prior to 2000, the higher education grants scheme precluded grants being awarded to candidates who already held a postgraduate qualification and were pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.</P>
      <P>However, in October 2000, I amended the student support schemes to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment became operative from the 2000-01 academic year and, accordingly, students who were pursuing, in that year, a postgraduate course which represented progression, became eligible to receive a grant for maintenance and fees, subject to the other conditions of the grant scheme.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to give retrospective effect to this amendment to cover academic years prior to 2000-01.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding to primary and second level schools on the basis of <i>per capita</i> grants with additional grants towards ancillary services such as caretaking and secretarial. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment schemes, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, 50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, 126.98, per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the school services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20, 25.40, per pupil to £50, 63.49, per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70, 88.88, per pupil next September and to £78, 99.04, per pupil in January 2003. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. These increases are in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.</P>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000, 5,078.96, to £15,600, 19,807.91, per year while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000, 12,697.38, to £39,000, 49,519.79, over this school year and the next. In the case of second level schools receiving grants of £55, 69.84, per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to a maximum of £19,250, 24,442.46, per school, the annual grant of £78, 99.04, under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250, 73,962.24, per year. My Department has issued circulars to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. It is intended that payments will issue to schools shortly.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides grants to schools that are not directly linked to any objective pay scales. Therefore, the level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial and caretaking services, as resources permit. As the secretaries and caretakers are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department does not operate a national scheme for the provision of homework clubs. However, my Department operates a number of schemes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage under which resources are allocated for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in school. These include the eight to 15 year olds early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative. The position of the school referred to will be considered in any future expansion of these schemes.</P>
