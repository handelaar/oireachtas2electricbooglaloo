      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I chair Cabinet committees on asylum seekers, children, European affairs, housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships and social inclusion. As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have not ever been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality. As always, questions on particular policy issues should be tabled to relevant Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What progress has been made on social exclusion, particularly the problem of drugs which is relevant to the sub-committees mentioned by the Taoiseach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is about progress made by Cabinet committees chaired by the Taoiseach and it is not in order to seek to broaden the ambit of the question by raising matters of Government policy and matters covered by the committees. The Deputy's supplementary question concerns Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My question concerns the progress of the work of Cabinet sub-committees. I am asking about the sub-committee on social exclusion. What progress has been made on social exclusion by the sub-committee, in particular the issues that feed into the drugs problem in Dublin and the rest of the country?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach may reply on various specific policy matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The national drugs strategy, which has been presented following about 15 months of work, develops what has been done in relation to drugs in recent years. It has a broader remit and extends into many more areas than current measures. The strategy sets out 100 positive actions, agreed following the deliberations of the sub-committee and including suggestions from all groups that have a role in dealing with this problem. The strategy will take effect throughout the country, including the 13 areas where drugs are most prevalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the sub-committee considered, on a cross-party basis, the effectiveness of methadone? Is the substitution of methadone for heroin working? What assessment has been made on a cross-party basis of rehabilitating people to get them back into the mainstream of society? What progress has been made? What measures are used to indicate the level of progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The methadone programme, while perhaps not entirely effective, has been enormously successful. Research shows that people get off drugs through methadone programmes. It is not the final result for many heroin users, as many of them find it difficult to get off methadone and need further rehabilitation and treatment. It is not as common as it once was to go through a detoxification system. Attempts are being made to extend the methadone programme to more areas, although the substance of the programme will remain as it has been since 1995.</P>
      <P>More methadone facilities will be developed in communities so that people can attend treatment centres locally, rather than having to travel to large centres where difficulties ensue. Research recently carried out by the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, in conjunction with the national drugs strategy team and local area teams shows there is support in local areas for community treatment centres and for more centres dealing with fewer people. Programmes like those I have mentioned will continue under the national drugs strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that research carried out by Area Response Crumlin and others shows that about 20% of those who abuse heroin sit the leaving certificate, compared to an average of about 80% nationally? Have the Taoiseach and the sub-committee on social exclusion examined that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-committee is a matter of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that people who have little opportunity for second level, let alone third level, education are among those most likely to fall into the <Col N="199" /> trap of abusing hard drugs? Is that issue being considered on the agenda as a social exclusion issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but again it is not just within the committee; it is also due to the work and research of all the people involved, whom I should thank for the work they have put in over the past 12 to 15 months in the preparation of the national drugs strategy and their plans for the future. All of these communities were involved in devising the plans and arrangements to try to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>It has always been a fact that people in the most marginalised and disadvantaged communities are targeted and, unfortunately, are more likely to engage in using drugs of one form or another. For that reason the efforts of the social inclusion committee across all Departments has been to try to put in place the necessary rehabilitation, medical, paramedical and recreation facilities in those areas. A range of projects under sports grants, recreation grants, in the health area and the children area have been introduced in those areas.</P>
      <P>The combination of these problems many of which have been going on for a number of years and other new ones which are the subject of new research, and the issues involved in addressing them, which are outlined in the drugs strategy programme, is having an effect. A large number of people are still on drugs and that has an effect on the most disadvantaged communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is chairing the sub-committee on housing infrastructure and public private partnerships. In respect of public private partnerships, I put it to the Taoiseach there is a perception that the projects are stuck, that after four years in Government nothing in coming true that would suggest PPPs will build roads, bridges or tunnels. With regard to the public private partnerships that are being proposed to finance, design, construct and manage projects, will the Taoiseach confirm there is a problem with the financial side in so far as the typical proposal received suggests the investors would put in 10% of the cost and are seeking a 17% return on that&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to go through every responsibility of every Minister <Col N="200" /> under this question. The question before us is specifically about the progress made by the committee, not about the content of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. Any of the items I mentioned are merely for the Chair's information, to put my question in context so that the Taoiseach will understand the context in which I am putting the question. I am not asking him to answer those issues. I am providing the context and I am coming to my question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will rephrase my point. Given that the finance of public private partnerships depends ultimately on whether roads, tunnels and bridges are tolled and that the two main Dublin toll bridges are threatened with closure today, what is the Government&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is outside of the ambit of the question. The Deputy should stick to the precise nature of the question which is about the progress of the committee. The industrial dispute at the toll bridges is nothing to do with this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to accept the ruling of the Chair. That is the only way we can proceed. The Chair has ruled on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling. May I try again? I put it to the Taoiseach that he chairs a committee called the housing infrastructure and public private partnership committee. In the context of that committee, has it yet made progress on deciding&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions cannot be asked on what the committee decided or discussed, as that is a matter of Cabinet confidentiality. That is quite clear. Any question about what this committee discussed is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair told me I could ask what progress was being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy may ask a question about the progress made but not on what the committee discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to discuss but it makes progress. Does the Chair understand that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should accept the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it. I know the Chair has a difficult job with difficult Deputies like me. What progress has the Taoiseach made in resolving the <Col N="201" /> issue of whether it is Government policy to toll roads, tunnels and bridges which are built privately? Has he taken into account that for the first time in our history roads can be closed by industrial action and that that could not happen if tolls did not apply? What is the Government's position on tolling roads and has the committee made progress on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the two toll roads in question has been tolled for over 20 years &ndash; that toll system has run for 30 years &ndash; therefore there is nothing new in that regard. On the overall question, without saying what happened at meetings, there are 11 projects on roads, several projects on water schemes and several projects on sewerage schemes. There is a large amount of interest. I am not aware of any particular financing problem but I am sure if the Deputy wants to give information on that to me or to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, that Minister will certainly consider it.</P>
      <P>The first two road projects, the Waterford and Kilcock-Kinnegad projects, are at tendering stages and a number of other ones are at various stages of negotiations, including the Limerick ring road and the contract for the second Westlink bridge. The work on the Westlink bridge, which is one of the bridges to which the Deputy referred, commences this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the Government's drugs strategy announced last week. Will he explain what he has in mind when he refers to the additional allocation of gardaí to the areas most affected by the heroin problem? No doubt there is a huge demand for additional Garda resources in those areas. What scale of numbers is he talking about, what timescale does he have in mind and from where will these gardaí be drawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again it is a matter of detail but once the Taoiseach has mentioned it in his answer, he may clarify the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is set out in the strategy. It is to commence at the end of this year and it will be prioritised. The number of gardaí is growing &ndash; there are up to 12,000 gardaí at present. The intention is that gardaí who are taken off other security duties, those who are at present involved in Border duties on the foot and mouth disease issue, and new gardaí will be able to come back to some of these duties later in the year and that priority would be given in line with what the drugs strategy team is trying to do. The intention is that additional numbers &ndash; I cannot recall the numbers and the Deputy would need to table a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to find that out &ndash; would be assigned to these areas and that has been worked out on an operational basis with the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and for the Government's programme for Oireachtas reform. He also oversees preparation of the Government's legislative programme and has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office. I have no plans at present to extend the role and responsibilities of the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that Ministers of State at his Department in the past have played a useful role in co-ordinating across Departments certain areas of Government policies like European affairs? Will he also agree that there is a need for a Minister to co-ordinate immigrant affairs in the area of education, housing, social welfare, asylum seeking, anti-racism and xenophobia, many issues across Departments? Will he therefore agree that the Minister of State at his Department is ideally suited to such a co-ordinating role and, in the interests of proper integration of immigrants into the community&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;will he consider appointing a Minister of State or a Cabinet Minister &ndash; in this case I would suggest a Minister of State &ndash; to co-ordinate those issues in a proactive way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that useful work has been done in that area over recent years. The change in that regard occurred when the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which was designed to deal with this co-ordination role, was implemented. That has helped to initiate cross-departmental action. This happens in the area which has been mentioned. I chair the committee but the work of the committee is driven by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it includes representatives of other Departments and agencies involved in providing immigrant services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The needs of immigrants are sometimes common to Irish citizens from similar socio-economic backgrounds rather than to categories of non-nationals. Provision of services to immigrants is generally done as part of the mainstream provision of services and is not isolated. A Cabinet committee meets regularly and co-ordinates policy. The reception integration agency, the equality authority, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, a national consultative committee on racism and inter-culturalism and a public awareness programme, which was men<Col N="203" /> tioned in the House last week, are co-ordinated under the umbrella of that committee. Representatives of the various agencies sit on that committee. We have had a lot of work to do in the past few years because of the number of immigrants who have come here. This committee has provided a good framework with which to deal with the issues pertinent to non-nationals.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently announced the development of a new immigration policy. He has legislative measures in place and he will introduce further measures. In summary, the cross-departmental group on immigration works well. The public consultation process on immigration policy works well and further announcements will be made shortly. The committee has also co-ordinated a study of international legislation and practice with regard to immigration. The system works in a different manner than in the past and the Public Service Management Act, 1997, allows for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has forecast that another 300,000 immigrant workers will be required to meet the needs of the economy. Given the number of immigrants, including asylum seekers, already here, does the Taoiseach agree that it is likely that, in parts of Dublin for instance, the immigrant population will make up one in eight or one in ten of the population? It could be higher than that in some communities. This is a new development.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a great deal of racist and xenophobic comment being allowed go unchallenged? Does he agree there is a need for an overall body to take control of this? Some of the comments are dangerous and worrying. I ask the Taoiseach to consider putting a Minister or Minister of State in charge of co-ordinating these issues in a pro-active way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency for reception and integration is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A single committee consisting of Ministers, Ministers of State and officials co-ordinates the areas of housing, health and other areas. This arrangement works well. The racist and xenophobic comments to which the Deputy referred are a matter of concern. These incidents are increasing but not alarmingly so. Research shows that it is not a major issue but I am aware of an increasing number of cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister has set up and the Government has resourced a public awareness campaign with a budget to try to help the inclusive nature of the inter-cultural society. That committee and its programme has commenced. It is made up and driven by a high level steering group. It is representative of ethnic minorities, social partners, relevant departments and agencies and people with special interests in this area. It commenced its work this year and I have no doubt it will be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> My experience on this is that many of the issues for immigrants, who come from widely different backgrounds, such as social and economic difficulties need to be dealt with in common with Irish citizens who have the same problems. Rather than deal with people in inner cities and in marginalised communities as immigrants it is better that they are mainstreamed through the services. That does not apply in all cases but it does in health, housing and other areas. The Reception Integration Agency which has to be put on a statutory footing is already working and managing the service for asylum seekers, it is doing a good job and has built up an enormous core of staff dealing with the issue. That is the best way to proceed. In the meantime the service is working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the most effective way of mainstreaming asylum seekers is to give them the right to work, particularly those who have been here for more than six months and are still awaiting the outcome of the processing of their case? Arising from the Taoiseach's extensive reply when can we expect to see the tangible results of this working group on racism and the manifestation of the expenditure of the budget of the order of £4.5 million, which was decided and announced last October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The public awareness campaign of that committee has already commenced. It is a three year programme and has started in schools and communities. It has total independence. I have seen at least one of its presentations and I expect there will be more of them. The committee had to come to an agreement with the ethnic minority groups and the other groups on how it would handle this issue. It is working well. The whole idea is to try to address racism and promote a more inclusive inter-cultural society. Its work will continue indefinitely. On the issue of employment, the process is beginning to achieve the results. The difficulty was that it did not have enough staff. We have now put several hundred staff into the area of dealing with applications. The situation has improved greatly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these issues will continue to be addressed. Some of the people are involved in training schemes and in other programmes. Some of them are working anyway. That is an unsatisfactory position and an issue that has to be dealt with. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has given his views on that issue every time he has been on Question Time. The Reception Integration Agency and the public awareness campaign are helping to bed down this issue and to integrate immigrants into society.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 10 April to appoint Mr. Dermot Gallagher as Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs with effect from 7 July, when Mr. Padraic MacKernan is to relinquish the position. Mr. Gallagher is currently Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government took the opportunity to consider the current organisation of the Department of the Taoiseach and decided that, in the interest of the effective co-ordination and integration of the range of functions which that Department discharges, it would make sense to consolidate the posts of Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and Secretary General to the Government. Accordingly, Mr. Dermot McCarthy, who is currently Secretary General to the Government, is to assume the position of Sec<Col N="208" /> retary General of the Department of the Taoiseach upon Mr. Gallagher's transfer in July.</P>
    <P>It makes sense, particularly in a small Department like that of the Taoiseach which has only five assistant secretaries, to have a single administrative head with clear and unified lines of responsibility.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the importance of the Taoiseach's role in Northern Ireland, European and international affairs, the Government also decided on my recommendation to create a new post of Second Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for those matters. The Government has decided to appoint to this position Mr. Michael Collins, who is currently serving as Ambassador to the Czech Republic.</P>

The old Department of Economic Planning was abolished and its duties transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach, and the dual positions were established. It has been raised many times as being unsatisfactory by many of my predecessors over the years because there were two accounting officers and the lines of demarcation, or what sections were answerable for what, were not always clear. Now, Mr. McCarthy is Secretary General to the Government and will assume the position of Secretary General to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

Where did the issue of merging accounting officers arise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary General to the Government would not act in that role as accounting officer, but has always had other duties and functions. The present Secretary General to the Government also dealt with economic and social issues such as the Strategic Management Initiative and social partnership. He was answerable as accounting officer in these areas. The previous Secretary General, Mr. Frank Murray, had a number of duties other than his role as Secretary to the Government. This created difficulties for individuals during my period in office as well as during other periods evidently, as the matter was raised by my predecessors. The fact that Mr. Gallagher transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs provided an opportunity to deal with the issue which has been on the agenda for approximately 15 years.</P>

      <P>There was no installation cost of an SMS system in the Government Information Service.</P>
      <P>There is a limited Short Message Service (SMS) system operated by the Internet press officer assigned to the Government Press Office, which is occasionally used as a supplementary information service to the political correspondents and, from time to time, other interested media. It is an enhancement to the normal fax and e-mail services provided by the press office and incorporates the latest mobile phone technology, providing an efficient and cost effective, press information service.</P>
      <P>The recipients are, in the main, the political correspondents assigned to the press gallery at the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition to those a small number, approximately five other members of the media, have asked to be included in the SMS.</P>
      <P>The cost is 10p per message, which is a standard charge. On average the service is used once or twice per week, which would have a projected annual cost in the range of £78.00 to £208.00 for a 52 week service. For example, the total cost of the messaging service for the first quarter of this year from 1 January 2001 to 31 March 2001 was £36.30.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last February I received a request for a meeting from the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) to discuss the benchmarking process and other unspecified matters. My office replied to this request on 28 February indicating that benchmarking was being addressed at the appropriate forum and that discussions on other matters coming within RACO's remit should be pursued within the conciliation and arbitration structures that had been set up precisely for this purpose. In March and April, I received further requests for a meeting which indicated that an agenda was being prepared by the association. However, I have not yet received any indication of the issues they wish to discuss with me.</P>
      <P>Representation was introduced in the Defence Forces in 1990 to provide members of the Defence Forces with an input into matters of concern to them. Under the representation arrangements, a range of fora are available to the associations, ranging from forum meetings with the military authorities to the conciliation and arbitration scheme with a council and various sub-committees which meet on a regular basis. The representative associations and the conciliation and arbitration branch also have ongoing contact with each other by means of written correspondence and phone communication.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the system of representation, with its conciliation and arbitration scheme, provides the association with an adequate platform for the presentation of its views to my Department and to the military authorities. I am satisfied that all issues currently on hand are appropriate to, and can be dealt with, through these structures.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that he has not had direct meetings with the representative associations of commissioned officers or RACO since November 2000 when he attended their annual general meeting? Does the Minister agree he has not had personal meetings with them because he has been sulking for six months now, due to the criticism voiced at that meeting of his failure to deliver on promises he made to them at their annual general meeting in 1996 and his failure to give reasonable consideration to the very comprehensive document presented by RACO to the Minister to contribute towards the White Paper on Defence? Does the Minister acknowledge that he and civil servants in his Department have not been willing to attend meetings and have not held any such meetings since November? If the agenda which the Minister now says is outstanding is furnished to him, detailing specific issues of concern directly relevant to the Defence Forces which RACO wishes to discuss with him, will he arrange such a meeting?</P>

Since that time, with East Timor, Kosovo and Sarajevo, we have been at a peak of our involvement in overseas missions.

In tandem with that, I have arranged to devolve to the military authorities up to 70% of the non-pay area, so they have complete authority in those areas. Deputy Shatter is missing out on the significance of the changes that have taken place.</P>
      <P>Finally, on conciliation and arbitration, I expect RACO to tell me what its agenda is if it wishes to meet me. So far, it has not done that.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that decommissioned mortars were rejected by the ISPAT plant in Cobh, County Cork, due to the level of radioactive contamination, the Defence Forces have undertaken an audit to identify weapons or materials that may present a similar hazard; the location where the rejected material is stored; the plans for its future storage; if new guidelines have been issued for the safe disposal of such materials; if he will ensure personnel are not exposed to unnecessary risk; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The decommissioning of old mortars took place in 1999. The mortars, 200 in all, were purchased from Brandt, a French company, in the period 1936 to 1955.</P>
      <P>On the recommendation of a military board of survey, the mortars were converted to scrap in Clancy Barracks in Dublin. The scrapped mortars were removed to the Irish Steel plant, ISPAT, in Haulbowline, County Cork in October 1999 for reprocessing.</P>
      <P>When the scrapped mortars arrived in the Irish Steel plant, the radiation detection alarm on the premises was activated. Irish Steel, as required by law, alerted the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the scrap was not accepted.</P>
      <P>A technical expert from the RPII was requested to investigate the source and extent of the radiation and to advise on procedures. He identified the source of the radiation as the radionuclides, radium 226 and radium 228. The radium is found in the luminous strip on the cross levelling bubble located on the bipod of the mortar. It is understood that wrist watches which were manufactured around the same period were luminised with similar radioactive material.</P>
      <P>The RPII has stated that a person would have to be in very close proximity to the illuminating bubble of a mortar stand for a minimum of 4,000 hours to be subjected to the safe allowable annual amount of radiation. Taking into account the level of usage of this type of equipment in the Defence Forces, it is impossible for members of the Defence Forces to be subjected to anything near to the safe allowable annual amount of radiation.</P>
      <P>The task of isolating those cut mortar bipod sections which were radioactive was undertaken by ordnance personnel on 19 October 1999. All personnel involved were adequately protected using disposable overalls, face masks, gloves and personal dosimeters. The non-radioactive scrap was handed over to Irish Steel for reprocessing. The isolated segments were returned to Clancy Barracks in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The isolated radioactive segments are stored in steel bins in Clancy Barracks in a special radioac<Col N="214" /> tive materials storage facility. This facility is constructed in accordance with international requirements for the storage of such items and comes under the RPII for audit and inspections. The material will remain in this facility until a new one is built in the new Defence Forces logistics base in the Curragh. The facility is operated in accordance with RPII guidelines. Should the RPII guidelines change, the military authorities will update their instructions as required.</P>
    <P>It is mandatory for the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to maintain a register and inventory of all radioactive substances and to be licensed by the RPII in that regard. The Department and the Defence Forces meet all the requirements of the RPII in that regard. The Defence Forces has carried out a full audit of the ordnance materials and systems under its control and none presents any hazard from radiation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept, notwithstanding his detailed reply, that it seems extraordinary that the Defence Forces were not aware of the presence of the radioactive contamination before assigning military and civilian personnel to cut the weapons with blowtorches prior to dispatch to Haulbowline? Does he accept the personnel involved should not have been asked to undertake this task without being made aware of the safety implications?</P>

      <P>On the basis of the information available to me any activities of that kind conducted by the Defence Forces are carried out under the strictest regulations. As I indicated in my reply, the information from the RPII is that an individual would have to be exposed for an extraordinary length of time to come any way close to the allowable radiation levels. The information from the Defence Forces was that there was no risk and no hazard involved to the individuals concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the RPII was asked to prepare a report of the incident in Clancy Barracks. The safety committee in the barracks was not informed of its contents or of the details of the report. Will the Minister arrange for the report to be made available to the safety committee in Clancy Barracks? The Minister may be satisfied there is no problem but the personnel who were involved are concerned. Will the Minister arrange medical checks for the personnel involved to reassure them that their health has not been compromised? Furthermore, will he outline the steps he or the Defence Forces propose to take to ensure the safest and most effective disposal for the future? In his reply he said that the items, now in Clancy Barracks, would be dispatched to the Curragh. Personnel in the Curragh will be concerned. The matter should be clarified and all the facts made known.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, on 15 July 1998 the Government approved a programme of evacuation and the sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment, and re-equipment of the Defence Forces as recommended in the context of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally.</P>
      <P>It is expected that in excess of £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks. Most of the proceeds will be invested in the re-development of other military installations and new equipment.</P>
      <P>There are in addition a number of other lands including Gormanston within the Defence portfolio which are located outside of the permanently occupied military barracks and posts. Casement Aerodrome is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided, in line with the White Paper on Defence, that a rigorous examination of the necessity for other property be examined and only those required for essential defence purposes will be retained. Those identified will be disposed of by sale or otherwise and the Government has approved that the proceeds, along with the revenue from the existing programme of barrack disposals, will be invested in the Defence Forces infrastructure and equipment.</P>

It is a lengthy, complex report containing wide ranging and far reaching recommendations on public service pensions. When publishing it, the Minister for Finance noted the commission's view that its recommendations represent an integrated, cohesive long-term strategy for public pensions and that in implementing it, it is important to preserve the integrity of the whole package.

      <P>It is not in any way unusual for pay increases to be paid after the due date as I am sure the majority of Deputies will know.

      <P>The Defence Forces personnel support service provides comprehensive pre-retirement courses for personnel who are due to retire on age grounds from the Defence Forces. The content and issues covered in these courses are kept under review on an ongoing basis and the reaction to the courses by retiring members is very positive. While the actual percentage uptake of such pre-retirement courses is not readily available, the military authorities have advised that the attendance on these courses is generally very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More generally, the Defence Forces are continuing to develop and run a wide and diverse range of in-service training courses for serving members which meet both the needs of the organisation for specialist resources and provide serving personnel with valuable and recognised <Col N="221" /> qualifications and skills. The acquisition of recognised qualifications and applicable vocational skills has facilitated access to excellent opportunities in civilian life following service in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>In the context of retired members of the Defence Forces, I am advised that recently retired officers are being denied entry into the reserve. Why is that, or has that changed in recent weeks? Surely, the reserve would greatly benefit from the experience and expertise of recently retired officers and it is a means of maintaining their involvement in a constructive way with the Defence Forces to the benefit of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter &ndash; I think the opposite is the position. With so many developments in terms of employment opportunities, we are stretched to try to maintain our numbers in the FCA. I have made some changes so that specialist personnel, in particular, who are in short supply in some areas can now join the FCA. A number have joined and become actively involved. I will double-check the position in regard to some officers who have retired. Even though we are carrying out a review and a number of issues will obviously be left aside for the time being, it would greatly surprise me if somebody who had served in the Defence Forces on a permanent basis was refused admission to the FCA. I will check it. I would like to have the particulars so that I can give the Deputy a more definite reply. It would greatly surprise me as it is totally at odds with what I hear everywhere else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> Does the Minister agree that, in the context of the difficulties with numbers in the Defence Forces, we should, as he said, encourage those who have retired to involve themselves in the reserve? Will the Minister assure the House that if there are still difficulties in this area, as there were some weeks ago, he will have them addressed? Will he respond to me on that issue by way of correspondence if he does not have the information immediately?</P>

      <Quest>the steps which have been taken to date to honour those who died in the Niemba ambush in the Congo; if there are plans to further honour the survivors of the ambush; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Defences Forces and the State honours, and will continue to honour, the memory and recognise the sacrifice of the men who died in the service of peace at Niemba or in any other theatre of UN operations. In this regard, all deceased members of the Defence Forces are commemorated in the annual Mass for deceased members which takes place at all garrison churches in November and by the Government and the people at the National Day of Commemoration held at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, in July each year.</P>
      <P>A commemorative plaque was unveiled by the President at Arbour Hill Church on 8 November 1961, the first anniversary of the Niemba ambush. This plaque now contains the names of all those killed in the Congo. On 2 November 1970, three memorial tablets were unveiled at the Army and UN plots in Glasnevin cemetery. One of the tablets honours the personnel of the Defence Forces who served with United Nations peacekeeping forces and on the kerbing at the foot of the tablets are inscribed the names of all those who died in the Congo.</P>
      <P>A Niemba memorial was also unveiled at Cathal Brugha Barracks on 5 November 1983 dedicated to those who died in the ambush. The memorial was funded and erected by their compatriots in the 33rd Infantry Battalion. The memorial is in the form of a marble sculpture set in tiered flower beds with a plaque to the front in which the names of those killed are inscribed. Surviving members of the 33rd Infantry Battalion attend a wreath-laying ceremony annually at this memorial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 June 1998, at a ceremony in Collins Barracks, Dublin, I was pleased to award an Réalt Mileata, the military star medal, to the next of kin of those who died at Niemba. There are not any plans at present to further honour those who died at Niemba. The current number of ceremon<Col N="223" /> ies and memorials is felt to be appropriate and adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining in detail the recognition that has been given to the soldiers who died or survived the events at Niemba. It was felt it might be appropriate to have another event but, given the Minister's response this afternoon, I would be happy with an assurance that all of the remaining survivors would be invited each year to the event he mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the views expressed by some of the survivors, will the Minister ensure that they are invited in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the military authorities go to great lengths to ensure that relatives are invited. It is one of the great sacrifices the Defence Forces make in the service of peace in different parts of the world that so many have been killed and that so much tragedy has been wrought on their families. One of the reasons we have not considered taking steps to further honour the survivors of the Niemba ambush is that it would be unfair to single them out and exclude those who were killed in Elizabethville in the Congo or in South Lebanon. We are trying to be fair across the board. However, I assure the Deputy that we will recheck what we have been doing up to now and make sure that any relative who could have been left out, unwittingly or for whatever reason, will be included in the future. If Deputy Ryan has any relevant information, he might pass it on to me. It might be of help to the military authorities who are engaged in a fairly exhaustive check. I have discussed this matter with successive chiefs of staff. This is one thing that, from a humane perspective, it is important we do well because, more than anybody else, these families have paid a high price.</P>

On the day the Réalt Mileata was presented to the surviving families, which included him and others, we had a brief discussion about what else could be done. On the basis of the information available from the military authorities, everything that was feasible was undertaken.</P>

However, an audit has been done for the Department, and I am prepared to furnish such particulars to the Deputy. It is my intention to carry out an exacting exercise on the total property portfolio. A number of properties in Galway, Cork and elsewhere have been sold for quite significant sums, all of which are being dedicated to the purposes outlined here. These projects can go ahead because of the change in policy on the sale and disposal of these properties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmins usually tries to be serious in this House, but he is laughing now because he knows some of these properties should have been disposed of a long time ago. The advantage is that now we will have full use of the funds to develop the Defence Forces, as was not hitherto the position. I do not envisage any future Minister for Finance purchasing lands anywhere in the country.</P>

      <P>Training is a very important component of military activities, and we must ensure there are adequate facilities for it. When I first visited the Curragh Camp, I was quite ashamed by what I found. However, the camp has been transformed and is now our main training centre. The new facilities have enhanced the camp significantly. Much of what we are doing enhances the training capacity and provides for different kinds of buildings, facilities and equipment. In cases where the disposal of property would impinge on training, the military authorities bring forward alternative proposals. I am not disposing of property if the long-term needs of the Defence Forces in terms of financial resources and training requirements cannot be satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The Towards 2000 Programme for Civil Defence which was launched in 1992 consisted of 12 development activities designed to focus the organisation to better serve the needs of the local community. These included stewarding; providing an enhanced search and rescue capability; river, lake and coastal area search and recovery; major and radiological emergencies and environmental problems; flooding, blizzards and forest fire-fighting problems and evacuee reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> Following the success of that programme, local authority Civil Defence elements were asked to submit an ongoing development plan in line with their local requirements and this process was given major impetus in February of last year with the introduction of the White Paper on Defence. The White Paper committed the Government to providing the necessary infrastructure and training to enable the Civil Defence to continue to develop its capacity to respond to emergencies as a high quality second line emergency service and facilitate community support activities while preserving the voluntary nature and ethos of the organisation.</P>
    <P>As a signal of its intent in that regard the Government committed an additional £500,000 to the Civil Defence budget for 2000 and beyond. In addition to the staffing costs of the Department's Civil Defence branch, total expenditure by the Department in 2001 will be about £3.2 million and this level of expenditure on Civil Defence is expected to be maintained over the period to 2004.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to providing the necessary framework for the future development of Civil Defence by modernising the legislation governing Civil Defence by means of a new Civil Defence Bill which will be published shortly together with additional measures to assist with the recruitment of new members to Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>There are 41 authorised Civil Defence officers in the organisation. These consist of 34 full-time and seven part-time officers. Of these 41 officers, seven are female, one of whom is part-time.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence organisation is administered on the basis of local authority areas rather than on a county or city basis and there are 32 local authority administrative areas. At present there are approximately 6,000 active volunteers in the organisation and some 3,000 trained persons who are no longer active but are available for emergencies. On the basis of the most recent available figures, the gender balance within the organisation breaks down fairly evenly between male and female members.</P>
    <P>The total value of equipment supplied by the Department to local authorities for Civil Defence purposes for the past five years amounts to almost £3.5 million as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Civil Defence on its efforts during the recent floods, when it did fantastic work. A great concern over the years has been the need for equipment to be updated. <Col N="228" /> Is the Minister of State satisfied that, given the increased finance available, there is enough funding to upgrade the ambulance and transport fleet, which is a matter of major concern?</P>
      <P>Also, has a decision been taken on the future use of Ratra House when the Civil Defence has been relocated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Ryan in paying tribute to the Civil Defence for its great work over the years. I know he will join me in complimenting it on its work in preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease recently. The Civil Defence was out in force for about two months taking part in the disinfection procedures and stewarding. It provided support for other services for those two or three months of more than 2,000 man hours in total. We owe the Civil Defence a debt of gratitude for standing in the breach and we should salute it, as it was an essential part of preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease here. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to say that.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been taken on Ratra House. No new use for the building has been decided yet. The equipment budget for this year is £1,046,000, which is a considerable increase on previous years. In 1996 it was £619,000, in 1997 it was £635,000, in 1998 it was £661,000, in 1999 it was £530,000 and in 2000 it was £1,046,000. That is a total of £3,491,000. That does include the ambulances to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the role of the Civil Defence in monitoring fall-out from nuclear explosions such as that in Chernobyl or any possible accident at Sellafield? Is he satisfied the Civil Defence has the necessary equipment to monitor such fall-out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why we are bringing in new Civil Defence legislation. The organisation's existing duties date back to 1946 legislation and 1939 air raid precautions. The role of the Civil Defence has evolved substantially over the years and it no longer sees itself as primarily having to respond to nuclear situations. Its role has broadened considerably, as we saw in the recent foot and mouth crisis, while there are other agencies which carry out the technical measurement of radiation, such as the energy boards, rather than the Civil Defence. Its job is not so much measurement of radiation but responding to an emergency once one is identified. That is its role rather than one of strict measurement.</P>

      <P>By 30 April 2001 a total of 15,705 claims had been received by my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. Of these claims, 255 have been the subject of court awards, 7,862 have been disposed of through out of court settlements, 384 were either withdrawn by plaintiffs or dismissed by the courts and 7,204 are still outstanding.</P>
      <P>Following the December 1999 judgment of the Supreme Court in the Hanley Army hearing loss case, my Department, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Law Society of Ireland established an early settlement scheme &ndash; ESS &ndash; to deal with the outstanding Army hearing loss litigation claims. The scheme operated successfully on a pilot basis in 2000 and 1,098 claims were settled by direct negotiation between solicitors representing plaintiffs and officials of the Chief State Solicitor's office and my Department.</P>
      <P>Given the success of the pilot scheme, my Department expanded the ESS in January 2001. Five firms of liability loss adjusters have been engaged to expand the capacity of the scheme and to augment the resources of the Chief State Solicitor's office in conducting settlement negotiations. The scheme has continued to operate successfully. By 30 April 2001 a further 743 claims had been resolved, while I understand that settlements have been agreed with plaintiffs' solicitors in a further 250 cases. In addition, negotiations are ongoing or due to commence on a further 1,200 claims.</P>
      <P>In this regard, it is my Department's policy to resolve the vast majority of outstanding claims under the scheme. Many hundreds of plaintiffs throughout the country have had their claims resolved at fair levels of compensation under the scheme, with significant savings to the Exchequer in court costs. While some claims will continue to be listed for hearing in court, I am hopeful that the early settlement scheme will continue to operate successfully and that the vast majority of the outstanding claims will be resolved in this way.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that six years ago, when hearing impairment claims first became an issue, he mentioned an average cost of £35,000. Is the Minister aware that this figure has been reduced to about £7,600 and will he comment on the figure? Given the need to resolve this issue in a satisfactory manner and as quickly as possible, will the Minister com<Col N="232" /> ment on the fact that it seems more and more cases are going to court rather than being settled out of court?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of what is happening. It was originally estimated that the total cost of hearing impediment claims would be about £1.25 billion, based on the amounts being awarded by the courts or agreed out of court. The figure has now been substantially reduced to an average of £7,600 and the overall cost is now estimated to be between £250 million and £300 million. This represents a substantial decrease on what otherwise would have been an extraordinary burden on the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. It is not true to say that most cases are going to court, as the figures I have given have demonstrated.</P>
      <P>The out of court settlement scheme is working very satisfactorily. Up to 1 April last, 701 cases were dealt with, offers were made in 250 cases and a number of other cases are developing. We hope the bulk of remaining cases will be settled out of court and that fewer will go to court and thereby incur additional costs on the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The Department cannot be certain when this matter will end. I estimate that it will take about two years to clear the bulk of outstanding cases, looking at the figures with which we are now faced. If the current scheme continues to work and there are no big changes, we are ambitious that the number of cases will be reduced to an insignificant level. Before the agreement on the out of court settlement scheme, legal costs represented 30% of costs. In cases dealing with a quantum of £35,000, one had to add a further £16,000 to include overall legal and court costs.</P>

Bed shortages <Col N="236" /> mean that patients are being denied life saving treatment. Services for children are woefully inadequate. The Government cannot agree on what to do next.

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred to these matters recently and about that necessity, but legislation on it is not currently before the Govern<Col N="239" /> ment. The Minister indicated that in dealing with cases in the future, such as the Abbeylara case, we will have to move from the position we had. The Government will have to consider how that will best be done, on the far side of the investigations currently before the House and cases we will have to deal with.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach seems to be misinformed as to what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said. He rejected proposals for a legislatively based independent complaints system. Is it the Government's position that for as long as it lasts in office we will have to wait until we are dragged before the court in Strasbourg, given that our system is at variance with the findings of the judgment? Is it correct to assume that the Government is not prepared to bring forward legislation which would provide for an independent complaints board or procedures for citizens who have complaints against the Garda, and that we would remove the current system where the gardaí investigate complaints against themselves by themselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by thanking Deputies for their support for the Bill and for their contributions to the debate on Second Stage. I will try to deal with as many of the points raised as I can.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the aim of the Bill is to provide, where necessary, for the replacement of Irish pound amounts in law with convenient amounts in euro to apply from 1 January 2002. Taken together with other similar measures, such as those in the Finance and Social Welfare Acts, the Bill should broadly complete what might be called the euro price list for the more common transactions between the citizen and the State. Amounts that are not dealt with by the various pieces of national legislation will of course be converted to euro, at the conversion rate, by the relevant EU regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell and McDowell referred to concerns that the changeover might affect prices. As I mentioned previously, the consumer aspects of the changeover are being addressed by the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs and the Director of Consumer Affairs. They relaunched the national code of practice on the euro changeover last December, along with an <Col N="246" /> action plan for consumer protection. A key aspect of the code is that subscribers to the code commit themselves to carry out the changeover fairly and to seek no advantage from the conversion.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has sent the national code to more than 200 organisations, inviting them and their members to subscribe to that code or to draw up a suitable sectoral code for approval under the national code. Any approved code would have to contain the same commitment about carrying out the changeover fairly. Retailers who have signed up to the code or to an approved sectoral code will be entitled to display a euro logo, and the Director of Consumer Affairs will be advising consumers to shop where they see that logo. In addition, of course, before the euro comes in, consumers will have had ample opportunity to inform themselves on the changeover and to build up a scale of values in euro. Dual display of prices is already fairly visible in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy McDowell's suggestion that euro amounts should perhaps take the lead in some cases, though of course Ireland is unique in the euro area in that here, prices in euro look bigger than prices in national currency. I expect dual display here to increase over the coming months, and especially from 1 October 2001, the date by which subscribers to the national and sectoral codes are committed to introducing it.</P>
    <P>The take-up of services in euro, which are already available, for example, from banks and from the Revenue Commissioners, should also be increasing. Deputies McDowell and Fleming referred to ATMs. I understand that about 80% of ATMs will change over on 1 January 2002, and the remainder will follow within a few days. Initially they will issue predominantly 10 and 20 euro notes, so as to help put low-denomination notes into circulation from the start. Deputy Mitchell suggested that we have a three month changeover period. I am afraid I could not accept this suggestion. All the euro member states are committed to a changeover period of two months or less. The period we have chosen strikes a fair balance between giving people time to adapt to the new money and getting the changeover completed in a reasonably speedy way.</P>
    <P>The changeover will be carried out by financial institutions converting accounts to euro on 1 January 2002; from then on, cash going outwards will be in euro, while Irish cash coming inwards will be retained. An important part of this process is that while retailers will continue to accept Irish cash up to 9 February, they will charge only in euro and will give change only in euro.</P>
    <P>To do this, retailers will have to get euro cash from banks in advance of 1 January 2002, and will have to lodge the Irish cash they receive inwards during the dual circulation period. It is to facilitate this process that it has been agreed to meet part &ndash; and only part &ndash; of the income that banks would otherwise obtain from retailers through cash handling charges on euro cash provided <Col N="247" /> before 1 January, and on Irish cash lodged during the dual circulation period. In return, banks will waive those charges for retailers. Banks will of course be meeting their own costs in the changeover.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked if section 5 of the Bill would impact on the value of shares for credit union members. Section 5 redefines a share in a credit union as 1, in place of £1. The value of each individual's shareholding &ndash; that is, the amount of money in his or her account &ndash; will be converted to euro at the conversion rate. The answer to the Deputy's question is that the value of a person's shareholding will not be affected by the redefinition of a share.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also asked what would happen about elderly people, in particular, who have Irish cash on hands after 9 February 2002. Financial institutions will continue to provide cash exchange as set out in the cash changeover plan, and to accept Irish cash in customer lodgements, for a time after 9 February. The Central Bank will give value indefinitely for Irish notes and coins. However, I am sure the Deputy would join me in urging people, and elderly people in particular, not to keep large quantities of cash on hands at any time.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell expressed concern about the level of preparedness and general awareness of the changeover both as regards businesses and the public. While I would not accept his view of how we compare with other euro member states, I do agree with him that companies need to accelerate their preparations considerably from now on, and that public information efforts will need to be intensified in the run-up to 1 January.</P>
    <P>A number of important initiatives will be launched on the public awareness front in the autumn. The European Central Bank will unveil the security features of the euro notes at the end of August, and they and the appearance of the notes will be widely advertised from then on. The Euro Changeover Board will increase its advertising campaign substantially from September onwards and will also distribute a booklet on the changeover to every household. Extensive dual display of prices will begin from 1 October. Starter packs of euro coins will be put on sale, mainly at post offices, from 17 December. There will be lots of activity aimed at making sure everyone is ready for the changeover when it begins on 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked about the changeover to euro operation by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I can report that since 1 January 1999, Revenue has offered its business customers the facility to conduct their revenue affairs either in Irish pounds or in euro during the transitional period. Revenue have put together a comprehensive changeover plan across all their operations and they are confident they will be fully ready for the changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>Work is also well in hand in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Cus<Col N="248" /> tomers receiving payments by order books will have books spanning the changeover period well in advance of the change. Customers receiving their payments by cheque, by direct credit to bank etc. accounts or on presenting their social services card at their local post office, will be paid in euro on their first pay day in 2002.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the budget day report. He may be confusing issues arising from the euro changeover with other issues that have to do with the alignment of the tax and calendar years from 1 January next. Arising from the decision on the latter, the Government decided that from next year, social welfare increases will also take effect from 1 January. The next budget on 5 December 2001 will provide for these increases. For logistical reasons, however, they will not be paid on time in all cases, though in any case where there is delay all arrears due will be paid in February effective from 1 January. This has nothing to do with the euro changeover, the delay in implementing the budget changes is solely due to timing considerations. Given the choice between April implementation on time, and January implementation with some delay, the Government chose the latter. I believe our choice was correct.</P>
    <P>Preparations for the changeover to the euro are already extensive and they are gathering pace. A great deal of work has already been done in the legislative field, and this Bill marks a further step in those preparations. Although a technical Bill, it incorporates an important principle &ndash; that the changeover should favour the citizen where convenience demands that there must be a departure from mutual conversion. The Bill is a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to making timely preparations for the changeover and in that sense it sets a good example for the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. - Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I express the appreciation of the whole agricultural community of the efforts of the Minister, his staff, the Garda and the Defence <Col N="249" /> Forces during the recent foot and mouth disease crisis. Their efforts have prevented a catastrophic situation arising so far as this country is concerned and they should be commended. Despite the recent relaxation in animal movement and the reopening of livestock sales I ask the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to review the position at an early date as the new regulations are posing major problems in some areas, especially in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we will now have an independent appeals system for dealing with problems concerning payment of agricultural grants. Down through the years the Department has done its utmost to try to treat farmers as fairly as possible but in some cases many of us have considered that some farmers have been harshly treated regarding grant refusals and the penalties imposed.</P>
      <P>Given the proposals in the Bill, all the various schemes operated by the Department will come under the auspices of the new appeals board. It is important that the independence of the appeals board be beyond question. Whoever is appointed as director general and the various appeals officers would have to be autonomous. The director should come from outside the present Agriculture House system. That is not to denigrate anybody within it, but if independence is to be maintained the director and those who will take strategic policy decisions should be totally independent and not have any pre-fixed ideas as might be the case with somebody who had already been involved within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Everybody accepts that the appeals system operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is fair and totally transparent. The proposed new appeals system will deal with agricultural grant problems and where difficulties arise with issuing various licences by the Department it will become the arbitration medium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speed will be of the essence. We do not want a situation where appeal cases take 12 or 18 months to process. In some cases appeals have been ongoing for two or three years. The Department is not always at fault. In some cases it is at fault but in others the applicant is at fault. That a time limit is to be placed on the processing time will ensure everybody prepares their cases properly and quickly and that a fair tribunal of inquiry can take place. The facility for oral hearings is important. In some cases applicants may need the assistance of a third party. It will be open to them, under the new appeals system, to take along whomever they wish to help prove their case. Some people have a fear of going into examinations such as this. An appeals system which did not allow for third party representation would be wrong. It is imperative that third party representation for the applicant be allowed. That the Department will have to make available to the applicant all documents regarding the case is important. If all documents were not made available, such as is made available with regard to <Col N="250" /> court proceedings, the applicant could be ambushed at the appeal hearing by the departmental officials coming in with new documents which it may not be possible to answer on the spot and the appeal could be lost.</P>
    <P>The appeals officers will have to adhere to tight procedural guidelines. They will be able to consider all documentation. An individual's history could be important and all dealings the Department has had with individuals down through the years should be made available to the appeals system. There are records on every farmer. If somebody, for some unknown reason, makes a mistake and is penalised it will be found on checking that it is a genuine mistake. In the past, most of the problems with people who have been in default have been with those who have been in continuous default. The number of persons who have had one off cases that have not been fairly examined by the Department has been limited. It is imperative that the independence of the appeals system is maintained. The decision process must be speedy and accurate. Given that so much of a farmer's income is derived from subsidy payments and various national and EU schemes, they depend on it for cashflow and for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The new appeals system will be responsible also for dealing with appeals in regard to various licences. I hope there will be discretion for those with problems. If people need extra time to resolve problems with various licences I hope it will be allowed. I hope that where extra time is needed to improve buildings or handling facilities it will be allowed. It would be unfair to give, say, a month's notice to carry out some major improvement work for handling facilities. There should be minimum and maximum periods within which work, as recommended after an appeal, should be carried out.</P>
    <P>This is a positive move in regard to agriculture and the agricultural industry. I hope the independence of appeals officers will be maintained at all times. The best way to maintain that independence is to appoint a director for the new body from outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Ellis I am happy the foot and mouth disease problem is well under control. I concur with his recognition of the Minister, his staff, the Garda and everyone else concerned. There are individual complaints and I will comment on them later. In general there has been a tremendous national effort by everybody, including the football groups and many others who sacrificed so much. It was the first time in years that the importance of the agriculture industry, and especially the livestock sector, was recognised by everybody. All those people deserve congratulations, including the Minister. We recognise it was a traumatic time and that there was much pressure on everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are still major problems I want to mention. The permits system for the sale of livestock, which starts today, is a major improve<Col N="251" /> ment. We should not get too deeply involved in technicalities. Some of the regulations that are being introduced are excessive and will prove very difficult to police. However, individuals might get caught on minor technicalities. When we bring in orders or legislation we need to ensure that they are workable and capable of being policed and we need to follow through on them.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ellis said, we need to get marts operating normally as quickly as possible. My colleagues and I fully supported the Minister's decision to close the marts in the short term. However, there is not the expertise among farmers that there was some 30 or 40 years ago, when animals were bought and sold in marts or at the houses. Many people are asking that a means for weighing cattle should be found so that they could have a better idea of the valuation. I thought the changeover today would ease many of the worries but in recent days, the feedback has been otherwise.</P>
    <P>As the Ceann Comhairle is in the House, I have a small gripe. I put down a question about the failure to file forms FMD 5 and 7 by departmental staff at local offices in recent days. This question was not allowed because it was part of a question down for the Minister in Adjournment Debate Matters last week. I put it down because it was not answered on the Adjournment. It was suggested by the Minister for State that the Teagasc offices could deal with these permits. The information was certainly not correct in the answer given last Thursday.</P>
    <P>While I understand the system has worked itself out because of the new structures, it is important that answers to questions in this House are made truthfully and properly. The statement from the Minister says: &ldquo;both of which are issued by the Teagasc offices&rdquo;. This refers to forms FMD 5 and 7 dealing with the transfer of closed herds and bulls, sheep and pigs on farms. This is an example of the Minister's officials not getting it correct. They were talking about the appeals system. Farmers, whose livelihood is at stake, have the right to appeal to ensure that the income to which they are entitled is given back to them if a mistake is made. In this case, it was the Department that made a major mistake and nobody, including the Minister and his officials, will suffer any loss of wages for a week, a day or even an hour. Yet farmers, who make any mistake in forms, can lose up to two years' income. Everybody is entitled to fair play and that was a very serious issue that resolved itself through different means but caused many problems to the individual farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>The topic we are discussing today is extremely serious. To most farmers the headage premiums, area aid, REPs etc. can often mean 50% or more of their income and in a year like this one it could be 100%. I welcome the Bill and agree with its general objectives. I know that farm organisations <Col N="252" /> and the farming community will be happy to see these arrangements in place.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives a statutory basis to a formal appeals process. The Minister states that it will be similar to the social welfare appeals process. However, it will be in the Department and will not be an outside body or office. Can the Minister explain his reluctance to establish an independent office? It was interesting to hear his colleague say that it should be totally independent of the Department and it should have someone from outside the Department as its principal.</P>
    <P>Farmers would like to see a truly independent body. We are glad that civil servants from outside the Department are allowed to be part of it. However, why can people from outside the Civil Service not become members of this body? There are people in Teagasc and other qualified personnel involved in this area who should form part of the composition of the body. To use Deputy Ellis's words it should not be answerable to any of our friends in the Department. This is extremely important and should be considered.</P>
    <P>I worry about how these people will be appointed. We had the debacle over the appointment of valuers to buy TB infected cattle etc. Although many people applied, some were not even given the courtesy of an interview simply because they may have been farmers in their own right. A dealer, a mart manager, auctioneers and other people were allowed to apply and got jobs; I wish them well. I have failed to get any explanation from the Department about the selection process. We have to be very careful about who is appointed to this very important appeals body.</P>
    <P>Recently senior vets from my area were twice asked to apply for promotion and yet the jobs were filled without them being interviewed. These appointments must be above reproach. I welcome the general concept of the appeals body. People will get the chance to have their cases reviewed. In the past many people felt very aggrieved.</P>
    <P>I do not have time for people who deliberately cheat the system. However a farmer should not be punished for some minor technicality if it can be shown clearly that he has made a genuine mistake. There have been examples of selling cattle a couple of days before their time or not having properly advised the two or three different offices of the death of an animal as farmers think that if they make notification once it should be sufficient. It is totally unacceptable that these people should lose their total payments for one or even two years. I hope the appeals body will recognise this issue. It is important that people from farm organisations or Teagasc or even politicians can accompany farmers or farm families to these appeals. This has happened in social welfare appeals and has been very beneficial. The oral hearing in this context is very important and welcome. However, under the Bill if the result of the oral hearing is not accepted, the only court to which one can go is the High Court. What farmer can afford to take this route? It is an impossibility <Col N="253" /> for farmers and I ask that this provision be re-examined as a matter of urgency. In recent times we have heard of High Court cases costing £2 million, but at a minimum it costs a couple of thousand pounds to even employ a junior barrister. The system as set out cannot work and is impossible.</P>
    <P>The appeals system will cover a very large range of areas, including area aid, headage and premium payments, the national beef assurance scheme and the provisions regarding dealers which were brought in through emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>I and the Minister visited some of the Border checkpoints and the disease centres at Ballymascanlan and Clontibret. These centres were set up at very short notice and allowed the operators to bring down all the area aid maps so that those who wished could examine them. With modern technology there is no reason area aid maps are not available at centres throughout the country. It would mean farmers and their advisers, be they independent advisers or from Teagasc, could discuss any discrepancies or problems. Many of the problems which will have to be dealt with through appeals could be dealt with at that level as it is obvious from what I and the Minister saw at the emergency offices that first class information can be made available at very short notice. In terms of penalties, the provision of maps locally would solve the problems which farmers, particularly older farmers, have in reading maps.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of a time limit, but from talking even with banks in the context of foot and mouth disease, some people would like to see the appeals process being dealt with in less than 12 weeks. However, I welcome that this mandatory period is set out as a maximum.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legislation concerning dealers, as did some of the Minister's colleagues our party met representatives of dealers in recent days. They are very worried that while the legislation went through the Dáil some time ago, it is very difficult to get licences, and it is necessary to ensure this problem is dealt with as quickly as possible. Even when the marts re-open they will have a role to play in trying to get markets for our cattle, for example, in Lebanon, where I understand there is a possibility of markets now, and in other places such as Spain and the wider European market. It is vital that some of these problems are addressed.</P>
    <P>On EU pension schemes and the associated paperwork, if there is even a slight problem with the paperwork, it is all sent back by registered post to the person concerned. In light of foot and mouth disease, and the delays in this regard, it is unfair that this issue is dealt with in this way. With modern communications some of these issues could be sorted out more easily and quickly to ensure farmers are not done out of payments. The same can be said about REPS and the national beef assurance scheme. It is vital farmers have a right of appeal and a right to go to the Ombudsman if necessary. Their right to farm in <Col N="254" /> future is paramount and this should be considered in terms of the amount of paperwork. We have a very serious problem in so far as older farmers in particular do not have the same level of education or access to communications as younger farmers. Recently I was at the retirement function for a senior departmental official who said he was often pleasantly surprised at the extremely good efforts made by farmers and vets under very difficult conditions and that sometimes mistakes were made, but they were not made on purpose. Yet, people in his and other offices could make mistakes but were not held responsible in the same way.</P>
    <P>Common sense must prevail in terms of appeals and the appeals body. Recently I brought to the notice of the Minister the case of a farmer who was looking after his invalid wife and who lost part of his herd through TB. The forms were filled in on a Monday, but because his wife had to be rushed to hospital on a Tuesday they were not delivered until after the infected animals were slaughtered. As yet, those people have not received any money. This is an example of where common sense has been thrown out the window. I was in that farmer's house and saw that woman, who is crippled, with the husband doing his best to look after her, and if the Minister was there he would understand, as should local officials, that an effort was not being made to fiddle the system. The animals were being taken from him under a TB regulation and he was working in full consultation with the Department. For personal reasons he did not get the form in until the following Monday. I was involved in filling in the form. This is an example of the Department going over the top and I certainly will not accept it. Hatchet men who have been brought in to ensure rogue dealers and others such as those recently named are controlled must concentrate on these individuals. In recent days a man contacted me who had sold an animal he did not realise had to be blood tested. That animal went through the system and was overlooked by Department officials in the mart. Yet it is the farmer, who has only 12 animals, who will have to go to court. Departmental officials employed to tackle rogues are taking the soft option of taking innocent farmers to court; I do not think this is the intention of the Minister or that it should be allowed by him.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Daly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to welcome this short but very important Agriculture Appeals Bill designed to implement the commitment given by the Government to the farming community by improving the system for considering appeals. Coming from a rural constituency, I have come across individuals and families who have felt very hard done by, by the Department. On seeing the relatively large amounts these people stand to lose as a result of genuine mistakes on their part or on the part of the Department, I have always contended there should be a strengthening of the rights of these <Col N="255" /> clients to challenge the Department in regard to their entitlement to benefits under any of the direct payments schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has a large amount of interaction with the people it serves. I take this opportunity to thank the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for the numerous press releases and information leaflets he continually forwards to me which ensures that I am kept as well informed by him of the solutions as I am kept aware of the problems by my farming organisations and farm friends. I know customer service plans and programmes and the charter of rights for farmers have been important during the term of this Minister. It was important but not surprising, therefore, that the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to establish on a statutory basis, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, an independent, accessible and properly resourced appeals unit whose remit will include all FEOGA schemes paying directly to individual farmers would be delivered upon. I congratulate the Minister, not just for the Bill, but for his positive response to the representations already made to him. I am sure these will lead to improvements on the Bill which was originally introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to undermine the appeals unit in place for headage and premium schemes since 1995, I strongly believe there is room for improvement in any system, and this Bill will no doubt lead to improvements. The Bill accepts the basic premise that mistakes are made and this is the basis for devising an appeals mechanism. Importantly, it puts the entire operation on a statutory basis, thereby reinforcing the independence of the service. I have heard many people complain about the independence of the service and perhaps the Minister will revisit this aspect in his concluding remarks. It will increase to 28 the number of schemes being dealt with. This will eliminate the limitations on the workings of the existing appeals officers given that they only had the remit for headage and premium schemes. It will also open up the areas covered to include a provision for the input of an appeals office into the Minister's decision-making on whether to refuse or revoke a certificate of approval under the national beef assurance scheme. In response to the issues raised during the debate on the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, a provision will be included for an appeals system for dealers, which is welcome. Given that the aim of the latter is to improve the operation and regulation of dealers to restrict the rogue dealers, this is an opportune time to put in place strong regulations to deal with people whose activities not only work to the detriment of the vast majority of legitimate dealers but who through their irresponsible greed have put the entire industry and the country at risk. It is vital that the new appeals office will be able to examine appeals where the Department is proposing to revoke, suspend or refuse a dealer's <Col N="256" /> registration. In every sense we want fair play for all our citizens &ndash; justice being done and being seen to be done.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to extend the coverage of appeals to include the rural environment protection scheme, the early retirement scheme and other important schemes which deal with on farm investment. I welcome the fact that the Minister has not been prescriptive on the outer limit of the appeals office and has stated that the list of schemes can evolve as the direct payment scheme evolves. It is intended that this appeals system would be built upon and have an identical organisational status to the model of the social welfare appeals system which is in operation since 1990. This complies with the recommendation of the all party Oireachtas sub-committee on SMIs report, 1999, which sought a properly resourced, accessible and independent appeals system similar to those operated by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. While I have some concerns about the work load which tends to lead to the turn around times in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs being in some cases unreasonable, I note the Minister envisages, but does not stipulate, a turn around time of 12 weeks. It is important that this be adhered to as closely as possible. Often a lack of full information being given at the time can slow down a process but should all information be in order at the start there needs to be a deadline concept. I say this to ensure that, should undue delays occur, there will be a reason. If the reason is staffing, it would be good if it was flagged and then the problem addressed rather than have appeals fall into a never-never land. I trust the Minister might keep aspect this in mind.</P>
    <P>It is essential the appeal is heard as if the case was being heard for the first time, as stipulated in the Bill. Too often when people are unhappy with a decision and look for a review they merely receive a restricted response based on the original decision. I welcome the introduction of oral hearings in private and a broad approach being taken to what is for the appellant a most serious issue. I recall years ago a person's disappointment when in a leaving certificate examination he did not receive the results he thought he deserved. When he paid for a recheck he received the same result. He was asked what had he expected, because the marks were just added up again as opposed to the paper being remarked. An appeal must be a proper appeal. It must not be just a paper exercise and one must have a chance to make a case. One must feel he or she will be taken seriously and there must be a presumption of accuracy and reasonableness attached to the decision which will be communicated in a user friendly manner to the appellant. I trust the spirit of the Bill will meet this demand. If it does, there should not be any difficulty in achieving a sense of finality to a given topic.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there is recourse to the High Court and scope for internal review should new <Col N="257" /> information come to light or the director considers the decision was wrong because of error of fact or law. Given that the Ombudsman's ability to investigate appeals officers' decisions is being preserved, this must adequately catch all reasonable angles that may arise.</P>
    <P>A small but important factor is that there is no application fee for the appeal, which is very inclusive. Often a large fee would be attached to appeals, which leads people to think twice before making an appeal. A person with a genuine problem should not be put off by an application fee. Ultimately it would be better if there was no cause for an appeal in the first instance. Many mistakes are made by applicants due to the complexity of forms. One must always keep in mind that our adult literacy problems are acute, thereby giving another reason individuals find forms hard to comprehend. I know from my experience that farmers sometimes have difficulty in filling up extremely complex and long forms. One would almost need a degree to fill up some of these forms. The adult literacy problem was dealt with in the Committee on Education and Science, but perhaps sufficient action has not been taken at interdepartmental level to try to address this issue. Statistics indicate that a large proportion of the farming population is elderly. Following the death of their husbands, some wives find themselves in charge of the farm and relevant sub-applications and they have difficulty with the forms. Often it is the other way round when the male farmer has relied on the wife to fill in all the forms. When she dies, he must fill them in. The surviving spouse is often not familiar with the procedures and this leads to mistakes being made.</P>
    <P>These mistakes are not deliberately made but may have serious consequences in terms of income for two years following the event. I am similarly aware of cases whereby elderly people whose partners have died during the year may be down a couple of sheep when an inspection takes place. These people may not have been in charge of the farm and are probably not capable of running it. If an inspector discovers that a couple of sheep are missing, they may lose their main source of income for perhaps two years, at a time when they are extremely vulnerable as a result of the death of their spouse.</P>
    <P>In my constituency many of the issues relate to mountain sheep who may have fallen into a shuck or bog hole. It is difficult to prove that those sheep existed or to establish where they have gone. It is for these genuine cases that I have sympathy. I emphasise that in no way do I stand over deliberate massaging of figures and forms. Since the Minister has acknowledged that mistakes are being made at official level, we must also recognise that there can be human error on the farm side, for which severe financial penalties have been incurred by farmers. I assume the Minister cannot do very much about the penalties if they are governed by European directives, but I hope that in opening up the appeals system, when <Col N="258" /> genuine errors are found, there can be some way of lessening the penalty.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that all relevant agencies support our farmers in filling out the forms and in the follow-up required to comply with schemes. It is often the case that schemes such as REPS are drawn up beautifully and then the farmer is left to deal with the situation himself until there is a sudden inspection and it is found that something untoward has happened, or some requirement has not been complied with. I do not believe there is enough follow-up between the agencies and the farmers in all cases, given the form-reading ability and knowledge of elderly people as to how the system works.</P>
    <P>I am still concerned about the tagging issue, which I have raised on several occasions. A further case was brought to my notice last night, involving the loss of one tag from one animal in a consignment being sent to a meat factory. The animal was rejected at the factory but, according to the regulations, could not go back to the farm. By the time the matter is sorted, the animal will probably have lost about £100 in value, because it is not the property of the people looking after it, so why should they bother? There seems to be a real problem, whether it is due to the quality of the tags or whatever, and I am not sure how it can be solved. Perhaps it is a matter of allowing some discretion to the local appeals officer to recognise genuine cases and that farm organisations such as the IFA and the ICMSA should be able to establish whether the farmers involved are genuine or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his handling of the foot and mouth disease. I get conflicting representations every day, with some people wanting the Minister to keep up the pressure and not to relax the precautions, while others claim the threat is past and that the restrictions should be eased. It is difficult to strike the right balance. The two suspect cases in the North last Wednesday could have gone either way. I am very disappointed with the level of precautions being taken by the Northern authorities. As a regular traveller through all six counties of Northern Ireland, I have yet to be stopped by an agency there, the Department of Agriculture, the army or the police. If I can travel as freely as that, so too can other people. That contrasts sharply with the great work being done by the Garda Síochána and the personnel of our Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>The Celtic tiger is the only animal under threat from foot and mouth disease in this part of the country. Many people have been very patient with the restrictions which have been applied. I urge the Minister to consult the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to the farm assist scheme. All extensification aid and direct payments should be brought forward for payment as promptly as possible. Interest-free loans would get many people out of difficulty. I hope the Minister will consider these and other relevant issues in looking at any possible easing <Col N="259" /> of the restrictions. I congratulate him on the work of his Department and on this Bill in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for sharing time with me to allow me to contribute to this debate. I join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister of State at that Department on their actions during the recent foot and mouth disease problems. The work of the Department officials is greatly valued by farmers and the community in general in avoiding a situation which could have catastrophic consequences for the livestock industry. The crisis has brought home to people the value of our agricultural sector in terms of the employment of 125,000 people and an income of some £2 billion from farming last year.</P>
      <P>Against that background, this legislation is necessary. Direct payments now represent a substantial part of farmers' incomes. Where difficulties arise in relation to some of these payments, it is only right that an adequate appeals system should be put in place to enable farmers to question the decisions of officials. The Minister's commitment to bring in this legislation was part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It will provide a fair system to have grievances examined independently and to have matters rectified if an injustice has been done.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few points on the proposed appeals procedure. We have had experience of the social welfare appeals system, which has been the subject of complaints about delays. Since there will be a backlog of appeals awaiting attention under this legislation, it is important that adequate staff is provided by the Department to enable speedy decisions to be arrived at.</P>
      <P>I support the points made by other Deputies about the over-complicated forms being presented to farmers. I have seen an application under the farm retirement scheme being returned to a farmer because of some very minor technical errors which could easily have been clarified by a telephone call, instead of causing further delay in resubmitting it through all the various offices and processes. Excessive complication should be eliminated from the schemes concerned and the forms should be simplified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the deductions which are made, especially in the farm retirement scheme, where a pensioner qualifies for the normal old age pension. There is a fairly substantial reduction in this case &ndash; I am not sure whether it relates to a retirement pension or social welfare pension. This needs to be remedied. I urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to discuss the matter with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. People look forward to their retirement and old age pensions. It is totally unjustified to have the pension decimated because a farm retirement pension is also payable. Farmers are being <Col N="260" /> encouraged to enter this scheme to facilitate the transfer of farms.</P>
    <P>The regulations which the Minister is preparing should be completed as soon as possible. There has often been long delays in putting in place the regulations which are part of legislation. The community is looking forward to effective legislation. I welcome the legislation. Farmers hope it will be effective in dealing with some of the problems experienced with the schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in offering my good wishes to the Minister. I congratulate him on the manner in which both he and his officials have handled the recent foot and mouth crisis. They engaged in a lot of hard work in difficult circumstances and the Minister has done well as captain of a good team and deserves credit. We have turned the corner on the foot and mouth crisis and I look forward to the Minister's further advice and guidance on the lifting of restrictions.</P>
      <P>The reason I wish to speak in support of this Bill concerns the matter of the siting of the office. I note the Department in a briefing stated it was the hope of the Minister that the office would be up and running as soon as possible. To facilitate this I urge the Minister to consider siting the office in Portlaoise. There are a number of advantages to this, not least of which is the success of the beef unit in the town. It is on the map as a location where farmers can transact their business and have queries answered. The civil servants there have fine offices, good working conditions and they have forged a very positive relationship with members of the rural community.</P>
      <P>It is important to maintain a certain integrity in the administration of the agriculture industry. Consideration should be given to a pooling of resources which would facilitate senior officers of the Department from headquarters in Dublin who may wish to visit the beef unit and the appeals office in Portlaoise. The town has all the modern infrastructural developments required. There are frequent trains to the town, it is just a little over an hour by road from Dublin and it is a central location that would suit farmers travelling from all parts of the country to have their queries and appeals dealt with. As soon as the legislation is signed, or before that, the Minister and his officials should turn their minds to the physical location of the office. I urge that they consider the town of Portlaoise favourably. I have discussed this matter with the other TDs who represent the constituency. I know Deputies Moloney and Fleming have been in contact with the Department and we agree on this. The selection of Portlaoise would facilitate an early establishment of the unit with good working conditions. In the briefing note that accompanied the legislation specific reference is made to accessibility. I cannot think of a town with more favourable access from any part of the country than Portlaoise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the oral appeals procedure is contained in the Bill and a timeframe should <Col N="261" /> be placed on the appeals. This consideration is important and allows for an appeal of an independent nature. Once a farmer lodges an appeal matters should not drag on. I contrast a neat workable timeframe with the situation that has been allowed develop in An Bord Pleanála where the whole appeals procedure is fraught with difficulty giving rise to appeals gridlock. The situation in the planning appeals board is intolerable. Although there is a statutory timeframe, An Bord Pleanála can issue, as in recent times, global notices to all applicants stating that appeals which should have been heard within three months will now be heard within nine months. That leaves the appellant in a most invidious position.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of regulations for this Bill the Minister should include an acceptable and reasonable timeframe. A farmer would not expect his appeal to be dealt with in a matter of weeks, but a period of two or three months would be reasonable. At present the appeals unit in the Department is less than satisfactory. It is tolerable only because this legislation has been contemplated. The Department probably feels it is better to wait until such time as the independent office is up and running. The present circumstances, where appellants have not been informed that their appeals have been heard weeks ago, much less about the result, is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of any appeal is that there should be sufficient information given to the farmer. Irrespective of whether the appeal is successful, it is important that the appellant know the reasons. Full and detailed information is essential. If an appeal is unsuccessful the appeals office should set out the reasons fully so the appellant is in no doubt as to why it was unsuccessful. If there is to be confidence in the system and real meaning in the concept of transparency, it is essential that full and detailed information is provided.</P>
    <P>The relationship between farmers and bureaucracy has never been greater. It is an unfortunate aspect of farming that so much of the industry is dependent on paperwork, forms, European rules, guidelines, criteria and conditions of eligibility that was not envisaged by generations of agricultural producers. Advice and information is crucial in maintaining a positive interest by farmers in the agricultural industry. Nothing induces more anxiety than the constant returning and non-acceptance of application forms and raising queries and seeking further information about grant entitlements. There should be a way to codify or co-ordinate the system, or to assist the farmer by providing information. There could be a roadshow, a mobile farmers' advice bureau, that farmers could visit occasionally in their locality to discuss matters of importance.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Daly, I was presented recently with a blank application form on the current round of the farm retirement scheme. It is a complicated document. Assisting the public with these forms and providing information was the bread and butter of Deputies. Public representa<Col N="262" /> tives do this now at their peril, such is the detailed information required. If there is a difficulty, it could cause a problem in the Deputy's clinic with the notice stating that no liability is attached to any information supplied or forms filled. Perhaps all public representatives should display such a notice because of the nature of form filling and the way in which agricultural forms in particular are left untouched for months before it is revealed that the application is valid only from the date on which the accurate information is supplied. I know of cases where the accurate information could be supplied only after some months because of the omission of a minor piece of information by the person filling out the form. There should be greater flexibility and more common sense in these procedures. Farmers and others completing the forms do not have degrees in public administration, management or accountancy. Mistakes and omissions will be made, not by wilful neglect or fraud, but through persons being unfamiliar with filling in the type of forms required today. A roadshow, or information bureau, could be set up at marts, for example, offering expert help.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would deal with certain amendments to the emergency legislation on the Committee Stage of this Bill. The vexed sensitive issue of tagging may give rise to undue hardship. The eradication of fraud should be, and is, the priority of the Minister and the Department. Double tagging is unacceptable and must be dealt with by the full rigours of the law. I know of a farmer who, through no fault of his own, possessed animals that had tags corresponding to tags on animals in another part of the country with a similar tagging regime. Under current regulations, the farmer had no choice and an order for confiscation and slaughter was issued. He has received no compensation. Farmers may, in good faith, purchase animals which have problems with their tags and they are not entitled to compensation. Also, there is no alternative to slaughtering animals. Having been tested and found healthy, they are slaughtered immediately under the law. There must be a better way. If the animals were kept from the food chain commercially, this valuable commodity might be slaughtered for another use. No one benefits from this harsh system. The application of these regulations is unduly harsh. I do not suggest that the law should not applied, but there are the options of criminal sanction, fines or imprisonment, rather than slaughtering the animals.</P>
    <P>During the course of another debate on agriculture I raised with the Minister a problem relating to section 12 of the Land Act, 1965. Many of the sections of the Land Act, 1965 are of little or no consequence in the Ireland of the European Union. Agricultural practices and land use has changed since its enactment. Section 12 has no practical effect and the effect of section 45 has changed since 1965. I hope the Minister's Department will urgently update these provisions <Col N="263" /> because the current structure causes unnecessary concerns for many agricultural practitioners. It imposes a unnecessary burden of extra paperwork and file keeping. I wish the Minister well in setting up the appeals office and impress on him the advantages of siting it in a central location, easily accessible to farmers, senior departmental officials and himself as he travels to and from Dublin. Perhaps he might consider Portlaoise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Aylward.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill which, hopefully, comes at the end of a time that has been very difficult for the Minister and his Department, the foot and mouth crisis, through which they have come with flying colours. As other speakers did, I commend the Minister, his officials and the other members of the community who contributed to the success in that area.</P>
      <P>We all acknowledge that there is an urgent need to improve the system for considering appeals under the direct payments schemes. In doing so, we also need to acknowledge the great progress that has been made in ensuring speed and efficiency of payment under a myriad of schemes. Three or four years ago, most speakers would have complained bitterly about the delay in payment under various schemes. Thankfully, we have moved on from that. On that basis, this appeals system has enormous potential and will improve the lot of the farmer very significantly.</P>
      <P>Since 1995 there has been an appeals unit in the Department for headage and premium schemes. This Bill puts it on a statutory basis and, more important, widens the range of schemes which can be dealt with under appeal. The Minister commended the competence and impartiality of the existing appeals unit. That is fair to say, although it hardly enjoyed widespread support among farmers which this new appeals system will. It needs to be seen as quite independent of the Department. The Minister has ensured that will be the case.</P>
      <P>The provision for an oral appeal will be hugely important. When people have an opportunity to put their case in person, or have it put professionally for them, they tend to feel that the point which the initial officer might have missed, and without consideration of which he based his decision, will be considered in the new set up. I also welcome the fact the Minister is committed to having matters dealt with speedily under section 84. A target of 12 weeks would be excellent, although it might be quite difficult to attain. That the appeals system is based on the social welfare appeals system means that it will be familiar to all of us. That system has been in operation since 1990 and has gained a huge level of acceptance. That it is based on that appeals system will ensure it has a degree of independence which should aid its effectiveness and its acceptability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> Many speakers said the REP scheme needs to be the subject of scrutiny and they welcomed its inclusion in this Bill. For many farmers, it is one of the most important schemes. For the environment and ecology of the country, it is, undoubtedly, the most important scheme. Unfortunately, it is sometimes beset by difficulties. A vexed question frequently concerns the relationship between the farmer, the REPS planner and the Department. I do not know how this can be addressed by the appeals board because I am sure the contract in law is between the farmer and the REPS planner. If the difficulty which is thrown up happens to be in that area, I do not know how the appeals board will be in a position to deal with it. Quite frequently we, as politicians, find that the farmer is very severely penalised for what is, in effect, an error on the part of the planner. For example, only in recent days I came across a case where a farmer's plan was submitted late. In his view it was an error on the part of the planner but he will end up paying back a five figure sum to the Department. He would have to go through the courts and pursue the planner to deal with that matter. In setting out the regulations, the Minister will need to ensure, if at all possible, that sometimes fraught relationship is addressed.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to these difficulties. Deputy Penrose referred to a case where a huge penalty was imposed on a farmer because he removed a few blackthorn bushes. He had to remove them to repair a fence which he was required to do under the REPS plan. This is a frequent occurrence in the Burren where Dúchas often creates difficulties and prevents farmers from carrying out works which they are required to do under their REPS plan. Recently, a farmer was taken to court for undertaking the very work required under his REPS plan by a different arm of the State, by Dúchas. In addition, he had to cope with a very severe penalty.</P>
    <P>There are also problems with the farm retirement scheme to which a number of Deputies referred. I know of a number of cases where farmers have had to pay back huge amounts. In one case, a farmer had to pay back in excess of £50,000 because earnings from his part-time work exceeded those of his farm. Because the scheme is EU-financed, there is a particular difficulty in that area. There is also the difficulty referred to by Deputy Daly when the farmer's spouse qualifies for the old age pension. They find, usually unexpectedly, that the farm retirement scheme payment is reduced by that amount. I suppose one could say that if they read the conditions of the scheme when they entered it, they would know that would happen. I am aware of at least two cases where there is an added complication in that one of those concerned is a carer and because of their involvement in the farm retirement scheme, they are perhaps losing out quite badly. I do not know if it will be the job of the appeals board or within its competence, but it is an area, as Deputy Flanagan said, where a modicum of common sense would go a long way <Col N="265" /> towards addressing some of the problems and, hopefully, that will be the case.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the fact that there will be no ministerial or departmental authority to intervene in the decision-making process and that the decisions will be binding on the Department, otherwise the appeals board would have no teeth. The chief appeals officer, or the effective chief executive officer of the body, will have a hugely important task, particularly in the first couple of years, in setting out his stall and in establishing a body which is able to address the appeals referred to it. The Minister intends to set out the appeals procedure by regulation and that allows a degree of flexibility. As he indicated, the regulations are virtually completed. I urge him to bring those regulations before the Oireachtas joint committee for debate.</P>
    <P>Some people will think that the fact a legal appeal can only be made to the High Court might be setting the bar a bit high and there might be a case to allow a farmer address a concern to a lower court. I am sure the Minister will address that when he concludes the debate. I thought removing the entire appeals process from the ambit of the Ombudsman might have been the best idea but the fact the case load from the Department to the Ombudsman will be hugely reduced should enable that office to operate more efficiently in other areas. That the appeals office is answerable to the Ombudsman has an advantage in a sense, or the Ombudsman will have an advantage in that a huge amount of documentation will be available which, to be fair to his office, frequently would not have been available to him in making determinations on agricultural matters heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his intention to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for an appeals system for dealers under the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001. That is perhaps the most important legislation he has brought before the Dáil in his term in office and it is only fair to provide for that appeals system here as he undertook to do during that debate.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects which interests me about the appeals mechanism is how far back cases which can be referred to the appeals board can go. I have been here for eight or nine years and I can think of matters which arose during my first year which were a year or two old at that stage which could usefully get an airing before an objective appeals board. I trust such issues can be referred. If it is the case that relatively old issues can be referred, it will hugely increase the case load in the short-term but it might be possible to allow them to be referred and perhaps allow a different time scale for dealing with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister also provided for an appeal in the case of the national beef assurance scheme which is useful and sensible. He also included a stipulation that the reasons for a decision must be given to the appellant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> More than anything else, that would ensure people were fully aware of what was involved and would be able to consider it in that context, even if they were not exactly overjoyed by the decision.</P>
    <P>Another issue I want to address is the question of fairness and proportionality in terms of penalties. I took it from what the Minister said that the Commission has or is about to set up a working group to address the issue. Unless progress is made in that area, the entire appeals process could be seriously hamstrung by EU regulations and ultimately rendered virtually useless. That would be very damaging. However, I trust that the working group which has been set up at EU level to examine the Common Agricultural Policy and other issues will ensure that the appeals mechanism will be afforded some degree of flexibility in making decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Killeen for sharing his time. I join in congratulating the Minister, the Minister of State, the officials and all the people involved in the recent fight against the potential spread of food and mouth disease. Our thanks and gratitude is due not just to the farming community but to people generally for showing a spirit many might have thought did not exist. The contribution made by all the people in the country should be recognised.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. I have lobbied the Minister over many years at parliamentary party and other meetings on the penalties imposed in relation to claims for subsidies and premia. A commitment was given in the programme for Government to provide for a statutorily-based system of appeal, and this legislation is now before the House. I recognise the role played by the existing appeals unit in the Department since 1995, although it was limited in that it dealt only with headage and premia. Despite best intentions, the simplest mistakes often led to the severest of penalties being meted out. Listening to my colleagues on either side of the House speak on this legislation, what strikes me is how much we have in common. Farming activities may differ greatly from county to county, but the problems are the same; draconian penalties have been imposed on people because they made the simplest of mistakes when filling out complicated forms.</P>
      <P>The Bill reinforces independence and fairness by setting up an appeals office with proper structures which covers all 28 schemes. Deputy Flanagan suggested a location for this new office. I could suggest several suitable locations. I have spoken to the Minister in the past about decentralisation to Kilkenny, and will have a word with him again later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some schemes that were not previously covered will be covered under the new system, in particular the REP, farm retirement and area aid schemes. We can all give examples of just how severe the penalties were. In the context of the early retirement scheme, there have been prob<Col N="267" /> lems with land registry and with Land Commission decisions. Where problems arose as a result of farmers taking in good faith advice given in good faith to them by Teagasc officials acting on behalf of the Department, the officials were not prepared to come forward and support the farmers in making their cases to the Department. Although that happened in a minority of cases, it is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I remember the chaos in the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs when we first arrived in this House. Dealing with that Department was frustrating. I have often mentioned that it is the Department that has most improved over the years, due to improved efficiency and the provision of an appeals system which was open and transparent and which allowed oral appeals. That did more for the Department's reputation than anything else.</P>
    <P>Perception is all-important. The system must be seen by farmers to be fair and just. The severity of penalties imposed on the most vulnerable was very difficult to take, particularly in light of the evidence in recent months that rogues and cowboys roamed the country for many years and got away with murder while poor old farmers were disqualified and lost their benefits for years because they made an innocent mistake when filling out a form. Given those comparisons, this Bill is all the more welcome, particularly as all the schemes are now included. I particularly welcome the aspiration towards a time limit of 12 weeks to turn over cases, although there will be complicated cases that will take far longer than that.</P>
    <P>Will it be possible to bring cases before the appeals board retrospectively? Most Deputies who deal with agricultural matters hope provision will be made for genuine cases to get a proper hearing, perhaps an oral hearing, before this appeals group, and that they will be able to bring competent people with them to put their case.</P>
    <P>I agree that we must sell this system to farmers, through the marts, agricultural offices and advisory services. It is important that this be done as simply and as efficiently as possible. I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his efforts at EU level to bring to the attention of the Commission the severity of penalties imposed, especially in the case of innocent errors. They have caused great pain and distress to individuals and dissatisfaction generally in farming circles at a time when the star of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is riding high. It is appropriate that the good work of recent months be seen to continue. Factors that cause great distress and dissatisfaction should be addressed. I am glad that as a result of the Minister's efforts all the schemes under the CAP will be simplified and that, regarding the severity of penalties, the Commission has agreed to set up a working group of all the states, including Ireland which, I hope, will have a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I emphasise that while this legislation may seem insignificant, it is important to many people. It is important that the appeals office is up and running as soon as possible. This legislation was promised and everything takes time but I am glad this will be in place in the near future so that we have a system that is seen to be honest, open, fair and transparent. People should feel they have the right to go somewhere to present their case and air their grievances, and such a system will be in place to ensure those cases are heard fairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the legislation. When the Minister was debating this in the Seanad last February he indicated his pleasure at debating it there and also referred to his previous experience in the Seanad, hoping he would not have to go back.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill but I am concerned by certain aspects of it. Many speakers have applauded the setting up of the appeals office but I would like its officials to be drawn from the wider Civil Service rather than specifically from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The reason is that it could almost be a self-policing system resembling the old appeals office, where Members would have had to help people who had problems with REPS, which seemed to cause particular difficulties. There is a rigidity in many of these schemes because of EU rules and regulations but often that rigidity causes emotional trauma to farmers as a result of excessive penalties arising out of very small offences.</P>
      <P>To illustrate how the appeals system works, I recently had a case involving a person I know well who lives close to me. He removed some hedgerow for safety reasons at the request of a neighbour. It was important he did so but he did not notify the REPS section that he was doing so in time. He was penalised and the local officer decided he had lost out on his REPS payment. When I asked the supervisor to visit the site, he agreed and could understand fully why the hedgerow was taken away for safety reasons. The person has gone through the appeals process in Wexford and, interestingly enough, the supervisor recommended that in this case the payment should be allowed. However, the supervisor was overturned by the appeals section.</P>
      <P>The man involved is emotionally upset by the whole process, which I understand. Although we are setting up an appeals system that will have a wider embrace, will those involved be more objective than was the case in the past, where the appeals section included Department officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is unhappy with certain officials and has the ultimate power to demote, will that produce excessive zeal on the part of the appeals officer or will promotion chances be enhanced? It is like the situation in the Department of Foreign Affairs, where the internal audit system is fine but often if that audit system is operated by the same officials there is a natural tendency to protect one's own people, who may even be superior to one within the organisation. I would prefer if <Col N="269" /> at least the director of the appeals office was drawn from outside the Department, as he or she could then look at matters in an objective way.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has done a lot for people who have had problems with different schemes but he is the person of last resort. He can assess all the data relevant to a specific case and will research it thoroughly to its ultimate conclusion. I am pleased that if someone is unhappy with the appeals office he can still have recourse to the Ombudsman as his last resort. Without the Ombudsman we would have a lot of difficulties &ndash; look at the nursing home subvention cases recently highlighted by the Ombudsman. We introduced nursing home legislation but it was never intended that family assessment and pension entitlements would be reduced by one fifth, regardless of whether the Department of Health and Children arbitrarily took decisions. We as legislators introduced the legislation in 1990 but when the Department of Health got its hands on it, it introduced regulations. If it were not for the Ombudsman highlighting those recent cases and going back over the past, there would be no redress within the health boards in terms of nursing home subvention levels.</P>
    <P>The Minister should convey to the Minister for Health and Children that it is high time he advised the health boards about the family income assessment aspect of this matter. The boards are waiting for that instruction so they can pay people who have been penalised in the past. I have tremendous appreciation for the work of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify whether this appeals officer will focus entirely on the premium issue or will he have a wider role regarding farm retirement? Deputy Flanagan, who is a legal man, has pointed out the difficulties in filling in forms. We all know about the farm retirement scheme and how farmers have to lease their holding. Quite often they get the maximum payment, yet changes are introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development such as the recent change regarding dormant milk quotas &ndash; many farmers sold off their milk quotas and would have retained their land. I recently dealt with a case where someone leasing for five years went back to lease for a further five years. However, it is difficult now to get a person to lease land without a quota. There is a lot of land available and a farmer would get £10,000 for leasing his land with a quota, that is on top of his farm retirement pension. Then he is suddenly thrust back into a situation where he is depending on the farm retirement pension and he has a few months to find another lessee. If he is unsuccessful he is told by the Department he can turn his land into an ecological reserve, as the terminology goes. That means leaving one's land fallow and doing nothing with it for five years. A farmer is encouraged to, and has to, part with his quota because of regulations which are introduced and which ultimately impact on him, penalising him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> There was never a better climate for introducing changes. As the Minister knows, with the foot and mouth disease crisis the Department got the chance to introduce changes, which it possibly did not feel it had the heart to do in the past or which were opposed by farming organisations which did not want those changes &ndash; for example, tagging sheep. We had the unfortunate situation where sheep brought into the country from other countries had tags removed, and we are aware of the sequence of events that followed. When that is introduced we will have a level playing pitch, but the agricultural appeals board may be busy again because of the changes and problems that may result.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that if the appeals process fails the farmer has redress to the High Court, which can be very expensive. Is it right to send him in that direction? That should be examined. Deputy Flanagan remarked that a lower court should possibly be considered in that context if a farmer has a case to prove.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned the location of the office, different aspects of which I want to discuss, as well as matters relating to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Everyone focuses on decentralisation from Dublin to rural locations, which is understandable. In Newcastle West, we put forward our case for that. Has the Minister ever looked at decentralisation out of cities? There is an office of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in the centre of Limerick, where farmers cannot park when they go to do their business. There is an office in Newcastle West which provides a token service from one official on half a day each week.</P>
    <P>Many of those working in departmental offices come from rural locations. Has the Minister considered decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development's office in Limerick to the heart of the Golden Vale? It may be worth looking into as there may be enthusiasm within the staff. I flagged this issue in a local newspaper, as a result of which I received numerous telephone calls from members of staff anxious that such a move should happen rather than travelling back and forth into the city each day.</P>
    <P>Another element of this Bill that has been referred to is the REP scheme. Perhaps the Minister can clarify what happens to a farmer who pays a fee to a REPS planner, whether from Teagasc or a private consultant, if defects are subsequently found in his application and he is penalised. Does this Bill make it compulsory for REPS planning people, including Teagasc, to have appropriate insurance to cover such an eventuality? Those whose REPS plans are independently drawn up from outside and subsequently are penalised often find themselves in an unfortunate situation. If an insurance mechanism is not provided for in this Bill, it should be considered.</P>
    <P>Farmers have a certain amount of dealing with the premium unit of the Department of Agri<Col N="271" /> culture, Food and Rural Development in Portlaoise. The staff there are customer-friendly and helpful, as are staff of the Department generally. Overall, the Department plays a dominant role in Irish society and has a network of offices around the country. It sometimes seems there are deviations within this sector with which the Minister may not be happy and which have been highlighted in recent times as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis. We have heard about the unorthodox practices of the past and about the temptations that existed. The agricultural climate is open for important changes. The consumer is an important part of the agricultural network. We are conscious of consumers when we speak of animals and premiums.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister hopes to model the agricultural appeals system on that of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which has worked efficiently since 1990. It is considered to be an autonomous and independent unit of the Department, as it should be. Autonomy leads to a degree of success when cases go to appeal, so the consumer appreciates the work that has been done. As I said earlier, those who work in the appeals unit of the Department were drawn from the wider civil service. The Minister should not form the agriculture appeals unit exclusively from within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as he may find a level of objectivity outside it. I realise the Minister is concerned to recruit those who have an appreciation of the agricultural sector, but I believe there would be far more independence and autonomy if he recruited from within the wider civil service and I hope he does so.</P>
    <P>The appeal aspect is very important for farmers. There is a level of bureaucracy which may be compatible to those who have green certificates and to younger farmers who are computer literate, but there is a cohort of older farmers, many of whom dropped out of educational establishments at a young age, who find paperwork intimidating. I appeal to the Minister to be sensitive to the needs of older farmers when formulating an appeals mechanism, as their mistakes are often quite genuine. I hope the mechanism which exists within social welfare, whereby people can call on a friendly public or legal representative to assist them or present their case at oral hearings, can be similarly applied to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The environment in which appeals are carried out can make people nervous. I presume that agricultural appeals will be carried out throughout the country, as is the case with social welfare. Whether appeal hearings are held in hotels or in offices, I ask the Minister to be conscious at all times of the importance to the consumer of privacy. This can be forgotten at times, even within the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, by those who work in offices and are not intimidated by queues. As I pointed out to the secretary of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs last week, young <Col N="272" /> people in offices for the first time often find themselves intimidated when they are questioned about their name or address by officials while queuing and those behind often ask them to hurry up. Everybody is entitled to privacy in which to present their case.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill, but I have made certain points regarding where I think it could be modified and further improved. An appeals mechanism exists already, but it is restricted as people police themselves. It would be far more objective if somebody from outside came in to assist. Like other speakers, I think a period of retrospection should be considered for REPS cases and other cases following the introduction of this legislation. Those who are unhappy with the appeals mechanism as it has existed up to now should be given the chance to present their case. The Minister's hands are often tied by European Union rules and guidelines, some of which have a rigidity which is not compatible with Ireland. The penalties that exist are unjust and unfair.</P>
    <P>Modern farming is full of concern as people worry for the future. If we introduce a more stringent regime, we are bound to have difficulties. I hope this Bill helps to address such difficulties and that farmers will feel they have another layer of service to which they can appeal, so that their rights are vindicated. If necessary, the Minister should specify that a farmer may be accompanied at an appeal by a legal representative or other person to present his case. This legislation is perhaps silent in that regard and perhaps my proposals are impermissible. I ask the Minister to comment on that in his final remarks.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and, like other speakers, I compliment him on his fine work on foot and mouth disease to date. I understand he was praised in Dublin Castle last night by no less a man than Cardinal Connell, so it can be said that he has received a blessing directly from the Vatican.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill to a certain extent. I compliment the Minister and Ministers of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the officials of the Department for their work during the foot and mouth disease crisis of the past three months. A tremendous amount of work was carried out in the Department and by officials throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had firsthand experience of the work by officials from the Department, Revenue and Teagasc, and by gardaí at Rosslare Port. Tribute must be paid to all those who have done a magnificent job in this area. Tribute must also be paid to the rural and urban communities for the way they came together in a true spirit of patriotism to help <Col N="273" /> protect our important agricultural industry. They recognised its importance and the large numbers in urban and rural areas involved in the agriculture and food sector.</P>
    <P>There was much talk about grant payments today and when the Bill was debated in the Seanad. Grants payments have been made more speedily in recent years resulting in far fewer complaints. Department officials, the Minister and previous Ministers must be complimented on improving the rate at which payments are made to farmers. There was much criticism of delays in grant payments in previous years. Members sought, by way of parliamentary questions and other means, to encourage the Minister to put in place a more farmer-friendly system. That is in place in all the Department offices. Deputy Finucane mentioned the office in Portlaoise. I mention Johnstown Castle, which has one of the most farmer-friendly staff in the country. I always find them very helpful.</P>
    <P>I discussed the new appeals system with the Minister on different occasions and am probably one of the few Deputies who has serious reservations about it. It will result in our giving away more of our powers, as once the appeals system is in place, neither I nor any other Deputy will be able to table a question to the Minister on why a grant payment due to a farmer in Wexford, Kilkenny or elsewhere has been delayed or reduced or to seek answers in respect of grants payments on behalf of farmers. We will have to depend on the appeals system to deal with that. That is regrettable in some ways as we seem to be giving away more and more of our powers. In these politically correct times, it seems to be popular to set up an independent appeals board &ndash; it seems it is only the politicians who cannot make a decision in so far as some people are concerned. It appears the appeals system will be with us. The introduction of it has been agreed by the partners in Government and that seems to be supported by all political parties. I hope the appeals system will be open, transparent and helpful to farmers. We are living in changing times, particularly in the agricultural sector. The foot and mouth crisis has brought some of the farm organisations on board in the making of decisions that probably would not have been heard of a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>Premium payments account for a major proportion of farm income. Many farmers have made genuine mistakes when completing forms in the past and were subjected to severe penalties and loss of income. I am glad the Minister, through his negotiating skills in the EU, has managed to be appointed to a working group that will examine this area. Small errors can result in major penalties and severe hardship for family farmers. Such errors are usually made by small farmers who cannot afford the loss of income that results from such errors.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister has been examining the possibility of simplifying application forms. One would need to be a lawyer or an accountant <Col N="274" /> to complete some of the forms issued in recent times. We heard much talk of Teagasc encouraging farmers to become computer literate, but many older farmers will continue to complete their forms as they have done down through the years. If one puts an &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the wrong section of the form, one's payment could be lost, and that possibility should be taken into account. I ask the Minister to seriously examine the introduction of more simplified forms. In the context of the review within the EU, I hope less severe penalties resulting from errors in the completion of forms will be imposed in future.</P>
    <P>Under the new legislation, the agricultural appeals office will be established on a statutory basis to deal with farmers who wish to challenge decisions of the Department regarding their entitlements to grants under any of the Feoga schemes. Direct payments to farmers, including REPS, early retirement, installation aid, livestock, headage and premia schemes, and arable aid schemes, will come under the appeals office. The Minister said the appeals office will be based on the social welfare appeals system. That system is working reasonably well, but there is a delay in hearing appeals. It has taken four or five months for some cases to be taken, which is far to slow. That delay may be due to a staffing or some other problem. I ask the Minister to ensure that the appeals office, when established, will have adequate staff.  </P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a 12 week turnaround for the payment of grants, which I welcome. If there are long delays in such payments, farmers become frustrated and annoyed waiting for them to come through and hope that, if a payment is rejected, the appeals office will reverse the decisions made in the Department.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider allowing a farmer attending the hearing of an appeal to bring a person with him, whether his wife, public representative or someone else who would be able to argue the case on his behalf. I attend many social welfare appeals on behalf of constituents and I am aware many other Deputies do likewise. The appellant is generally nervous and sometimes feels he may be ambushed and not get a fair hearing. In the case of social welfare appeals, an appeals officer from Dublin or elsewhere and one or two local social welfare officers may be present, which amounts to three against one in some cases. I do not know how many officers will attend such agricultural appeals. I ask the Minister to consider allowing the person attending the appeal to bring along another person to support him. I do not mean a solicitor or barrister but some other person who would be of advantage to him.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for oral hearings, which is welcome. Such hearings will be held in private and the person concerned will be advised of the decision, which is important. Under the existing system farmers are often not given an explanation as to why their appeal has not been allowed. I ask the Minister to ensure they will be given a full <Col N="275" /> and satisfactory explanation of the reason for not allowing an appeal.</P>
    <P>The siting of the appeals office was mentioned. While the main appeals office will probably be located in Dublin, does the Minister intend to establish regional offices? Having regard to the many Department and Teagasc offices around the country, he should consider establishing regional offices, as that would make it easier for people to attend them.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with hardy annuals in terms of constituents who bring their cases to our attention. Some constituents call to me to complain that their appeals were not heard by the Department. I ask the Minister if a system of retrospection will be allowed whereby farmers will be allowed to raise old sores, so to speak, complaints they had with the Department, with the new appeals office. They should be allowed to do so and I ask Minister to consider providing for that.</P>
    <P>Will the chief appeals officer, when appointed, be called before one of the committees of the Houses to give a rundown on how the office is working and to enable Members question him or her on it? If not, there will be a serious problem in that the public representatives will not be allowed to raise questions in the Dáil about farmers. They should be allowed to question the chief appeals officer on an annual basis on how the system is operating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which provides for a statutory appeals mechanism. I found the appeals system that has been in place since 1995 to be good but, obviously, farmers and people in the agricultural sector want to see it placed on a statutory basis, as will happen now. I welcome the fact that the Minister is extending the mechanism to include not only the direct payment schemes but other areas also.</P>
      <P>The Minister would need to possess the wisdom of Solomon to decide between the different viewpoints of people urging him to be vigilant about the foot and mouth crisis on the one hand and others asking for certain restrictions to be lifted on the other. In that context I thought of what Rudyard Kipling said about keeping your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. Perhaps the Minister is finding that the two points of view being put to him are too strong, but I pay tribute to him for his work to date. I also pay tribute to the staff in his Department, his Ministers of State and the people of Ireland who rallied to deal with the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I look forward to the day when the Minister and his committee can reopen the marts. As the Minister will be aware, that is important in the west, where store producers are keen to see the marts reopen. I hope they will reopen by the end of the year. I am sure <Col N="276" /> the Minister and his Department are dealing with that important issue.</P>
    <P>I was happy to hear reference made to the farm retirement scheme and the REP scheme. Like other Deputies, I find it hard to understand how occasionally farmers who have joined the REP scheme, which fosters organic farming and is suitable for smallholders, can get a payment in the first year, be penalised for two years and have the payments resume again. Obviously, it is an area which must be investigated and I hope this new appeals body will deal with that.</P>
    <P>The other issue more frequently brought to my attention is the farm retirement scheme. I have often raised with the Minister the issue of people receiving inquiries regarding overpayments. It appears that, according to European regulations, a farmer can only avail of the farm retirement scheme as a supplement to the old age pension. Many farmers do not notify the Department that they are receiving the old age pension when they apply for benefit under the farm retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will emphasise the change he has introduced in the scheme. One major change is that a farmer can now avail of the farm retirement scheme from the age of 55. A farmer who joins the scheme at that age and is not entitled to any other pension, other than the old age pension, can draw the full pension for ten years without any reduction. Obviously, farmers run into difficulties when they are notified about reductions due to overpayments and, as the old age pension increases due to significant rises in social welfare benefits, they must either repay money or are informed they no longer qualify under the farm retirement scheme because the old age pension has increased by that amount. That issue must be stressed to a greater degree in dialogue with farmers inquiring about the farm retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals process has been cited as the precedent for the new appeals system. There is a need to appoint extra staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to operate the apppeals system as a large number of appeals can be expected. Already there are delays in the social welfare appeals system. I would like if queries could be dealt with at local level. In the Department of Education and Science, for example, there will be welfare officers and psychological services at local level. Obviously, local government and the health boards are good examples of decisions being taken at local level. Decisions should be taken at a local level in so far as possible.</P>
    <P>Many farmers have questioned me about the farm development services. A great deal of investment has been made in new marts and the Teagasc offices in many areas are being refurbished. Galway, the second largest county, could do with a great deal of investment in farm development, as I am sure Deputy Ulick Burke will agree, so that farmers can deal with the <Col N="277" /> officials in private. I hope facilities can be provided.</P>
    <P>On the question of the delays, the Minister mentioned a turnaround of 12 weeks although he could not give a precise deadline. That has to do with staffing, as I said. If early decisions could be dealt with at local level, it would significantly help people with these problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech the appeals system for dealers. Like many of my colleagues, I have met with many dealers. They probably were resisting all of the Department regulations about registration and having their premises approved, but they must understand that they cannot trade in animals or poultry if they are not registered. We all know that there have been rogue dealers, and this has been one of the real worries in the battle against foot and mouth disease, but the farming community know that dealers have been instrumental in helping to maintain the price of stock throughout the country. When the Minister is introducing the regulations, he should take that into consideration. In the majority of cases, dealers act in a bona fides manner. In addition to making a living, they are also helping maintain the price farmers get for their animals.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes mention of the appeals officer. The Minister stated that there will be a chief appeals officer, a director of agricultural appeals and that there is also the question of other officers. Irrespective of where the appeals will be held, it is important that the process is quick and that there be provision for an oral hearing because that has been one of the great benefits of the social welfare appeals system. I would not suggest appealing cases to the High Court because that would prove an expensive route. Therefore I hope that between having the appeals system and an oral hearing, such as that available under the social welfare system, we will be able to deal with such problems without the need to go to court.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the representations he received in regard to the national beef assurance scheme. This is an important scheme. Nowadays everybody is talking about assurance, reliability and traceability. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and hope it will be given a speedy passage through the House.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the escalating industrial unrest, particularly in the public sector, as evidenced by difficulties and disputes</P>

      <P>&ndash;among secondary teachers </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" />&ndash;in the CIE group of companies</P>
    <P>&ndash;in the Electricity Supply Board</P>
    <P>&ndash;among nurses and junior doctors</P>
    <P>&ndash;in the clerical grades of the Civil Service,</P>
    <P>&ndash;concerned that these difficulties may undermine the stability of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness resulting in industrial chaos throughout the economy; </P>
    <P>&ndash;deplores the Government's policies which have led directly to inflationary pay demands and the Government's abject failure to address the growing industrial unrest and its underlying causes.</P>
    <P>What we are witnessing in the public sector area is not a series of industrial relations brush fires. What we are witnessing is the break-up of partnership and the dismantling of the national consensus so assiduously built up and cultivated by successive Governments since the late 1980s. What we are witnessing is the return to the bad old days of the 1970s and 1980s when Ireland had one of the worst industrial relations records in the developed world in terms of the number of strikes, the number of days lost and the knock-on consequences for the economy. We are witnessing the destruction of one of the cornerstones of our current economic success &ndash; the partnership approach model. It was this spirit of partnership which was the axis around which the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Prosperity, the Programme for Competitiveness and Work and Partnership 2000 were built.</P>
    <P>The spirit of partnership which permeated and underpinned all the successful partnership agreements is now gone, with the result that the current model, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is doomed. What this Government has failed to realise is that it has been singularly responsible for allowing the spirit and trust, which is the key ingredient for such partnerships, to dissipate and disappear. Once that spirit of trust goes, it is difficult, if not impossible, to retrieve or restore it.</P>
    <P>The primary reason the PPF is doomed is that the disintegration is happening in the public sector where the Government has direct management responsibility. It is not happening in the private sector as was very much the case back in the 1970s and 1980s. It is the Government and its mismanagement of some of the key sectors for which it has responsibility that is directly responsible for the consequences which will flow from such dismemberment.</P>
    <P>Never before was national leadership more badly needed to salvage the situation and never before was leadership so markedly absent or non-existent right from the very top &ndash; from a Taoiseach who refuses to take tough decisions and who seems to sniff the air every morning to see what way the wind is blowing or in what direction the crowd have gone before deciding what to say <Col N="279" />&ndash; right through to the various Ministers in whose different sectoral areas industrial chaos has broken out.</P>
    <P>Last week's lack of performance by the Government in dealing with the rail drivers' dispute was pathetic. Once again, 100,000 commuters in the east were left stranded by Iarnród Éireann. The response of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and here in the Dáil, was to throw her hands in the air and plaintively plead: &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;  The Minister is the sole shareholder and yet she refuses to even entertain the suggested possibility that she has any responsibility to do anything to bring about a resolution.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, train services to the south were paralysed, and on Thursday the west was hit. Again the Minister is pressed to get involved in terms of appointing a mediator. It is the same Pontius Pilate response when she asserts that she will not get involved. Not surprisingly, the same ostrich-like posture was adopted by the Taoiseach at Question Time on Wednesday when he stood full square behind the policy of non-action by his Minister. Is it any wonder that on Wednesday the <i>Evening Herald </i>newspaper carried a well-deserved ministerial lambasting under the heading: &ldquo;The terrible track record of Mary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible track record. In July 1998, a one-day rail stoppage paralysed the entire national rail system. In November 1998, newspaper headings claimed that rail workers were ready for war on cost cuts. There was an unofficial strike by NBRU because a £44 million cost-cutting plan was being implemented. In December 1999, thousands of commuters about to descend on Dublin to do their Christmas shopping were left stranded ten days before Christmas. The newspapers had headlines such as: &ldquo;Rail strike misery in row over rostering&rdquo;. There were calls for the Minister to intervene to get the rail services back on the rails. Instead of intervening the Minister told the nation that she was disappointed at the stoppage and sorry for the public. Ministerial disappointment and sadness are of little consolation to the travelling public who expect positive action, leadership and a resolution to problems, not sympathy.</P>
    <P>The strikes of 1998 and 1999 were followed by one of the most damaging and devastating strikes in the history of industrial relations, when for the entire summer of 2000, the ILDA train drivers withdrew their services completely. For ten full weeks there were no train services to the provinces. What should have been a boom season for the tourist industry becomes an absolute disaster. Huge losses are incurred by hotels, outdoor pursuits' interests, guesthouses, the bed and breakfast business, restaurants and pubs.</P>
    <P>In spite of pleas from all sectors for Minister O'Rourke to take a leadership role, she refused to do so. Nobody at any stage expected her to get directly involved in talks. What was expected, demanded and needed was an initiative from the <Col N="280" /> Minister to get the industrial relations machinery involved at the earliest possible stage. In other words, to get the various parties sitting down together and to get talks going. The Minister steadfastly refused to do anything, taking all her prompts from CIE. Unable to make up her own mind, like some helpless, hapless bystander, she stood idly by while the positions of the warring factions, the company and the drivers, became more entrenched. Finally after the company had lost £11 million, the economy of the provinces had been devastated, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission were both called in to do an evaluation of the train drivers grievances and immediately the strike was called off. The question everyone is asking and I ask again tonight is why this initiative could not have been taken at the start. Why wait until such permanent damage is done to all the interests involved?</P>
    <P>Last week's industrial action could also have been averted. On 19 April, the Minister received a letter from the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, outlining their grievances and requesting that they be examined and addressed. The Minister looked at the letter and decided it was not for her and did not even acknowledge it. She then passed it on to the Taoiseach which seemed to be a way of guaranteeing that nothing would happen, and typically nothing did happen. I wonder why it took three days of chaos before the national implementation body stepped in and the strike was suspended.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be the prophet of doom but I am very strongly of the opinion that we are not talking about the strike being over but simply about it being suspended. I genuinely fear that it is more than probable that worse industrial action will follow unless an acceptable compromise is arrived at and I would not be optimistic about the prospect of such a development.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of taking the side of the trade union movement. I do not believe the unions have covered themselves with glory in their performance within CIE. There are serious industrial relations problems within the CIE company and its subsidiary bodies, and they are not all on the union side. The failure to confront them, or to simply address them with temporary &ldquo;band aid&rdquo; solutions, is running away from reality. There are serious problems with the way Iarnród Éireann is being managed.</P>
    <P>The mini CTC signalling debacle speaks for itself &ndash; a £15 million rail safety contract which will now cost the taxpayer, the Minister for Finance and the people of this country not £15 million but £52 million with not a single one of the 28 stations yet equipped with the new system. How any Minister for Public Enterprise can continue to preside over such incompetence by a company which she owns on behalf of the citizens is mind-boggling.</P>
    <P>The company gets more than £100 million to run its services and instead of a modern service appropriate to the fastest growing economy in Europe, all we have are slow, old locomotives, <Col N="281" /> many of which were bought in the 1960s and which regularly break down, carriages which are too few, outmoded and over-crowded and where wheelchair passengers are accommodated in the freight wagon with no toilet facilities. Instead of taking action the Minister seems simply satisfied to whistle past the graveyard and refuses to take on management and demand the delivery of a better performance and the re-shaping of industrial policy in order to end once and for all the epidemic of strikes which has blighted the company and driven the commuter back to his car, disaffected and hostile to public transport.</P>
    <P>The same Micawber-like ineptitude is again exemplified by the Minister's failure and refusal to tackle the industrial malaise within Aer Lingus. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has presided over the worst phase of industrial action within our once-proud national carrier. For the past nine months every single section within Aer Lingus has been on strike or engaged in varying forms of industrial action. The baggage handlers have been on strike on more than one occasion, the caterers have been on strike on more than one occasion, and the pilots have lodged a pay claim in order to give them parity with their colleagues in the one world alliance. The 1,650 Aer Lingus cabin crew staff grounded all flights leaving 20,000 passengers stranded and costing the company £2 million per day. Eventually the cabin crew got their pay demand. Within days 3,000 ground staff went on strike in support of their catch-up claim with their colleagues in the cabins. Again all flights were grounded. Some 20,000 passengers were stranded and the company lost £2 million per day and again the ground staff got their pay demand.</P>
    <P>Like CIE and Iarnród Éireann a major fear is that the industrial peace that may have descended on Aer Lingus is now short-term because of inter-union rivalry between IMPACT and SIPTU. Until such time as the Minister insists on the company developing an interlocking agreement where all the parties would accept relativity, there will be no permanent peace within the Aer Lingus company.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Public Enterprise told us that the Aer Lingus flotation is to go ahead now that the industrial relations problems have been, as she put it, sorted out. The Minister cannot be serious. Any Minister for Public Enterprise who seriously considers that Aer Lingus is an attractive proposition for flotation, with 6,000 staff, a huge need for capitalisation and investment and in the wake of the recent disastrous industrial relations record, is not living in the real world. Apart from the performance and state of health of the company itself, one has to ask how much confidence would there be in the marketplace to put a further State utility on the market, offering investors a chance to invest in an enterprise where the Minister for Public Enterprise had made such a debacle of the Eircom flotation, where the shares were over-priced and over-sold, leaving thousands of shareholders, <Col N="282" /> many of them first time investors, not alone dismayed but at a serious loss.</P>
    <P>In early April, 550 ESBOA and SIPTU key employees in the ESB warned they would pull the plug on Marino, Moneypoint and Poolbeg unless they got a 28% pay increase. Again the Government and the company capitulated. I am sure the ASTI and the other unions are avidly watching that capitulation.</P>
    <P>From 1922 to 1998 the Garda Síochána had stood steadfastly by the State by never resorting to industrial action, notwithstanding the fact that such action would be illegal. However, when the members of the force marched to Leinster House in 1996 they were embraced by the then Opposition spokesman on justice, Deputy John O'Donoghue, who gave them to understand that in government there would be no problem. In government there was a major problem. For the first time ever there was the historic but sad first blue flue. Again the Government capitulated to the wage demands.</P>
    <P>The nursing profession is probably the most perpetually extolled and deified but underpaid profession. Always expected to be responsible, they were forced for the first time ever to mount a national strike. The nurses got their pay demand and nobody begrudges it to them. However, one has to ask why the all-important Nursing Commission was not established much earlier.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the PPF is in tatters. Last March the State's largest Civil Service union rejected by 87% the 2% cost of living increase in the PPF. It quotes house prices, for example, which since 1974 have increased by 1,916% and GDP of 2,171%, yet clerical officers pay increased by only 801% in the same period. In 1974 two clerical officers could afford to buy an average priced house, today the combined average incomes of two clerical officers would leave them with absolutely no hope of owning a house. Yesterday we had the news that the Association of Higher Civil Servants is seeking pay increases in the order of 25% to 40%.</P>
    <P>The predicted 4.5% annual rate of inflation could now be well over 5%. It is entirely home-grown inflation as a direct consequence of a Government unable or unwilling to lead or to manage its own affairs. Drink price have increased by 5.6%, food inflation is running at 7.7%, its highest since 1984. Transport costs, motor insurance costs, fuel, car maintenance, telephone charges, child care and medical fees have increased substantially, yet the Government refuses to listen let alone act. What a pity. What a tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the name of Deputy Higgins and my Fine Gael colleagues. The current strike numbers throughout the country in various vocations represent a serious problem for the future economic development of the country. I refer particularly to the rail strike of last week which caused severe problems to busi<Col N="283" /> ness, commerce, enterprise and various vocations in many sectors of the economy, in particular, the tourism industry which had been on its knees for months in the aftermath of the foot and mouth disease. The consequences of such strike action are enormous, not only the actual losses by virtue of people not being at work, late for work, cancellation of important meeting and missing important commercial deadlines, a form of paralysis which is unacceptable, but added to this is the image abroad portrayed by the chaos and the message we have sent as a country to potential investors and to those non-nations on whom we rely for our international trade. This does not give a clear bill of health to our economic standing and it is a matter of major concern.</P>
      <P>I accept that last week's rail dispute was unusual in that it resulted from an inter-union wrangle. Given the changes throughout the trade union movement in recent years, this is the type of dispute that will give rise to future concern. It must be regarded as being important in the context of the manner in which we treat our industrial relations. Employers can take little comfort from the type of inter-union strife of last week and a process needs to be established to deal with this precise issue. It was disappointing that the Minister, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on Tuesday of last week, threw her hands in the air and said that, as Minister, there was nothing she could do. Her performance last week was at best uninspiring and at worst negligent.</P>
      <P>On Thursday of last week &ndash; the Taoiseach refused on Wednesday to become involved &ndash; we were told by sources in the Taoiseach's office that the strike was suspended due to the intervention of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair. Surely this is the greatest irony of Irish political life that the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Taoiseach could not get involved, yet the British Prime Minister's office claims involvement and part resolution so far as postponement of the industrial action was concerned. The Minister for Public Enterprise as sole shareholder showed a distinct lack of leadership on this regrettable issue. Over the weekend the Tánaiste moved matters a stage further by saying she favours legislation to outlaw the taking of strike action. This is most unwise and is a recipe for industrial chaos. Rather than banning strikes by way of legislation a voluntary code of practice should be agreed by the social partners to maintain essential services throughout the State.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago the LRC sought to address this problem and since then no progress has been made on this issue. This represents a significant draw-back in social partnership. The maintenance of essential services is vital to avoid chaos throughout the economy, and huge loss and damage to business, enterprise and commerce will ensue until such time as a code of practice is agreed. Last week's rail dispute showed that an inter-union wrangle could have scuttled the entire partnership programme and paralysed the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> There is a clear duty on the part of Government, employers and unions to commit themselves towards reaching agreement on appropriate codes of practice to ensure the maintenance of essential services at all times. The taking of strike action must be seen always as a last resort.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government, the social partners and the LRC to put in place appropriate safeguards necessary for dealing with disputes in services where strike action or interruption could endanger life, causing major damage to the national economy or widespread hardship to the community, in particular, health services, power and energy supplies, water and sewerage services, fire, ambulance and rescue services and public transport. These safeguards should be introduced through consultation and negotiation on a voluntary basis and should include an undertaking that strike action will not be taken. In this regard it is timely to acknowledge the tremendous work of the Labour Court under the chairmanship of Finbarr Flood, particularly in recent difficult times, and, similarly, the Labour Relations Commission, its chair, Catríona Murphy, and chief executive, Mr. Kieran Mulvey. While we accept that new pay guidelines are needed in spite of the benchmarking process to sustain the current social partnership model, there is a corresponding duty on all concerned to promote the concept of industrial peace and harmony and an advanced code of practice for dispute procedures is vital.</P>
    <P>We will only have a peaceful industrial relations climate if we can introduce a greater level of flexibility to the pay elements of social partnership. As the Minister for Finance knows better than anybody else, the PPF came under severe strain before it was even printed and distributed. We had a problem with inflation which now gives rise to even greater concern than at the conclusion of the PPF last year. These are crucial concerns as workers in many vocations rightly believe they have not secured their fair share of the benefits of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>In order to address the current unrest, the Government, trade unions and employers need to tackle the issue in a co-ordinated way and we must look at other options which have not been looked at in the manner they might have been. One avenue worth pursuing is gain sharing. Such a model would allow a new approach to pay and the industrial relations process which would see wages rising largely in line with GNP on an annual basis. The mechanism would include an inflation linked increase and an annual lump sum linked to the growth of the economy on a yearly basis, added to which would be a scheme of deferred compensation. Unless we look at such new options, we will be forced into a free-for-all, which would not be in the interests of the people or the economy. Gain sharing should be looked at as a serious alternative.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, referred to privatisation which is regarded as a significant plank of the Government's economic policy. The only precedent we have is the Eircom debacle <Col N="285" /> where, at the invitation of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in partnership with Mr. Ray MacSharry, the public was sold a pup. We were told to go and buy shares and invest like never before, resulting in a huge loss of confidence in the whole system. Small investors have lost considerably because of a negligent misrepresentation on the part of the Minister in tandem with a former ministerial colleague. How will the Government portray Aer Lingus as a suitable candidate for flotation and ask the public to subscribe if the only precedent we have is the Eircom debacle where the public was led up the garden path? </P>
    <P>The absence of leadership in this area is very worrying. The Government has taken its collective eye off the ball and we are now paying the price in industrial relations difficulties, a climate of uncertainty, rising inflation and rising job losses of an unexpected type due to sources not entirely within our control, but nevertheless real. We have at the same time a Government which appears to be somewhat semi-detached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I am glad that the Minister for Finance is present to listen to the debate. Yesterday on national television he addressed the nation and impressed upon it the need for value in the provision of public services. In this context, I remind him of the rail line which runs through his county from Dublin through Maynooth and on to Mullingar. I am not sure how familiar he is with it, but we, in Mullingar, are very familiar with it. A considerable amount of money was spent on upgrading it. The signalling equipment was upgraded at a cost of millions of pounds, continuous track was provided and, most importantly, to provide a better service for the commuter, a double line was installed from Maynooth to the city. While tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been expended, no additional services have come on stream. This is because CIE management failed to negotiate with the workers and introduce work practices that could bring improved services into play.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that taxpayers' money should have been expended without negotiating with the workers in parallel in order that, when the infrastructure was put in place, the improved services could come on stream at the same time. That would have been logical and sensible, but, unfortunately, that did not happen. Commuters from Mullingar board the train at 6.45 a.m. and if they are lucky, they will arrive in Dublin at 8.30 a.m. With the improved services that should be in operation, it should be very attractive to travelling commuters to leave their cars at home and travel with Irish Rail. It is very disappointing that those services have not come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister with responsibility for the public sector has stood back and done nothing. It was outrageous to hear her say on radio recently that she could do absolutely nothing about the matter. A caller to a talk show later the same morning asked the reason we have a Minister with <Col N="286" /> responsibility for rail services if she can do nothing. Should she not be made redundant? That question needs to be answered. If the Minister is not prepared to create a climate in which to resolve the difficulties, why bother having a Minister? Why not let Irish Rail and Bus Éireann run their own businesses and work matters out themselves? </P>
    <P>The teachers dispute has dragged on for a long time and looks like continuing in September. For its own reasons, the ASTI decided to opt out of the PPF and wanted to negotiate a separate deal. However, the Government stayed out of it stating that it was not its problem, that it could not negotiate with the ASTI. The poor innocent victims, children in second level schools, lost out. Many are heading into examinations without the groundwork and preparation that would have been expected at this time of year. It is unfair that many of the children concerned will be at a decided disadvantage to those who attended grind schools or the schools unaffected by strike action. Unfortunately, the Government did not do the decent thing and work out a package with the ASTI.</P>
    <P>All strikes eventually need to be settled. We saw what happened with the gardaí, nurses and junior doctors. Early intervention by the Government would help to minimise the disruption. We are now witnessing further difficulties in Aer Lingus where it looks like we will have regular stoppages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this important debate. The motion is a clear attempt by the Opposition to express real concern at the serious and continuous industrial unrest, particularly in the public sector, leading to a long list of costly and painful industrial disputes in the last two years, and the undermining of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to which each industrial dispute contributes. It also attempts to express concern at the Government's handling of a series of industrial disputes involving gardaí, teachers, nurses, junior doctors, bus drivers, train drivers, taxi drivers, Aer Lingus cabin crew and handling staff, etc., who have felt obliged to take industrial action to increase pay or improve working conditions. Perhaps most importantly, the Fine Gael aim is to express concern at the Government's short and medium term policies which have contributed to inflationary pay demands, and the failure of the Government to deal with the underlying causes of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 18 months there has rarely been a week in which there has not been strike action or an industrial dispute of some sort in the public sector. The idea behind the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is that structures and assurances are put in place to avoid industrial disputes. To this end, the partnership has failed us thus far. Fine Gael supports the concept of partnership between Government, employers, employees and the social and voluntary pillars as a sensible way <Col N="287" /> of anticipating disputes before they arise and to ensure realistic targets and demands are set down on issues such as pay and working hours. However, if a partnership agreement is to succeed, the Government must take on its responsibilities by adopting responsible and prudent policies to avoid crises which have a knock-on effect on workers, such as has happened in the health service where working hours and conditions for nurses and junior doctors in particular have become unacceptable and have been so for some time. This has led to a long and bitter nurses' strike with a potential conflict with junior doctors in future.</P>
    <P>The same responsible attitude to fiscal policy must be adopted by Government in controlling inflation, perhaps the biggest threat to the PPF. Employees in the public sector will not continue to work in a progressing and successful economy if their wage increases do not comfortably cover the increase in the cost of living. In the past two budgets the Government got its inflation estimates wrong. Already this year estimates are having to be revised upwards. Last year an inflation figure of 3.5% was predicted before the budget, which was constructed to reflect that figure. However, the final figure was closer to 6% by the end of the year. This is the kind of fundamental error which fuels industrial unrest and increases wage demands as well as unrest in the social and voluntary pillar and adds to instability in the economy. No doubt last year's inflation figures will be blamed on factors such as oil prices and the increase in interest rates which are outside the control of the Government, and there is some merit in that argument. This year, there are no such excuses and inflation is again beginning to rise alarmingly. At budget time in the past two years the Minister for Finance did not take any real or comprehensive steps to control inflation. Instead he has opted for the popular option of a give-away budget, which had the sole aim of putting more money in people's pockets, thereby fuelling spending capacity and fuelling inflation. The criticism of his fuelling of an already strongly burning economy was not confined to Opposition benches in this House. Our partners in Europe have also expressed real concern at budgetary fiscal policy in Ireland over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Government's handling of industrial disputes has done nothing to defuse or end them. In some disputes it has chosen to do nothing, as in the case of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, last week. Where they have got involved, as in the case of the nurses' and ASTI disputes, the attitudes and comments of the Government have increased tension in certain circumstances. An example is the decision by the Minister for Education and Science to dock pay from all ASTI members before last Christmas. This decision only served to prolong a bitter dispute which has not yet been sorted out.</P>
    <P>In fiscal policy and industrial relations, the Government has shown itself to be irresponsible <Col N="288" /> and out of touch at times. If the PPF is to have a realistic chance of survival, the Government must play a more responsible and prudent role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is timely. When one considers the industrial relations scenario preceding it one wonders how serious the Government is when it talks in its amendment of an ongoing commitment to ensuring stability in industrial relations. This is in the context of a Minister recently saying she could do nothing. It is almost like Manuel in the television series &ldquo;Fawlty Towers&rdquo; where he continually says &ldquo;I could do nothing&rdquo;. It is symptomatic of a malaise which seems to have afflicted the Government in the context of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was valid but seems to have been used as a launching pad with regard to further extending the pay process and getting increases. The malaise is symptomatic of the public service more than the private sector compared to the 1970s and 1980s. Last year the ILDA strike &ndash; which I deplore as it was called by a small body of people &ndash; held the entire country to ransom for ten weeks, but it could have been resolved very quickly if there had been positive intervention and recommendations to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, which got involved after ten weeks. Tourism was badly affected as a result, particularly in rural areas. The bad old times of the past are coming back to haunt us.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a series of industrial disputes under the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. In Aer Lingus there has been a continuation of disputes which do not do any good for the country or its reputation. I am sure the impression of many people who use our international airports must be of an economy which is fairly sick, given the magnitude of the industrial relations problems. I do not think it augurs well for the future when a Minister decides to go the route of privatisation for Aer Lingus, as we did with disastrous consequences with Eircom. At that time people bought shares based on false expectations which were fuelled by Ministers in deliberate propaganda to encourage them to buy shares. We know how disappointed shareholders are, something we were reminded of at the annual meeting held a short time ago, and by the current share price. One wonders about Aer Lingus and the disputes which have affected it.</P>
      <P>In the long running dispute with the ASTI the Government seems totally incapable of acting. Therefore, to talk about an ongoing commitment to ensuring stability in industrial relations is a bit of a misnomer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a difficulty in that, even with increased prosperity and everybody talking about the Celtic tiger, we have disputes which seem symptomatic of the public service. We must analyse the reason for this. Much of it is due to economic policies of the Government which have escalated house prices out of all <Col N="289" /> proportion, making it impossible for people to buy houses. In many cases increased expectations have been fuelled as regards wages and salaries. What has happened to bring about such difficulties in terms of housing? The Government called in Peter Bacon to examine the issue. However, in recent times there have been increased difficulties in the house building sector. We had a recent meeting with the Construction Industry Federation. There is now a decrease in house building, particularly in the private sector, with a very limp policy in regards local authority housing, with more people on the housing waiting lists. All this is creating problems for workers who in many cases see industrial action as their only hope of getting an increase in wages.</P>
    <P>The Government has not shown leadership. When the current Taoiseach was Minister for Labour, there was intervention by the Government. However, in recent times there has been a malaise in terms of industrial relations, fuelled in particular by the Government.</P>

      <P>This motion has been tabled at a time of unprecedented growth and development in the economy. Our economy continues to be one of the most successful in Europe. Growth is set to continue at rates well above the EU average and we have a strong employment performance. I cannot accept that Government policy is inflationary. At budget time, I announced an anti-inflation package to counter inflationary pressures. This package included, first, direct taxation measures to increase participation in the economy and thereby ease the labour shortages which contribute to wage pressures, second, cuts in indirect taxes to bring down the inflation rate and ease transportation costs and, third, measures to encourage consumers to save rather than spend. I remind the House that in November inflation, as measured by the CPI, stood at 7% but had <Col N="290" /> fallen to an annual rate of 5.6% in April of this year.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came to power, we have successfully managed the public finances as a foundation for future growth. Significant budget surpluses have been maintained since 1997 and the plan is to continue to run significant surpluses in the future. In addition, we have substantially reduced the debt to GDP ratio below 40% from the 90% plus levels a few years ago. We are also making significant provision for future pensions liabilities. While there are, of course, significant challenges facing the Government &ndash; this time we are concerned with the sound management of success &ndash; these can be met in the spirit of social partnership, with all sectors acting in a responsible and realistic manner.</P>
      <P>Ireland has matured and prospered through the maintenance of solidarity on key areas of national importance. The important enabling factor in all this has been social partnership. It has not only injected strategic direction into national policy development and implementation but has provided stability, which is vital for competitiveness, investment and employment. While facilitating our drive for prosperity, partnership has also demonstrated the capacity to respond imaginatively and flexibly to changed circumstances and new imperatives. The partnership process has never been a static one. Indeed, it would not have survived as long if it had been. Adhering to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will achieve the twin goals of maintaining economic competitiveness and delivering real increases in take home pay for both workers and social welfare recipients. Through this process future Irish economic growth will be maintained and the benefits will be ensured for all our citizens.</P>
      <P>In an adjustment to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed on 4 December last, a national implementation body, representing Government, IBEC-CIF and the ICTU, was established to ensure delivery of the industrial stability and peace provisions of the PPF. The body, which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, serves as a forum where the Government, employers and trade unions can work together to help ensure a positive industrial relations climate for economic and social progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new body has been actively involved in assisting in the resolution of a number of industrial disputes, including in the construction industry, Aer Lingus and, most importantly, Iarnród Éireann. The body has already clearly demonstrated its value in supporting the work of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission in the industrial relations arena. It has also demonstrated in practical terms the continuing commitment of Government and the main employer and trade union organisations to industrial peace and stability. The national implementation body also takes a forward-looking perspective in seeking to anticipate and redress potential <Col N="291" /> industrial relations problems. It has briefed the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission on the application of the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This will further assist in delivering industrial peace and ensuring adherence to proper procedures.</P>
    <P>Another key innovation provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was the establishment of an independent public service benchmarking body. The background to the establishment of the body is that public service employers and unions recognised that the traditional approach to pay reviews in the public service, based on analogues and relativities, had given rise to serious difficulties in the past. They agreed that an alternative approach was required which would be grounded in a coherent and broadly-based comparison with jobs and pay rates across the economy.</P>
    <P>The benchmarking body was formally established in July 2000. As well as examining pay rates, the benchmarking body will examine and compare existing roles, duties and responsibilities in the public service and across the economy. It is to report by 30 June 2002. The two features which distinguish the benchmarking body from what has been done in the past are that it will look at all the main groups at the same time and have a strong, well resourced and fully independent research function. I take this opportunity to stress that the benchmarking body is fully independent.</P>
    <P>While it has invited submissions from the relevant parties and will hold oral hearings in due course, its research, deliberations and recommendations are entirely a matter for the board itself. The independence and expertise of the body is reflected in its composition. The benchmarking body is chaired by a High Court judge, the Honourable Mr. Justice Quirke, and its members are Mr. Billy Attley, former General Secretary of SIPTU, Mr. John Dunne, former Director General of IBEC, Mr. Phil Flynn, former General Secretary of IMPACT, Ms Maureen Lynott, Management Consultant, Mr. Paddy Mullarkey, former Secretary General, Department of Finance, and Mr. Jim O'Leary, Chief Economist, Davy Stockbrokers. While anyone can have his or her opinion or expectations about what might emerge from the benchmarking process, it is the benchmarking body alone which will decide on the appropriate recommendations, not anyone else, not Ministers, Departments, trade union leaders or any other body or individual.</P>
    <P>One of the major disputes to face the public service in recent years is the action by the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland in pursuit of its claim for a 30% pay increase. The current situation is that ASTI has rejected Labour Court recommendations and clarifications, but has lifted its ban on co-operation with the State exams. The background is that ASTI did not accept the PPF. It left the Irish Congress of Trade Unions during the talks. The ASTI claim has been rejected by its <Col N="292" /> own sectoral industrial relations machinery, the Teachers Arbitration Board, which is independent. It has also been rejected by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>At all times the Government has agreed to participate in any process that would solve this dispute. We have abided by the findings of the Teachers Arbitration Board and we have paid pay increases to ASTI members. It is open to ASTI to reconsider its stance even at this stage and join the other teachers' unions in making their claims for an increase to the independent public service benchmarking body. This is the avenue agreed between all the parties as providing the best way of approaching public service pay and ensuring orderly evolution in the sector. Otherwise we will return to the days of leap-frogging claims and unions chasing each other in pursuit of &ldquo;relativities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government as employer has remained firm in its determination to ensure the PPF is not breached. The Government resisted enormous pressures in the interests of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the economy and stability in industrial relations overall.</P>
    <P>In the Civil Service, the Civil and Public Service Union has rejected the adjustment to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed between the employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in December last. However, this has not led to any form of industrial action. I understand that the union has deferred, until the autumn, consideration of possible steps to be taken. I am glad to note that the CPSU is engaging with the benchmarking exercise. The CPSU has made a submission to the benchmarking body and has been given a copy of my Department's submission to that body.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus management has been negotiating with all sections of the workforce in relation to claims on pay, pensions and working conditions. In their negotiations with unions, Aer Lingus accept that there is a low pay issue in the airline that needed to be addressed and has sought to address this over the past year. A number of claims involving clericals, operatives, pilots and cabin crew have given rise to disputes which resulted in industrial action being taken. The industrial action varied from two hour stoppages to 24 hour stoppages which led to the suspension of Aer Lingus services. Talks are continuing at present in relation to the remaining claims from staff in Aer Lingus, with the assistance of the State mechanisms.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the industrial relations difficulties in the company have been exacerbated by the inter-union rivalry between IMPACT and SIPTU. The national implementation body of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has, on a number of occasions, expressed serious concern at the industrial action taken in Aer Lingus. This Government fully shares the view of the national implementation body that these strikes, which led to the shut down of the airline, inconvenienced <Col N="293" /> customers and damaged tourism and trade, are not in keeping with the commitment to industrial peace in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We expect all parties to the PPF to live up to their commitments, with employers abiding by the pay increase proposals and unions complying with the industrial peace clauses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ESB, let me make it clear that there has been no industrial action resulting in interruptions to power supplies and all demands for power supply continue to be met. ESB management and unions are currently involved in a detailed round of negotiations to agree the nature and extent of the changes required to work practices, central to which is agreement to the unlimited use of outside contractors. These talks, to be finalised by 31 May 2001, will be followed by a &ldquo;roadshow&rdquo; and ballot of ESB staff in June. The results are expected to be available by the end of June.</P>
    <P>There are currently no major industrial issues outstanding in Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann. Iarnród Ereann is experiencing a number of difficulties associated with extensive restructuring negotiations. Iarnród Éireann management is currently in negotiation with a number of different unions in relation to this change process. The discussions are at various stages of the agreed industrial relations process.</P>
    <P>With a view to securing recognition within the CIE group of unions, the Irish Locomotive Drivers' Association earlier this year became a branch of the ATGWU, which had not previously represented train drivers, and that union has now sought such recognition on their behalf. To press their case, ATGWU held a number of one day strike actions around the country last week. The national implementation body intervened and proposed that the issues in dispute be separated into two categories. These are (1) procedures for dealing with individual disciplinary matters in Irish Rail and (2) inter-union relations and union representation of train drivers in Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>The national implementation body requested the Labour Court to investigate the issues in category (1) and to invite the parties to an early hearing. The investigation would be for the purpose of recommending on the fairness or otherwise of the procedures employed in Irish Rail in respect of disciplinary cases in dispute, with reference to the code of practice on grievance and disciplinary procedures. The Labour Court agreed to convene an early hearing, provided further planned strike action was called off. The issues in category (2) will be dealt with by a disputes committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. ATGWU has now voted to support the national implementation body proposals and the threatened actions have been called off. This shows that the initiative taken by Government within the PPF has been effective.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to a reformed and modern health service is clear from the vastly increased resources allocated to the sector, from work which is being done in the framing of a <Col N="294" /> health strategy and from a number of detailed reviews of various aspects of the health services which have been undertaken. The recent reports of the Medical Manpower Forum and on the 48 hour week for junior doctors have significant implications for the provision of health services in the future. A new priority action plan on the implementation of the core recommendations of the Commission on Nursing has been agreed recently. This covers the period 2002-03 and follows the plan for 2000-01 which provided funding of £22 million. A major investment has been made in clerical and IT support, which will free first line nurse managers to manage efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>With regard to increased resources, health spending has been increasing at an extraordinary pace in recent years. Having reached £2 billion for the first time in 1994, gross expenditure rose to £3 billion in 1998, to £4.4 billion in 2000 and to £5.4 billion in the Revised Estimates volume provision for 2001. It is thus now running at well over three times the level of ten years ago. Over the same period, staffing levels have increased from less than 60,000 to an authorised total of 86,500 for 2001. In the current year alone, we have allowed for almost 7,000 additional health sector employees.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify, for the benefit of the House, that the junior doctors and nurses are not engaged in industrial action at present. The nurses' organisations have recently expressed concern that other public service workers, that is, teachers, might have an advantage in the benchmarking process. Let me again reiterate most firmly that the benchmarking body is entirely independent. It will undertake a comprehensive examination of jobs and pay across the public service and make comparisons with jobs and pay in the private sector. The benchmarking body will make its recommendations on the basis of its own research and findings and will not be influenced by others.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the programmes of change and restructuring in the ESB and the CIE group. In the public service, the modernisation programme is making an important contribution to sustaining our economic and social development. A modern flexible and responsive public service is at the core of shaping our future and guiding our progress. Steady progress has been made in modernising the public service since the mid-1990s. I have already mentioned the work of the independent benchmarking body. This exercise involves much more than a pay review in the traditional sense.</P>
    <P>The report of the benchmarking body will also help to inform future pay determination for the various groups within the Civil Service and the wider public service and the nature and extent of the linkage to ongoing change. The flexibility to recruit, develop, retain and reward people at appropriate levels with the appropriate skills and competencies is central to the new public service envisaged under the strategic management initiat<Col N="295" /> ive. The nature and extent of further changes in all these areas of the modernisation programme will be informed by the outcome of the benchmarking process.</P>
    <P>In summary, apart from the ASTI dispute, there are no disputes involving straightforward pay claims over and above the terms of the PPF at present. Furthermore, Government has made clear and effective provision for the conduct of industrial relations and the resolution of disputes in accordance with the terms of the PPF by setting up the national implementation body and by using the well established industrial relations machinery of the State. The Government has also moved to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service by devising and implementing ambitious programmes for change and modernisation. In the longer term, this should contribute to stability in industrial relations by introducing appropriate and agreed changes.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I believe that the strength of our social partnership approach has been based on the realism of the partners. We have been realistic about Ireland's place in the global economy, recognising the need to adapt to what we cannot change and the need to change things under our control in line with the needs of the time. We have been realistic about the interdependence of all of us who live and work in this economy. We have been clear too about the need for consistency in behaviour and policy if our shared goals about prosperity and fairness are to be achieved.</P>
    <P>All of us bear the responsibility for ensuring that these goals are achieved. We must continue to adhere to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which provides the essential framework for sustaining the country's economic and social progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion. The Opposition's motion demonstrates a failure to recognise the benefits that the economic and fiscal policies of the Government have brought to the country. We must discuss this motion in the context of the successful and sound economy which currently exists in Ireland. It is an economy enjoying growth rates well above the EU average. I welcome the economic and budgetary objectives employed by the Government over recent years which have brought about this success. Those objectives are to manage our economy to secure our continued prosperity, to improve our quality of life, to promote a fairer society, to introduce ongoing tax reform to remove low incomes from the tax net, to reduce the tax burden, especially on middle incomes, to increase the incentive to work and to help reduce inflationary pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last four budgets delivered by the Government have provided an economic and budgetary outlook of which we can be proud. We expect that economic growth will average 6% between <Col N="296" /> 2001 and 2003. We expect employment to expand by an average of 2.5% over each of the next three years and unemployment to decline. We expect inflation to be approximately 2.5% by 2003, a general Government surplus to average 4.2% of gross domestic product and a 5.3% annual average increase in capital investment between 2001 and 2003. That is the success story we have enjoyed since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>We have also seen record employment over recent years, with 300,000 new jobs created. We have witnessed a reduction in unemployment from 10.7% to 3.6% and we have also seen a reduction in the long-term unemployed from 4.6% to 1.2%. The live register has dropped by 44% since the Government took office &ndash; the current figure is about 135,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>This is the economy we enjoy today. We have a Government that is prepared to put money into the national pension reserve fund to fund pensions for today's workers. We have the second lowest national debt in Europe. We have the fifth social partnership programme, with increases in net take home pay of up to 25%. Some 23% of all new US mobile investment in Europe locates in Ireland despite the fact that we represent only 1% of the population. Ireland as a country has moved up to fifth place in the global competitiveness report. By anyone's account it is a great success story and this is the context in which we should examine this motion. That is the picture of the Irish economy as seen throughout the world.</P>
    <P>If we were to look at that success story and compare it to what happened when the Opposition was in government, whether in terms of social inclusion measures, social welfare payments, care for the elderly, child benefits or any sector, the success of this Government would probably leave the Opposition red-faced and embarrassed. That is why this motion appears to be an element of desperation on the part of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the budget measures that were taken, particularly in the last budget, to tackle inflation. The Government is particularly conscious of the need to keep inflation under control and to prevent it from taking root in the economy. Inflation would devalue the savings of pensioners and the incomes of people on welfare. It also damages our competitive position as an exporting nation and, if left unchecked, would threaten the foundations on which our economic prosperity is built. This is not happening under this Government. The rise in inflation over the past year was primarily due to a lot of external factors beyond the control of any Government. The sharp rise in oil prices and the devaluing of our currency have pushed prices up right across the economy. The Government has taken active steps and has demonstrated its commitment to combating the problem. We have done that by reducing the standard rate of added value tax and reducing excise duties on petrol and diesel. Any other excise increases which might have been expected in the budget have been forgone. All <Col N="297" /> these measures have had a significant impact in bringing down the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>In addition to that the Government has brought about reductions in personal taxation which underpin social partnership and help control inflationary wage demands in the economy. Anybody who has carried out an independent forecast tells us that the rate of inflation is set to reduce significantly. The package of anti-inflationary measures introduced in the budget will help make that happen. When we look at the Opposition motion we must distinguish between short-term fiscal measures designed to take the sting out of inflation and the long-term measures required to increase the productive capacity of the economy. We are looking at the long-term situation while we recognise that at times short-term measures have to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government has also introduced measures to encourage consumers to save rather than spend. This has been received positively by the public. It is an innovative step. I welcome it and believe it will have a significant impact on inflation. Already the measures taken in the last budget have seen inflation fall from 7% in November to 5.6% by April.</P>
    <P>If we look at partnership programmes we must acknowledge that they have had a huge role to play in the success of our economy. What we have achieved through these programmes is agreement on economic and social priorities, a sharing of the benefits of growth in our economy, stability in industrial relations and certainty on pay. There is a responsibility on all parties to co-operate if we are to maintain and sustain this success story. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is a comprehensive and agreed programme for continued economic and social progress. This programme is the basis of our fiscal and budgetary strategy and is fundamental to the continuance of the success we have enjoyed over recent years.</P>
    <P>The programme is innovative and forward-looking. It makes provision for public service reform by linking the final increase of 4% to change. In addition, it has provided for the setting up of the benchmarking body. This is critical to the programme's success. It will ensure that people get a fair day's pay for their work. I welcome the benchmarking process as an independent body which is chaired by a High Court judge and set up to compare pay and jobs across the public service with pay and jobs in the private sector. I look forward to its report on 30 June 2002.</P>
    <P>There was an amendment to the programme in December 2000 which provides for the national implementation body under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach to monitor the working of the agreement and to intervene where necessary to resolve issues emerging &ndash; we must recognise that issues will emerge from time to time. There will be pay disputes and it is important to have structures in place to handle those issues. The Government has achieved suc<Col N="298" /> cess by putting structures in place to handle any issues arising.</P>
    <P>In his address the Minister dealt with most of the disputes currently in existence. I do not wish to repeat what he said. The ASTI dispute is the only one which involves a pay claim over and above the terms of the PPF. It is important that the Government remains firm and I doubt the Opposition would disagree on that. If we are to retain our success there must be no departure from the terms of the PPF. The benchmarking body will provide a mechanism for the teachers to pursue their claim. Teachers should be better paid but they can achieve that through benchmarking.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues relating to change and restructuring in CIE and the ESB are being addressed within established industrial relations procedures. In addition, the national implementation body recently set up has intervened to resolve issues arising in Aer Lingus and the construction sector. We have the structure in place to deal with the concerns of workers. Therefore, I reject the motion put forward by the Opposition and I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Stagg and Rabbitte.</P>
      <P>I was told the Minister for Finance wanted to take this debate. I was puzzled at that and, having listened to what he said, am baffled as to why he took the trouble to do so. The first section of his speech was the recitation of the economy's success going back to the time of Methuselah or slightly afterwards, something which is on all the word-processors in the Department of Finance. Then he gave a list of current industrial disputes with a trite explanation of the Government's current line. Nothing he said gave any indication that he is aware that the public service is bordering on, and getting rapidly to, a state of crisis. Nothing indicated that he understands public servants' feelings, of being undervalued and unable to afford a house which was regarded as a basic until a couple years ago. Nothing he said indicated that he understands the difficulties, to put it mildly, afflicting the partnership process. Why he came in is beyond me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He recited such trite nonsense as &ldquo;the Government has also moved to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service by devising and implementing ambitious programmes for change and modernisation.&rdquo;  Our problem is that the Government has done nothing of the kind. It committed itself in principle to an SMI process but in practice has failed to deliver. It has also failed to engage seriously with the public sector trades unions. We are a long way from implementing what the Minister describes as his ambitious programme of change. We have to start this debate with a reality check on where we stand. We have a public service with different problems afflicting it at different levels. There is a serious low pay problem affecting grades such <Col N="299" /> as CO and CA. It is shameful in the current state of the economy, as recited by Deputy Cooper-Flynn, that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs pays some of its own employees family income supplement. That has to change and no partnership agreement excuses it. At other levels, as is known, skilled professionals leave in droves and, more importantly, it is increasingly difficult to encourage anyone with professional skills into the service.</P>
    <P>Effectively the PPF is dead, as is partnership as we have known it these past 13 or 14 years. I agree with most commentators in saying that we owe a significant part of our economic progress in this period to the partnership process, but we must recognise that the sell-by date has arrived. About 50% of the private sector has got wage agreements in excess of what is provided for in the PPF. Virtually every significant body of public sector workers wants increases beyond it. For what it offered employers, public service managers, in terms of certainty of pay and other things, the PPF is dead in the water. It did not get going in the first place and we would do ourselves a service by acknowledging that because then we can look to see where we go from here.</P>
    <P>There will be other partnership agreements, but the next one will not deal with wages with the same certainty as this agreement. There are many reasons for that, not least of which is that Government must bring something else to the table. Over the past 13 years, all the social partners and parties in this House broadly accepted the principle that Government brought tax cuts. That will not be so for the next few years. There is scope for further income tax reductions but nothing like what it has been. Therefore the Government's capacity is reduced. We should acknowledge that in the private sector corporate profits are much higher. Looking at the PE ratio or the absolute value of profits reflected in the tax we get, corporations and employers are doing well. In the near future, they must take greater responsibility for ensuring that workers are paid better. Government will not be able to, and should not, subsidise as it has done. There will be collective bargaining in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking in the public sector is important and innovative. I compliment and support the social partners who agreed it with Government. A reading of the terms of reference is useful. The level of misunderstanding of them is considerable. Modernisation of the public service must be key. Many public sector workers are unable, or fail, to understand what the process entails. Most of them are likely to be better off at the end of the process, but it is not sufficiently appreciated that it is also likely, if not certain, that many traditional and historical relativities will be broken. The process must be done in one tranche with one report that the Government acts on immediately. It must be independent, researched independently and according to terms of reference that we all understand. It is a good, positive pro<Col N="300" /> cess which I hope is not derailed or misrepresented as it has been recently by people with particular interests.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes in public service and that the State must invest in it for and into the future. That means well paid, well motivated public servants. It cannot mean continuing to shovel all of the additional investment only into public sector pay. It means if we pay more money, we must get a better service. I have pushed that on my party's behalf in recent years. We need to establish a genuine partnership with public servants. They need to know they are valued. They need to be well motivated and to know that Government wants to work with them. They also want and need to know that Government is committed to the service they deliver, and wants to see measurable improvement in that service in times of economic wellbeing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn mentioned inflation. We must get on the line that inflation is 5.6% and was at 7% a few months ago but almost all of that reduction is accounted for by the fact that the increase of 50p on a packet of cigarettes, in December 1999, is out of the system. Other than that, inflation has been at the same unacceptable level for six months. Nothing in the past three months has made a difference &ndash; not the reduction of 1% in VAT or of excise duty. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong. The Minister touched on an interesting fact which he should have highlighted. That expenditure on the health service has increased by almost 100% hides that much of it has not impacted yet and that much of the increase is only in the current budget. In my budget speech, I acknowledged a significant shift from controlling and dampening down public expenditure and a refusal to invest. There was a last minute pre-election shift to spend extra money. Of the £2.4 billion extra or so that this Government is spending, £1 billion is committed for this year and, of course, most of that has not been spent. When the Minister said we will not see, or we have not seen, an impact, it is really far too early to judge. That is an argument of which we will hear a lot more in the future. We have a serious problem within the Civil Service and the public service and the first thing which Government must do is acknowledge it and then to look to work with the trade unions and the other social partners to work it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion tabled by Fine Gael. The term of office of this Government has featured the worst industrial relations crisis the country has seen since the 1980s. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness negotiated 18 months ago was supposed to guarantee industrial relations peace. This agreement had to be renegotiated last December and again the new arrangements agreed under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach were also supposed to provide the illusive key to industrial peace. Instead, we have seen steadily deteriorating industrial relations <Col N="301" /> which show no sign of improving and have all the indications of getting worse.</P>
      <P>During the lifetime of this Government we have had major strikes involving the Garda, we had the first ever national nursing strike, we have had strikes in Dublin Bus, DART, Irish Rail and multiple strikes in Aer Lingus. We have had a strike involving members of the ASTI which was seriously mishandled by the Government and has left students doing crucial exams this summer at a serious disadvantage. Only a few weeks ago, we narrowly avoided a major strike in the ESB which would have led to serious disruption in supplies. There is simmering discontent at the level of low pay in the Civil Service with the union representing most of the low paid public service workers having rejected the revised PPF terms and is now threatening action. The ASTI dispute is not over and schools are likely to face renewed problems in the autumn. The dispute which led to the withdrawal of rail services in different parts of the country last week is far from over. The appalling conditions in our hospitals have led to threats of renewed action by nurses and non-consultant junior hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons for the current level of industrial unrest. People see quite clearly that all people have not benefited equally from our unprecedented level of economic growth over the past decade. Workers who were asked to accept modest levels of increases have seen directors of their own companies rake in increases many times the level of inflation. Recent figures suggest that my neighbour in Kildare, Michael Smurfit, makes £4,150 per day. Tom Mulcahy, who runs Allied Irish Banks, earns just £3,640 per day, yet tens of thousands of workers earn just about the national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour.</P>
      <P>Workers who were asked to accept modest increases have seen the benefits of their extra few pounds eaten away by inflation and have seen the Government fail to honour its repeated commitments to keep inflation under control. On the basis of the inflation figures published last week, yet again this year workers will see the value of their increases eaten away. People are simply running faster than ever simply to stand still. People are working harder than ever, taking more time than ever to get to and from work and are finding it more difficult and more expensive than ever to find somewhere to live. At the same time all around them they see others not subject to the same constraints making huge amounts of money. Is it any wonder there is dissatisfaction and disenchantment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has consistently failed in its responsibility as an employer to ensure that all those it employs receive decent levels of pay and that they work in acceptable conditions. Many of those in the Civil Service, particularly at the lower level, received levels of pay that are simply shameful. We are now all paying the price for this as the rapid exit of staff back to the private sector leads to a deterioration of services in the public service. Many employees of the semi-State com<Col N="302" /> panies work in unacceptable conditions because of a failure, in many cases, to provide adequate funding to these companies and to ensure that management is up to scratch.</P>
    <P>I want to see industrial peace and harmony. We need to address the underlying problems of low pay, poor conditions and the general level of alienation and disenchantment. This is a long-term project. In the shorter term we need acceptable procedures for identifying potential industrial relations flash points and defusing situations before they get out of hand. What is particularly alarming in the current situation is the total absence of any coherent strategy for dealing with industrial relations problems or restoring industrial peace, nor is there any sign of anyone in Government being willing to take charge of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is the Minister with overall responsibility for industrial relations but she shows no obvious interest in the area and seems content to leave it to her junior Minister who, quite frankly, does not inspire confidence and is known in the House as the man who voted against his own Bill. Indeed, the Tánaiste's recent statements that the right to strike should be made illegal speaks volumes as to where she stands. It is amazing that this debate tonight which is directly within her remit is being taken by the Minister for Finance rather than the Minister with responsibility for industrial relations and labour, the Tánaiste. It is amazing that she, or even her junior Minister, is not in the House.</P>
    <P>Many of the disputes to which I have referred have been in public sector companies for which the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has responsibility. Her unpredictable and inconsistent approach has succeeded only in alienating management and unions. The Minister cannot seem to make up her mind whether she is in charge of this sector. When the delivery of a new bus or carriage provides a photo opportunity, the Minister has no problem elbowing her way to the front but when there is an industrial relations problem, she goes to ground and washes her hands of any responsibility. Indeed, her on/off privatisation proposals have engendered uncertainty and real fear for the future among workers and has worsened already poor industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, owes most of his political reputation to his record as Minister for Labour when he successfully brokered solutions to a number of very difficult disputes but he too has given the impression of a man who just does not want to know when we have had disputes in recent years.</P>
    <P>More than 2,000 disputes were referred to the Labour Relations Commission last year. It is barely able to cope because of staff shortages and inadequate resources. That is what this Government is doing to try to deal with the disputes at that level. The result of this collective abdication is drift and, often when it is too late, crisis man<Col N="303" /> agement. Somebody has to take charge. We have to look at the resources available to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Nobody disputes the difficult nature of many of the disputes we have seen over the past few years but what is most alarming is the total lack of any urgency on the part of the Government and the apparent willingness to see the country drift into industrial relations chaos.</P>
    <P>Repeated industrial disputes have the capacity to do untold damage, especially against the background of the slow down in the Irish economy, the problems of the hi-tech sector, the serious problems of the US economy and a worrying increase in the underlying trend of unemployment. This must not be allowed to happen. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste must do the job for which they were elected. They must take charge and devise a coherent strategy for the restoration and maintenance of industrial peace.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising this matter and the Minister of State for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>Enniscorthy received the bad news at the weekend that Wexal Limited was to close at the end of July with the loss of 150 jobs. It came as a great shock to the workers, the business community and the people of the town. Enniscorthy has only three overseas companies, the largest of which is Wexal in which many of the people employed are young people with mortgages. It has come as a major blow to them that they will now be out of a job.</P>
      <P>Enniscorthy has suffered severely in recent years. Last year we had the closure of Wennas and Minch Norton, and now have this shattering blow with the closure of Wexal. There has been very little support from the IDA or the Department. We have twice the national unemployment rate and the highest youth unemployment rate in County Wexford, but despite repeated requests for support from the IDA, it has never been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we had a meeting in Dublin with representatives of the IDA which was not very productive. They talked about the advance factory which is to come on stream and said that Wexford and Enniscorthy were a priority. If the fact that there has been no industry and no job creation in Enniscorthy in the past three or four years is not a priority, I would hate to see what is. The way we have been treated in recent years is an absolute disgrace. Despite high job creation in the country, we have not received our fair share of the national cake. Of about 1,500 jobs created in the south east in the past two years, not one came to <Col N="304" /> Enniscorthy. Very few came to County Wexford. That is unacceptable to me as a public representative from that county. We deserve our share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>During the years we were told by the IDA that we did not have the infrastructure in Enniscorthy. We engaged in urban renewal, built new hotels, a new swimming pool, a new cinema and new sewerage schemes. We extended the sewerage scheme to the industrial site on the Dublin Road. We have all the infrastructure in place and still nothing has happened. Enniscorthy has had an unfair deal in recent years. What is needed is for the advance factory to proceed immediately. We need the IDA to purchase a land bank in Enniscorthy and, most important, we need a replacement industry for Wexal.</P>
    <P>This situation cannot be allowed to continue. Most of those employed in Wexal are young people with young families. They have bought houses in recent years at between £80,000 and £120,000. They have major mortgages and no hope of getting a job for the future. I ask the Minister of State to use all his influence with the IDA and the powers that be to ensure a replacement industry is obtained for Enniscorthy in the near future and that the advance factory and the purchase of lands will proceed without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I regret the announcement by Wexal International Limited of its intention to cease production in Enniscorthy where it has provided valuable employment during the past 24 years and contributed greatly to the economic life of the Wexford region. The announcement came as a great shock to those concerned. The company currently employs 150 people, of whom 35 are temporarily laid off.</P>
      <P>Wexal has had several owners during its long history. Its current owner is Alcoa of Switzerland which acquired it in May 2000 as part of its takeover of the Reynolds Metals Company. Alcoa is primarily a producer of aluminium. Wexal manufactures aluminium tubing for automotive and engineering applications.</P>
      <P>On 10 May, Alcoa announced its intention to close the Wexal extrusion plant in Enniscorthy by the end of July 2001. The company stated that the reason for the closure was that the plant was finding it increasingly difficult to compete in terms of production costs with its competitors in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the closure announcement, FÁS has been in contact with the company with which it has been agreed that a number of FÁS employment services officers will meet all the staff to interview them on an individual basis before the proposed closure date. FÁS guidance and counselling interviews will address the question of jobs and training at the interview stage. Depending on the <Col N="305" /> requirement needs of the staff, suitable training courses will be run and every effort made to find alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The company initiated a consultation process with employee representatives on 10 May to ensure an orderly closure. It has given a commitment that it will explore all areas to help employees during this difficult period by offering out-placement support and transition support services, such as training opportunities for new jobs. It will also consider various aspects of the plant closure with the local community, customers and suppliers and deal with their concerns with integrity and respect.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities nationwide. For this reason, it has ensured the strategy underpinning the national development plan will be driven by a strong emphasis on attracting high value added projects and balanced regional development. The development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed accordingly.</P>
    <P>We are acutely aware of the need to develop employment in the Wexford area and to encourage industrial development in the south east region. Following a report completed by Peter Bacon and Associates, entitled, County Wexford: A Strategy for Economic Development, which highlighted the constraints for future development in the county, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment established the Wexford Enterprise Initiative with the aim of assisting local interests to identify means of promoting a greater level of industrial investment, including the attraction of mobile international investment to the Wexford region. On 31 March 2000, we received the report of the initiative. It set out a very comprehensive blueprint for the development of the county and makes recommendations across a wide number of investment priorities. To turn it into reality will require a spirit of collaboration, commitment and self help from all those involved. The implementation of the report is being undertaken by a sub-group of the county development board. Its successful implementation will do much to improve the environment for enterprise in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Arising from its involvement in the Wexford Enterprise Initiative, IDA Ireland has developed an integrated marketing strategy for the county with a view to increasing the level of inward investment. This strategy includes a focused sectoral and geographical approach for new greenfield business, coupled with an added value focus for the existing base of overseas industry in the county. It will also include a comprehensive upgrading of IDA Ireland real estate in the county and the provision of new modern facilities to cater for emerging sectors. In relation to Enniscorthy, IDA Ireland proposes to upgrade the five acre industrial site to business park standard. A local community based group has been awarded a BES certificate by IDA Ireland to con<Col N="306" /> struct an advance factory on the site. IDA Ireland, in conjunction with Wexford County Council, is continuing to seek suitable additional land for a new business park. In addition, Wexford Community Development Association and Enniscorthy Enterprise and Technology Centre are being grant-aided under the community enterprise centre initiative which is managed by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. These enterprise centres are aimed at meeting the needs of local communities and assisting them in establishing new start-up businesses.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the strategy will position the county to significantly increase the level of investment. IDA Ireland will work towards addressing the various impediments to new inward investment identified in the report of the Wexford Enterprise Initiative, namely, support infrastructure, particularly telecommunications, and skills availability. The Deputy can be assured that the Government and the development agencies will do their utmost to secure alternative employment opportunities for all the workers affected by this unfortunate closure in Enniscorthy.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for this timely opportunity to address a most urgent matter affecting the pupils, parents and teachers of the junior convent school, Castleblayney, and other schools around the country. There is anger and dismay at the proposed forced abolition of the middle infants grade at primary level. Schools have been sent a cold and remote circular from the Department of Education and Science that takes no account of the real needs of real children, a circular that has been greeted with alarm in many homes and classrooms.</P>
      <P>The casual and uninvolved reader of today's newspaper story on this issue might be tempted to regard it as a technical matter but nothing could be further from the truth. The Department's proposed course of action will cause real hardship to people who are already suffering economic, social and educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is middle infants? It is an additional grade after junior infants which provides a necessary space for pupils who are not yet ready for senior infants. It is particularly important for schools and communities where disadvantage is concentrated. Castleblayney is a prime example. It is one of the most disadvantaged towns in the entire country. There is a lack of economic development, a high level of long-term unemployment and a disproportionate level of social problems such as early school leaving, teenage pregnancy and child sexual abuse. In the words of the principal of the junior convent school: &ldquo;We have children who are suffering depression, children who have attempted suicide and children whose parents have committed suicide. We have <Col N="307" /> children who are living in very poor conditions due to dysfunctional home management.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The post-primary school which is on the same campus has been officially designated as having disadvantaged status since the early 1990s. When the current Minister's predecessor, Deputy Martin, met the representatives of the junior convent school he said he was at a loss to explain why their school did not also have disadvantaged status. He recognised that it was vital to break the cycle of educational disadvantage as early as possible as many of the pupils never achieve a second level qualification. He promised to rectify this under the Department's new deal but there was disappointment that the school received only £2,660 from this scheme.</P>
    <P>The junior convent school in Castleblayney is due to be allocated two new teachers in September because of an increase in numbers. The principal now states that if middle infants is abolished the school will lose those two teachers in two years and also possibly one other teacher. Parents will have to be told before the holidays in June whether their children can do middle infants. They enrolled their children last year thinking that this grade would be available to them and over 20 have requested middle infants for their children this year.</P>
    <P>There has been a middle infants grade at the junior school since 1975. Every year since then middle infants has catered for between 20 and 25 pupils. Parents make the final decision in consultation with staff regarding the placement of children in this class. Teachers and parents are unanimous in their support for the retention of this class and in their belief in its proven success. The existence of the middle infants grade shows an understanding of and compassion for the needs of children, particularly the most disadvantaged. Crucially it takes into account their need and their right to make progress and to be seen to make progress. It eliminates the psychologically damaging sense of being &ldquo;kept back&rdquo; which exists when pupils are simply retained in junior infants for a further year.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reverse the proposed course of action which would lead to the axing of middle infant classes in Castleblayney and elsewhere. Pupils are not mere numbers on roll books. They are children with individual needs, living in communities which also have unique needs. If middle infants is to be removed then it must be replaced with the early start scheme in all affected schools. Either way a three year infant programme is clearly needed in many schools. Above all there must be flexibility and understanding and I urge the Minister to show those qualities now.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy): Arís, I am pleased to have to address the House on the staffing position in the junior convent school, Castle<Col N="308" /> blayney, and the retention of the three year infant cycle.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the staffing of a primary school is always determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The enrolment of the junior convent school on 30 September 1999 was 161 pupils. This enrolment warrants the staffing of a principal and five mainstream class teachers for the 2000-01 school year. The enrolment on 30 September 2000 increased to 182 pupils and this enrolment will warrant the staffing of a principal and seven mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year, an increase of two mainstream class teachers. In addition, their school has the services of a shared language support teacher, a shared resource teacher and two special teachers for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>I will outline the position with regard to the middle infants year. The primary curriculum is designed as an eight year course and there is no official programme for a middle infants class within the curriculum. The policy of the Department is that children who are over four years of age should be enrolled at the beginning of the school year and commence in junior infants. I am aware that there is a tradition in some schools whereby pupils are enrolled for a number of days prior to the summer vacation to facilitate them in adjusting to school life.</P>
    <P>After spending a year in junior infants, pupils should progress on to senior infants and spend two years overall in the infant cycle, not three. As a general rule, pupils should progress from one standard to a higher standard at the end of each school year. In recent years our Department has allocated considerable support for pupils with learning difficulties in schools. Learning support teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants and a wide range of resources under the various schemes for schools in areas designated as disadvantaged, are among the forms of provision allocated to schools for these pupils. I am confident that the level of provision available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school in keeping with their peers.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there may be individual cases where a principal teacher, following consultation with the learning support teacher and class teacher and parents of the pupil, concludes that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for a second year. In such cases our Department would favour the retention provided there is an educational basis for same, along with a clear programme for the pupils to follow. I also direct the Deputy to the fact that it is the long standing policy of our Department that when it becomes aware of the existence of a middle infants class to inform the particular school to cease this practice. In this regard, our Department recently issued a circular to schools outlining the official policy in relation to the retention <Col N="309" /> and promotion of pupils. This policy was already outlined in rule 64 of the Rules for National Schools and in a previous Department circular, 10/67. The circular, Primary Circular 11/01, which was recently issued, reaffirms the official policy in relation to the retention and promotion of pupils within all schools throughout this country.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin-Monaghan Bombing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. The following quotation from Don Mullan's book on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is an appropriate introduction to my contribution:</P>
      <P>Only those who have been intimately touched by the brutality remember, often traumatically, the consequences of an uninvited, unimagined and unexpected violent intrusion into their lives. Unlike a snapshot, which captures a moment in time, the maimed, bereaved and those left to cope often face a never-ending nightmare of torment and deepening sadness.</P>
      <P>This sums up the feeling of those left behind in this instance. I appeal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in view of the resumption of the inquest into the deaths caused by the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, to ensure the Government will provide the necessary finance to enable the families of the victims, represented by Justice for the Forgotten, to establish a family service support centre in Dublin as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Among the core functions envisaged for the family service support centre in addressing the victims and families' unmet needs will be to provide a personal support service to bereaved relatives and the injured in the context of a family service support programme under the guidance of a suitably qualified programme director, to provide a meeting point and a point of contact for bereaved relatives and the injured, to act as an information resource for families and to co-ordinate responses to elements of the report of the Victims Commission not yet addressed. Support must be provided for individual unmet needs, for families during resumed inquests, for victims of atrocities committed on the island as a whole who are resident in the State and for families during the hearings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights looking into the report of the independent commission. The annual commemorations must be assisted, as must the construction of memorial monuments in Monaghan and Glasnevin cemetery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family services support programme will focus initially on the effects of the bombings on the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health of bereaved family members and identified survivors. As inquests of the independent commission of inquiry resume and public hearings progress, it is expected that many more survivors <Col N="310" /> will connect and ally themselves with Justice for the Forgotten and that witnesses to the bombings will come forward to share their experiences of that day. When that happens, the focus and services of the programme may be reassessed and readjusted to meet changing needs.</P>
    <P>The family service support programme should be housed in a convenient physical space where family members would feel free to drop in for a chat at any time, spend time alone or with other members and feel they have a genuine space of their own to come to. I was recently in Derry and I dropped into the centre established for relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday. The families were certainly positive about the services provided in the centre as they helped them considerably.</P>
    <P>I recently asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a Dáil question on this matter for written reply, requesting funding for this service. On 1 May, I was informed as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the particular needs of the victims and the relatives of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. In that context, and in addition to the work proceeding on developing an implementation plan in respect of the recommendations in the report of the Victims Commission, an application received from the Justice for the Forgotten group for assistance towards a family support centre is under urgent examination.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to indicate clearly that he intends to provide this funding. I understand that this matter will be considered by the Cabinet shortly.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that those involved have been ignored for too long as they have been neglected by successive Governments. It is time their feelings and aspirations were recognised. The Government should respond generously as the resources exist. I understand it would cost about £160,000 to set up this centre, which is a small amount. I appeal seriously to the Minister to view the application sympathetically and to press very hard for it when it comes before the Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this important matter. The bombings in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974 were unspeakable atrocities which resulted in the greatest loss of life in any day of more than 30 years of conflict. Those killed, injured and bereaved were innocent victims of truly appalling violence. We are now in a period where, more and more, violence is rejected and peace embraced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement provides a real opportunity to achieve lasting peace, but it acknowledges that in securing peace we cannot and must not forget the victims of violence. The section of the Agreement dealing with reconciliation and the victims of violence recognises their suffering must be acknowledged and addressed as <Col N="311" /> an essential element of reconciliation. The Agreement also recognises the importance of providing services that are supportive of and sensitive to the needs of victims.</P>
    <P>In line with such commitments, I established the Victims Commission in May 1998 to review the services in place to meet the needs of those who suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Ireland over the previous 30 years. The commission was to identify what further measures needed to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering and concerns of victims. My Department provided the staffing and other resources required by the commission, the sole member of which was the former Tánaiste, John Wilson.</P>
    <P>The commission's report sets out with great sensitivity what the victims of the conflict told Mr. Wilson. Building on what he was told by the victims as well as by voluntary groups and official bodies, he made a series of wide-ranging and ambitious recommendations, almost 50 in all, covering many different areas. He addressed the issues of dealing with the emotional trauma suffered by the victims and the provision of financial support to both past and future victims, although we pray we will never see victims of such violence again. He made recommendations regarding medical issues which have arisen and those in the service of the State who have become victims. He made recommendations for alleviating the plight of displaced persons and those who suffered economic loss, and he addressed the need for awareness and sensitivity to victims' needs and concerns.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson also specifically addressed the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, recommending that a former Supreme Court judge be appointed to carry out a private inquiry. In line with this recommendation, an independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings was established in December 1999 to undertake a thorough examination, involving fact-finding and assessment, of all aspects of the bombings and their sequel. This inquiry was to look at the facts, circumstances, causes and perpetrators of the bombings, the nature, adequacy and extent of the Garda Síochána's investigation, and the reasons no prosecution took place.</P>
    <P>The then recently retired Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, agreed to undertake the inquiry, as well as a similar one into the Dundalk bombing of 1975. Due to ill-health, Mr. Hamilton was forced to resign in September 2000 and was succeeded by Mr. Henry Barron, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. Sadly, Mr. Hamilton died soon after. I would like once more to record my appreciation, and that of the Government, for the significant work carried out by the late Mr. Hamilton on these commissions.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the completion of Mr. Barron's work. The result of his examination of the issues will be presented to the Government, to be followed by an examination of the report in <Col N="312" /> public session by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. There has been continuing close contact between the Department of the Taoiseach and Justice for the Forgotten in connection with this inquiry.</P>
    <P>In addition to these inquiries, the report's recommendations cover a wide range of areas within the competency of a number of Departments and agencies. To allow Departments and agencies maximum flexibility, many of Mr. Wilson's recommendations are formulated in general terms. The relevant Departments and agencies have examined the recommendations to see how they might best be implemented to the maximum benefit of those whom they are intended to help. Deputies will appreciate that this work is quite complex but I expect shortly to be in a position to bring to Government proposals on a framework plan for the implementation of the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that Justice for the Forgotten, which represents the victims and relatives of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, submitted an application for assistance in establishing a family support centre to provide a personal support service for those injured and bereaved in the bombings and their relatives. The application is for £162,000 a year to cover premises, equipment and staff made up of a therapist, a full-time facilitator, a part-time facilitator and an administrator. Justice for the Forgotten recently met the secretary general of my Department to discuss this application and, more generally, the implementation of the Wilson report. Following a positive and constructive meeting, I considered very carefully the case made by Justice for the Forgotten for assistance for the proposed family support centre. I concluded that Justice for the Forgotten had made a strong case which deserved the fullest consideration in the light of the recommendation of the Wilson report for financial assistance to voluntary groups for counselling for victims of violence.</P>
    <P>Those injured and bereaved and their relatives have suffered greatly and have had to live for many years with the dreadful consequences of the bombings. The report of inquiry currently being undertaken by Mr. Barron into the bombings, whatever its findings, and the consideration of the report by the Oireachtas committee, will undoubtedly revive many painful memories and emotions for the victims and their relatives. I will shortly submit to Government a memorandum, taking into account all the factors I have outlined, on the application for financial assistance for a family support centre and I expect to be in a position to inform Justice for the Forgotten of the Government's decision in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise a worrying trend highlighted by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's report yesterday, which <Col N="313" /> shows a significant increase in the number of calls to its help line While some of the increase recorded by the centre is attributable to the fact that more people are coming forward for advice, the reality also is that the incidence of rape and other sexual crimes are increasing. This trend is reflected in the figures of other Rape Crisis Centres around the country and in the official Garda statistics. During the period from 1992 to 2000 the number of rape and aggravated sexual assault cases returned for trial increased by 265%.</P>
      <P>A recent report by Women's Aid has similar serious revelations with regard to domestic violence with 10,110 such incidents reported to the Garda in 1999. Women in Limerick were warned earlier this year against walking alone in the streets because they risked being attacked. Random and vicious attacks on both men and women have become a feature of modern Ireland. While the alarming increase in violent and sexual crime is acknowledged officially, there does not appear to be an effective strategy in place to deal with it. I welcome the presence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and call on him to translate the zero tolerance rhetoric into action to protect the growing number of women and men who are vulnerable. The appalling trauma and distress suffered by victims of such crimes must have an effective response.</P>
      <P>The report of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women published in March 1999 made a number of recommendations of a practical nature &ndash; which have not yet been fully implemented &ndash; particularly in relation to prevention, extending the network of support and reforming the way in which cases are dealt with once reported. The Rape Crisis Centre's figures indicate that only one in five victims of rape ended up reporting the assault to the Garda. I have no doubt that fear and lack of confidence in the legal process is a major reason for this. The delay in bringing cases to court is inexcusable. It frequently takes a year or more before the victim even knows whether the State will take a case. It can then take another year before it comes to court. In the meantime and throughout the legal process the complainant may get little or no information about what is happening as she or he is treated as just a witness for the State, which is the central protagonist.</P>
      <P>Social and family pressures to keep it quiet can be overwhelming as victims very often know their assailant. This along with fear and trauma and uncertainty can win out over the need for justice in the long time the whole process takes. This must be urgently addressed. We have all read of many cases which collapse, perhaps on a technicality, and do not succeed. One was reported today which was quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal because of certain information that became available in relation to a jury member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital data are co-ordinated. Geraldine Connolly, head of clinical services at the Dublin <Col N="314" /> Rape Crisis Centre, said yesterday that the incidence of sexual violence is almost impossible to estimate. A research project should be established to gather and co-ordinate available information. It could also invite submissions and provide a safe forum for victims to tell their stories so that we can understand the obstacles to pursuing justice and inform public policy and action.</P>
    <P>I want to address the issue of date rape and the use of drugs such as Rohypnol. This came to public attention again recently in the tragic case of the death of a young Irish farmer on a weekend trip to Prague. This and similar drugs need to be subject to stricter controls. The French government recently introduced such measures. Information from Rape Crisis Centres indicates that the use of such drugs for the purpose of sexual assault is increasing in Ireland. I urge the Minister to take urgent measures to address all aspects of this disturbing issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will know, I am concerned about any increase or perceived increase in crime, in sexual crime in particular.</P>
      <P>As the figures released yesterday by the Rape Crisis Centre point out, the incidence of sexual offences is difficult to quantify accurately. We should remember that a variety of offence types are being discussed here. We cannot assume that all of these offences increase or decrease in a uniform way.</P>
      <P>To take just one example, child sexual abuse made up 51% of the calls to the centre's crisis line which could be categorised. Some 89% of those cases, however, had occurred more than a year before. The House will be well aware that some cases of child sexual abuse that have been reported in recent years can go back a number of decades. Because of the high number of historical cases now coming to light, we should be cautious about how we interpret statistics in this category of crime.</P>
      <P>The ongoing work of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, which is chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is making a vital contribution in addressing the needs of those affected by sexual crime. The network of rape crisis centres and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre are both represented on this committee. The committee has held a number of awareness campaigns aimed at encouraging women to come forward and report incidents of violence, including rape and sexual assault. The committee has also endeavoured to raise awareness in society that such violence is a crime and it must stop. I am confident these campaigns will equally benefit the male as well as the female victims of sexual assaults. I record my deep appreciation of the outstanding work of the Minister of State on this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the increased incidence now being reported results, in part, from these awareness campaigns and if that is the case this development is to be welcomed. Crimes of viol<Col N="315" /> ence, regardless of the relationship between the perpetrator and the victims, should no longer remain hidden. It is vital we encourage victims of sexual crimes to come forward and receive treatment in a caring and sensitive manner.</P>
    <P>The rape crisis centre's report also contains valuable information on the number of cases reported to the Garda Síochána and the outcome of them. The figures indicate that sexual offences are most likely to be reported if they are recent, and if they are committed by strangers, as opposed to persons known to the victim. In response to concerns over the progressive reduction between the number of crimes committed and the number which end in conviction, I recently commissioned and launched a study on Attrition in Sexual Assault Offence Cases in Ireland. This important study is part of my Department's ongoing research programme into aspects of the criminal justice system and is another example of my intention to improve the response of that system to victims of sexual assault.</P>
    <P>Most regrettably the number of rapes reported to the Garda in recent years has steadily risen. While some of the increase may be explained by reference to historical factors, there has been undoubtedly an increase in the willingness of victims to come forward and report the offence. This is something we should all encourage. Unfortunately, it also appears to be the case that there are still a number of rapes which go unreported. In order to provide an effective deterrent against sexual offences, I recognise we must ensure the criminal justice system, and those outside it with a part to play, respond to the special needs of rape victims and make it easier for cases to come to court. Because the prosecution of rape cases presents particular difficulties for the victim, we must ensure a range of measures are in place to respond promptly and sympathetically to the victim's needs.</P>
    <P>The discussion paper, &ldquo;The Law on Sexual Offences&rdquo;, which I published in 1998, provided an <Col N="316" /> opportunity for legislative stock-taking, following the many welcome and positive changes in recent years to the laws governing sexual offences. The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, now nearing completion of its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, is the first fruit of that stock-taking exercise.</P>
    <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, introduces radical new measures to deal with those who commit sexual offences. It also introduces, for the first time in our law, separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases during applications to adduce evidence or cross-examine on the complainant's past sexual history. This measure shows the determination of the Government to do all it can to encourage the victims of these crimes to report and participate in the prosecution of those responsible.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána and, in particular, the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit liaise with Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country and encourage early reporting by victims who contact the centres. In addition, the Garda Síochána research unit at the Garda Training College, Templemore has had a number of workshops with the Rape Crisis Centre and other NGOs on reconciling the statistics on sexual offences produced by the various agencies involved so as to more accurately assess the levels of reported sexual crime.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures put in place by my Department, I understand that the Department of Health and Children increased the funding to the service providers dealing with the issue of violence against women to £8.3 million in 2001 from its original level in 1997 of £3 million. No doubt this will benefit the range and level of services in all regions. I am satisfied that the measures currently in place will greatly assist in addressing the problems of sexual crime and I assure the House that I will keep the subject under review.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 May 2001.</P>

      <P>The inventory management system, IMS, is currently being implemented across the national defence network as a computer based system. The system runs on an Oracle database version 8.1 using Forms version 6.0. The underlying hardware platform is a Compaq TRU 64. The system is currently accessible by 450 users in 25 locations. The scope of the IMS covers procurement, subhead management, requisitioning, ordering, invoicing, tax clearance certificates and supplier information. Inventory relating to aircraft and Reserve Defence Forces is outside the scope of the IMS. The estimated cost of the project over ten years is approximately £3.5 million, divided between hardware, software development and licences.</P>
      <P>The system provides the Defence Forces with the ability to carry out its logistic and supply function in an effective and efficient manner, freeing resources for other duties.</P>

      <P>On 27 April 1981, an observation post in south Lebanon manned by Private Hugh Doherty and Private Kevin Joyce of Irish Battalion came under attack. Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing. Some equipment was also missing. The attackers are unknown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that efforts to obtain information on the whereabouts of Private Joyce have been ongoing since his disappearance. I have raised the matter with the Israeli ambassador and the matter has also been pursued by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Palestinian authorities. During a meeting in the Department of Foreign Affairs in August last year, the then Palestinian representative to Ireland, the late Dr. Youssef Allan, undertook to pursue the matter <Col N="319" /> with his authorities. The Department of Foreign Affairs has also asked the Representative Office of Ireland to the Palestinian Authority, Ramallah, to make inquiries with the Palestinian authorities there. The EU special representative to the Middle East peace process, Ambassador Moratinos, has also been advised on the case by the Department of Foreign Affairs and asked for any assistance he may be able to provide.</P>
    <P>During my visits to UNIFIL I have taken every opportunity to raise the issue both with Government and local representatives and with the Lebanese media. In addition, each successive Irish Battalion since 1981, including the present battalion, has been tasked with pursuing the matter.</P>
    <P>With the imminent withdrawal of the Irish contingent from Lebanon later this year, my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are giving high priority to the ongoing efforts to locate the whereabouts of Private Joyce and bring this tragic incident to a conclusion. In April 2001 Private Joyce's brother and sister visited the scene of the incident in south Lebanon.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 174, 188, 189, 202, and 203 together.</P>
      <P>The sale of six barracks identified as surplus to military requirements is being progressed. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is in the process of being sold to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000 and it is hoped that the formalities of this sale can be completed in the very near future. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas UDC and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000, all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing.</P>
      <P>The Castleblayney property is in the process of being sold to the North-Eastern Health Board for £600,000 and it is anticipated that sale contracts will be signed in the near future. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board last year on foot of that agreement. The legal formalities to complete the sale are progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the largest of the barracks concerned, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of last year for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan. Discussions are ongoing between Cork County Council and my Department to determine the best way forward to realise the potential of the integrated plan, while taking account of the aspirations of all sides. It is hoped to bring the matter to conclusion at an early date.</P>
    <P>The vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In view of those needs, it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of the property. However, this matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated in the near future when alternative accommodation becomes available. My Department, following a tender competition, has appointed selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, to offer for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001, the barracks of 13.65 acres.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing properties, agreements have also been reached for the sale of the following.</P>
    <P>1.07 acres at Arbour Hill to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>6.39 acres known as &ldquo;Susan's Field&rdquo;, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork to Cork Corporation for £1.2 million.</P>
    <P>3.0192 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, to Limerick Corporation for £915,000.</P>
    <P>1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks to Waterford Corporation for £550,000.</P>
    <P>20 acres of the Curragh lands to Kildare County Council for £215,000 to assist with the construction of the Kildare by-pass.</P>
    <P>The disposal of ten acres at Mellows Field beside Renmore Barracks, Galway will proceed as soon as is practicable, while 100 married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare will be sold to residents, which will realise approximately £3 million.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, many of the properties are destined for disposal to local authorities in recognition of the increased needs for building lands being experienced by those authorities. A number of smaller surplus properties are also being sold to various individuals at present. In the past three years, 21 properties have been disposed of <Col N="322" /> by my Department. The bulk of those disposals is made up of the sale of 11 houses at Magee Terrace, Kildare Town, adjacent to the former Magee Barracks.</P>
    <P>The costs associated with the sale of the six Barracks identified for disposal in 1998 are</P>

    <P>Savings to date on military security duty allowances alone amount to £882,000 approximately. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which would have amounted to approximately £150,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks. Contingent on closing dates for sales, additional costs will arise in respect of the sale of barracks.</P>

The moneys raised from the sale of the six barracks earmarked for disposal in 1998, and those additional surplus properties since identified, will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify any confusion arising from the description of the capabilities for the EU headline goal, a voluntary target which EU member states aim to meet by the year 2003, as a rapid reaction force. The response capacity currently being developed by the EU, and frequently described as a rapid reaction force, is emphatically not a standing army. Rather, it constitutes a catalogue of capabilities to be available by 2003 to provide the means to carry out Petersberg Tasks &ndash; tasks of crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities &ndash; the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor.</P>
      <P>Ireland has offered to contribute up to 850 members of the Defence Force to the headline goal from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations stand-by arrangements system. The largest element of the commitment involves a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel, along with an Army ranger wing platoon of 40, in addition to small numbers in national support, headquarters and observer elements which make up the remainder. Participation in any potential EU Petersberg Tasks operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, will be considered on a case by case basis and Ireland will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act (1954), the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act (1960) and the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993.</P>
      <P>The Government, contrary to misguided speculation, remains determined to continue to contribute actively to UN peacekeeping. Our future contribution will take into account the changing and more complex nature of peacekeeping, which involves additional tasks such as humanitarian assistance, the protection of human rights and civilian police work. The commitments made in relation to the EU headline goal must be seen in the context of Ireland's long-standing support for overseas peace support operations authorised by the United Nations. It is a lesson of the appalling events in the Balkans that we need to be able to move quickly and effectively in response to humanitarian crises. In its emphasis on cooperation, and not on confrontation, the new patterns of security cooperation reflect values which have always been at the heart of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the Amsterdam Treaty, as approved by the Irish electorate in May 1998, that defined the operational focus of the EU on tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management, the so-called Petersberg Tasks. Based on the provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, the Union's practical approach in this area was guided first by the Cologne European Council in June 1999. Then, through decisions taken at successive European Councils at Helsinki, Feira and Nice, the Union has gradually set up decision-making structures so that it can undertake humanitarian and crisis management tasks. Ireland, in common <Col N="324" /> with our partners in the EU, is participating in these structures and can bring a great deal of expertise to bear. In particular, we can offer the wide experience we have acquired in the humanitarian and crisis management area through our participation in UN missions. In this way, we can play a constructive role in promoting peace and stability in Europe.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the White Paper on Defence, published last year, sets out key elements of the Government's approach to overseas peace support operations and I wish to refer to a number of the most important and relevant elements. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for a reshaping and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared for the opportunities and challenges of the changing security and defence environment. This strategy embraces organisation, equipment, training and technology aspects. In this context, the White Paper contains the strategy for the Defence Forces strength and organisation for the next ten years and concluded that the Permanent Defence Force requires a strength of 10,500 personnel, ready to fulfil current tasks at home and abroad. On military training, the White Paper recognised that the primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged in operations, is training and preparation. As a reflection of the evolving defence and security environment, increased emphasis will be placed on exercises stressing interoperability, procedures and doctrine. As regards the financial position generally, the White Paper acknowledged the trend for many overseas peace support missions to be financed by the participating countries. While this may increase the overall net cost of overseas operations in a situation where the proportion of missions with a reimbursement facility declines, the general strategy for the management of the Defence Vote within existing resources will set the context for all defence programmes, including overseas operations. The White Paper on Defence sets out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland and will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>

      <P>On the advice of the Government, the individual concerned was retired, by the President, with effect from a date in June, 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 and paragraph 18(1)(f2&gt;f) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interest of the service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The individual initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 in relation to the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier. The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999. The individual appealed the case to the Supreme Court in September 1999. The Supreme Court found in favour of the State in January 2001.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of access to those documents referred to by the Deputy, I understand that a document exists in the National Archives which is the formal record of the Government decision taken on 20 June 1969 to advise the President that the individual be retired from the Defence Forces with effect from a date in June 1969 for the reason that such retirement would be in the interests of the service. This formal record of that Government decision bears the reference of an associated Department of the Taoiseach file (reference S. 17418). It would see, from previous correspondence, that the individual has already had sight of the record of this Government decision in the National Archives.</P>
      <P>I further understand that the file S. 17418 contains a memorandum from the Minister for Defence dated 19 June 1969 in relation to a matter of the individual's retirement. This memorandum originated in the Department of Defence. It is not the practice to release such documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision to retire an officer &lsquo;in the interest of the service' is only taken for the most compelling reasons. Given that the Government decision and advice to the President concerned military secur<Col N="326" /> ity, I am not in a position to comment in further detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 83 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999, urgent action was taken by my Department in relation to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. In this regard I put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The sixth meeting of a working group charged with overseeing the process is scheduled for Thursday 24 May 2001, in the Department of Defence, involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces and the flight safety officer of the Air Corps, as well a representative from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. In this regard, I am pleased considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the recommendations. This group will continue to meet on a regular basis to ensure the speedy implementation of all the safety recommendations set out in the report.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations relates to the commissioning of an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps. Intercontinental Aviation Safety Consultants, who were awarded the contract for this audit on 21 February 2001, commenced their work on 21 March 2001 and concluded the audit on 29 March 2001. I expect to receive their report before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further key recommendation in the air accident investigation unit report was the establishment of an air safety office in the Air Corps and this was acted on straight away. The air safety office has been in operation for some months past and will be an intrinsic part of the new Air Corps organisational structure upon its formal implementation. Arising from the special study on the Air Corps undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants, and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, Air Corps management has submitted a draft implementation plan to me and I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organis<Col N="327" /> ation. This will be put in place once consultations with the representative associations, which are at an advanced stage, are completed. A full time flight safety officer of lieutenant colonel rank and an officer of captain rank have been appointed by the GOC Air Corps in the interim. The flight safety officer reports directly to the GOC Air Corps. A programme of specialist training and courses to equip the flight safety officer for his post has been under way since the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the House, I take all safety issues very seriously and the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, at home and overseas, is of paramount importance. I have emphasised to the military authorities that safety standards in equipment, facilities and procedures are of the utmost importance. Funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment and procedures where necessary.</P>

      <P>My overall objective as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces it needs and that the Defence Forces continue to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve. That is the overall objective of the White Paper and I assure the House that implementation is moving ahead quickly and positively.</P>
      <P>The Chief of Staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. That plan will help us to achieve the following broad goals:</P>
      <P>to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present; and, to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
      <P>My intention is to have the plan finalised and implemented by end-2001, in accordance with the Government decision.</P>
      <P>It is important that we put the new organisation in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the prep<Col N="328" /> aration of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The Chief of Staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Arising from the special study on the Air Corps undertaken by Price Waterhouse Consultants, and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, Air Corps management has submitted a draft implementation plan to me and I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will be put in place following the completion of consultations with the representative associations which are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Air Corps, the Naval Service prepared a detailed implementation plan which I have approved. Implementation is proceeding, including the putting in place of the new organisation provided for in the plan.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported in 1999. I am pleased that the various recommendations in the report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the future development of the Reserve can be built.</P>
    <P>Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. To facilitate this, I published the report of the steering group last year and launched a consultative process to seek the views of members of the Reserve in advance of the drawing up of an implementation plan.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the new structural and organisational changes for the Reserve will require about six years to bring to completion.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased last year to announce an unprecedented additional £250 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure. This will be funded from payroll savings and from the sales of property surplus to requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Service Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group, which met each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and also met on three occasions with <Col N="329" /> the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, reported in September 1999. A thorough, comprehensive and in-depth study of the Reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by a military board, established by the then chief of staff, and latterly by the steering group itself.</P>
      <P>I formally launched the steering group report in November, 2000 at a special briefing for the southern region in Thurles organised by the military authorities for serving members of the Reserve. A similar briefing for the western region took place in Athlone in December 2000. A third briefing was held in Dublin in December 2000. I am pleased the various recommendations in the steering group report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations. I am further advised that, under the aegis of this board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I am anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. I am further advised by the military authorities that it is anticipated that the board will submit its report to the chief of staff by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force, as envisaged by the steering group, will be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and organisational changes will require about six years to bring to completion. The military authorities will consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of Reserve units within each brigade area and in the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three Reserve brigades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to <Col N="330" /> retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.</P>

The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 19 April 2001. Four tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Limited from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC Scotia from Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive evaluation process has begun on the proposed helicopters. The evaluation will, of necessity, take some time to complete. It is <Col N="331" /> expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The lead in times for delivery of the helicopters differs and this is a matter that will have to be discussed with the successful tenderer. The question of the supply of a suitable helicopter for an interim period from the same company will also be the subject of negotiation in due course. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to have the helicopters delivered at the earliest possible dates, while also taking account of the intensive training requirements involved.</P>

Height requirements in the Defence Forces are necessary because it has been the experience of training units that persons of shorter stature have difficulty carrying the bulk and weight of combat order equipment.</P>

      <P>The mission of the Army Equitation School, as assigned to it on its establishment in 1926, is to advertise the Irish horse abroad through participation in international competitions. The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction through the years and through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Equitation School has in place a purchase board consisting of the officer com<Col N="336" /> manding the equitation school, an official from the Department of Defence, the second officer commanding equitation school and Colonel E.V. Campion, retired. The equitation school actively encourages all breeders and producers who feel that they have a suitable horse to contact any member of the horse purchase board or the Army Equitation School to arrange for inspection and assessment with regard to purchase or lease.</P>
    <P>The Army Equitation School currently has 46 horses, six of which are on lease. In 2000, a total of five horses were purchased for the school and a further eight young horses have been purchased to date in 2001. My Department continues to source high quality horses for the equitation school for competition at home and abroad and I intend to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses will continue to be acquired by the school this year in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. It is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. The patrol vessel, the le <i>Roisin</i>, was commissioned on 15 December 1999 and became operational immediately afterwards. A further vessel to be named le <i>Niamh</i>, which will replace the le <i>Deirdre</i>, is due for delivery and should be operational in July this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided <Col N="338" /> by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
    <P>Fishery protection activity accounts for over 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as search and rescue, aid to the civil power, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control. Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment, in 1993, of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to drug interdiction operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities. While Naval Service personnel are designated as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in practice the Naval Service operates under the direction of the joint task force where measures to combat the importation of illegal drugs are concerned. During 1999, the Naval Service was directly involved in 11 drug related operations under the auspices of the joint task force and in 16 drug related operations in 2000. From the start of 2001 to date, there have been six of these operations involving the Naval Service and the joint task force.</P>
    <P>The detention of personnel and/or the seizure of drugs or equipment, which may be made at sea or onshore as deemed appropriate, are the responsibilities of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities. I am satisfied that the Naval Service continues to play an important role in this most vital area of drug interdiction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 101, and 190 together.</P>
      <P>The ministerial air transport service &ndash; MATS &ndash; is currently operated by the Air Corps using the Gulfstream IV executive jet, acquired in 1991, as the principal aircraft backed up by the Beechcraft King Air turboprop aircraft. The Beechcraft provides only a limited MATS operation and it is also used for pilot training. Effectively it operates nationally, to the UK and, to a minor extent, to Europe.</P>
      <P>The aircraft resources required to provide a ministerial air transport service commensurate with current and projected requirements is under consideration. This is in the context of the increased level of business for Ministers and officials to Europe and further afield. The business of the European Union itself has grown by an unprecedented degree over the last decade both in the size of its market and in the depth and range of its activities. These changes have increased significantly the travel requirements of Ministers and officials.</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing requirement for the Government to maintain a very active involvement both bilaterally, and through the EU and multilateral bodies like the United Nations, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas so as to build Ireland's political and economic relations with countries from these regions. This requirement also involves substantial air travel by Ministers.</P>
      <P>The ministerial air transport service has been a major asset for successive Governments. The service has proved to be extremely flexible to meet the changing timetables of Ministers. In this regard I would like to acknowledge the major role played by the Air Corps in operating the service so effectively over the years. It is important that any action required to maintain the high standards set for the operation of the ministerial air transport service is taken. In that regard, all options which could improve the service available to the Government are being examined. No decisions have been made as yet but I expect to bring a memorandum to Government on the matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment, and re-equipment of the Defence Forces as recommended in the context of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally. It is expected that £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks. Most of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment. The Government has decided, in line with the White Paper on Defence, that a rigorous audit of the necessity for other property be undertaken and only those required for essential defence purposes will be retained. This audit is ongoing and properties identified will be disposed of by sale or otherwise. The Government has approved that the proceeds, along with the revenue from the existing programme of barrack disposals, will be invested in the Defence Forces infrastructure and equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 118, and 180 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify any confusion arising from the description of the capabilities for the EU headline goal, a voluntary target which EU member states aim to meet by the year 2003, as a rapid reaction force. The response capacity currently being developed by the EU, and frequently described as a rapid reaction force, is emphatically not a standing army. Rather, it constitutes a catalogue of capabilities to be available by 2003 to provide the means to carry out Petersberg Tasks, tasks of crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor.</P>
      <P>Ireland has offered to contribute up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the headline goal from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations standby arrangements system. The largest element of the commitment involves a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel, with an Army ranger wing platoon of 40, in addition to small numbers in national support, headquarters and observer elements which make up the remainder.</P>
      <P>Participation in any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, will be considered on a case by case basis and Ireland will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>The commitments made in relation to the EU headline goal must be seen in the context of Ireland's long-standing support for overseas peace support operations authorised by the United Nations. In this regard, the White Paper on Defence, published last year, sets out key elements of the Government's approach to overseas peace support operations and I wish to refer to a number of the most important and relevant elements. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for a reshaping and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared for the opportunities and challenges of the changing security and defence environment. This strategy embraces organisation, equipment, training and technology aspects. In this context, the White Paper contains the strategy for the Defence Forces strength and organisation for the next ten years and concluded that the Permanent Defence Force requires a strength of 10,500 personnel, ready to fulfil current tasks at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the financial position generally, the White Paper acknowledged the trend for many overseas peace support missions to be <Col N="342" /> financed by the participating countries. While this may increase the overall net cost of overseas operations in a situation where the proportion of missions with a reimbursement facility declines, the general strategy for the management of the Defence Vote within existing resources will set the context for all defence programmes, including overseas operations. On military training, the White Paper recognised that the primary focus of the Defence Forces when not engaged in operations, is training and preparation. As a reflection of the evolving defence and security environment, increased emphasis will be placed on exercises stressing interoperability, procedures and doctrine.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came to office very significant progress has been achieved in investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. An unprecedented level of investment has been made since then and the investment situation continues to improve following decisions made on the White Paper on Defence. The White Paper on Defence sets out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. It involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>

      <P>Following a tender competition which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers &ndash; APCs &ndash; initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
      <P>The first two vehicles were produced at the end of 2000 and following rigorous inspection and acceptance testing procedures were officially handed over to me on 11 January 2001. Both vehicles remained in Switzerland to facilitate training of Defence Forces personnel. The full production run has commenced. A total of six vehicles, including the two vehicles handed over in January, will be arriving in Ireland next month. All 40 APCs will have been delivered by January 2002, almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>

      <P>The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. The strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 March 2001 was 10,625. In the year 2001 to date a total of 201 general service recruits have been enlisted in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required. I launched the Defence Forces 2001 general service recruiting campaign in March 2001 which was followed by national and local media advertising. Careers in the Defence Forces are promoted throughout the country with activities such as military displays, visits to schools to promote careers in the Defence Forces, the distribution of information leaflets and booklets to schools and FÁS offices. These activities will be ongoing in 2001. The cost of the 2001 recruitment campaign to date is £63,000 approximately. All the general service recruitment, apprenticeship and cadetship competitions are open to school leavers. No statistical data is available in relation to the numbers of long-term unemployed recruited to the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>On 28 March 2001 I visited Kosovo where I met with Irish troops serving with the fourth Irish contingent &ndash; transport company &ndash; KFOR. KFOR was established under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 on 10 June 1999, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The resolution, among other things, authorised the establishment and deployment of an international security presence in Kosovo with all necessary means to fulfil its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I was accompanied on my visit to Kosovo by the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff. The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of the Irish military personnel serving in the region and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service. I saw again how the hearts of Irish soldiers are touched by the humanitarian catastrophe which is prevalent in Kosovo. Since the Irish troops set up Camp Clarke in Pristina they have raised funds to rebuild the homes of several families. I am delighted to have been in a position to make a grant of £10,000 towards such suitable projects. I regard Irish participation in KFOR as an important and practical expression of our ongoing commitment to peacekeeping in general and to the cause of peace and stability in Kosovo. Furthermore, it responds to the foreign policy priority of staying in the mainstream of peacekeeping at a time when the UN is increasingly turning to regional solutions for peacekeeping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 116 and 196 to 198 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In the White Paper on Defence the Government decided the Defence Forces require a strength of 10,500 personnel, ready to fulfil current tasks at home and abroad. Having regard to the defence and security environment, the Government's policy for defence is aimed at ensuring that the following requirements are met: to maintain a military force structure that provides a basis for responding to any major change in Ireland's strategic circumstances in the medium to long term, as well as demonstrating an appropriate commitment to national defence; to maintain a military force structure capable of responding to requests to provide aid to the civil power and in that context, contributing to the prevention of security challenges from abroad including terrorism and arms smuggling; to fulfil Ireland's international and regional responsibilities arising from membership of the UN by providing a range of military capabilities that can effectively be employed to participate in a broad range of multinational peace support and humanitarian relief operations. Ireland has committed a maximum of 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under the United Nations standby arrangements system &ndash; UNSAS; and to demonstrate Ireland's commitment to European security by having a suitable range of military capabilities that can be used to make appropriate contributions to regional security missions authorised by the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's approach to participation in Partnership for Peace &ndash; PfP &ndash; was set out in the presentation document of 1 December 1999, which was approved by this House. The presentation document included the five priority areas of cooper<Col N="346" /> ation on international peacekeeping, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, cooperation in the protection of the environment and cooperation in marine matters.</P>
    <P>Ireland's objectives for participation in PfP include: to promote the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to foster democratic control of armed forces internationally; to contribute to development of best practice in the areas of international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations; to enhance the capabilities of military officers, civil servants and diplomats engaged in the shaping and executing of security and defence policies; to enhance the capabilities, including the area of interoperability, of Ireland's Defence Forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates; to enhance the capabilities of Ireland's Defence Forces, Civil Defence and other relevant organisations to contribute to the areas of civil emergency planning; and to share information and expertise particularly in the area of international peacekeeping, arms control, civil emergency planning, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, scientific and environmental issues.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities. Following on from joining PfP, an individual partnership programme &ndash; IPP &ndash; for Ireland's participation was developed. This is Ireland's first IPP and therefore provides an initial presentation of Ireland's broad approach and planned activities. Ireland's policy approach will be developed in the light of initial experience and the IPP has been drawn up in a flexible form to allow for adjustment in the light of ongoing experience.</P>
    <P>Details of the planned activities, which allow for adjustment based on policy development and the availability of financial and other resources, have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. The activities chosen are, in the main, training courses, seminars and table top exercises and will involve participation at officer and non-commissioned officer level.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that the State will not seek to commit Air Corps equipment resources to an overseas operation. In a situation where there are many demands on resources it would not be reasonable to participate beyond the domestic context. Similarly, in relation to the Naval Service the Government has decided that the emphasis will be on utilisation and development of the Naval Service to contribute to the maximum to all of the State's requirements in the maritime domain and to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. Fishery protection activities account for over 90% of Naval Service operations.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, as a result of recent public concern regarding possible environmental and health risks relating to the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Balkans, the Defence Forces have put in place a medical screening programme for all Irish troops who have served or are serving in the Balkan region as well as personnel who served as military observers in Kuwait following the Gulf War. All personnel, including those who have retired, are being called to the various brigade centres to undergo the screening. This process is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The screening programme commenced in January 2001. This medical screening programme has been put in place to provide reassurance for personnel and their families and includes blood and urine tests with a clinical examination.</P>
      <P>Taking all the relevant missions into account the total number to be screened is 952, including two officials of my Department who served in the Balkan region. To date a total of 325 &ndash; 322 serving and three former &ndash; Defence Forces personnel have received screening. No unusual medical problems have been detected.</P>

The estimated additional costs incurred as a result of Defence Forces involvement in the foot and mouth disease operation, exclusive of allowances, amounts to £233,000. The overall estimated cost of allowances to date is £520,000. The number of Defence Forces personnel involved in the entire operation was reduced from 250 personnel to 160 personnel on 19 April 2001. This was due to the scaling down of the Cooley Peninsula operation where the Defence Forces operated 34 checkpoints, seven mobile patrols and assisted in the culling of wildlife. The Defence Forces continue to operate 104 checkpoints on the Border with Northern Ireland and are providing a monitoring service at Dublin port.</P>

The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations, one of which was that the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps GASU pilots. This recommendation was implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing GASU operation, I announced, in February 2000, that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the GASU. Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on <Col N="351" /> 22 May 2000, a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence issued. The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued only to Eurocopter through its Irish agent, Atron based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. However, Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which it could guarantee and support.</P>
    <P>Discussions took place with the military authorities and the Air Corps and it was decided to attempt to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter. The tender documentation was prepared and on 27 September 2000 a request for tender for the supply of one used AS 355N helicopter to the Department of Defence issued to a total of 15 companies. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 October 2000. The result of the tender competition indicated that there were very few AS 355N helicopters available on the open market. Only six responses were received some of which offered different helicopter types which could not be considered. Essentially, the valid tenders from three companies related to the same, one only, AS 355N helicopter which was available in the Philippines. Having considered the responses and the various factors involved, the option to look further into the possible purchase of this particular helicopter was not taken up by the Department.</P>
    <P>All options for the provision of night flying training of Air Corps pilots for the GASU are under active consideration in my Department but the prospect of obtaining a second-hand Squirrel helicopter for this work are not good given our experience in the tender competitions and the buoyancy of the market for such helicopters. This matter is the subject of on-going discussion between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>At the invitation of the Swedish Minister for Defence I attended an informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers in Brussels on 6 April 2001. The meeting, an informal event, was not a decision making forum. Matters discussed centred on European security and defence policy &ndash; ESDP &ndash; in general and in particular on progress made to date on making the EU crisis management capability <Col N="352" /> operational in order to fulfil the Helsinki headline goal by 2003.</P>
      <P>Other issues discussed included: the development of a capabilities review mechanism which will allow full transparency and coherence between the EU and NATO processes, while at the same time ensuring the EU's autonomous decision making; the ongoing involvement of non-EU European NATO members as well as countries that are candidates for accession to the EU in the development of European crisis management capabilities and continued dialogue with Russia on the evolving European security architecture so as to benefit from the constructive Russian attitude to ESDP. In this regard the Swedish Presidency is to arrange an<i> ad hoc</i> meeting with the Russian Defence Minister to facilitate an informal exchange of views early this summer.</P>

      <P>In recent years the selection process for the award of cadetships in the Permanent Defence Force has involved psychometric testing which includes both written and verbal psychological assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the high failure rate of trainee pilots psychometric testing was first introduced in the selection process for Air Corps cadets in 1990. Its introduction reduced considerably the failure rate of trainee pilots and was regarded as a success. It was subsequently introduced as part of <Col N="353" /> the selection process for Naval Service and Army cadets.</P>
    <P>Research shows that psychometric testing can accurately predict future performance and represents a best practice approach to the selection process for cadetships.</P>

    <P>During builders sea trials, which take place in <Col N="354" /> advance of customer acceptance sea trials, a problem arose with the port gearbox on the ship. This is being addressed by Appledore Shipbuilders Limited with the manufacturer of the gearbox. When the gearbox is replaced, the ship will undergo customer acceptance sea trials which will be attended by representatives of the Department of Defence and the Naval Service. When these trials are complete, and everything going well, the ship will be officially handed over to the Department. The hand-over is expected to take place by the end of June 2001. It is expected that the ship will commence operational duties in July 2001. The ship will be fitted with an Oto Melara 76 millimetre gun following the arrival of the vessel in Ireland.</P>

The unit commander has the responsibility for the allocation and maintenance of each firing range. In each brigade, senior staff officers are appointed to maintain engineering and communication facilities on the firing ranges. I am further advised by the military authorities that the nominated unit commander in charge of a range must publish range orders to include safety policy, warning signs, warning flags and safety flags. In addition, all orders must include medical cover required for each activity and a security plan.</P>
      <P>Safety procedures must be rigorously checked by the officer in charge of range practices before any firing commences and most ranges have a maintenance staff who are tasked with ensuring that safety policy is implemented in addition to range maintenance.

      <P>This question refers to the issue of having military service allowance &ndash; MSA &ndash; included in the calculation of pensions of Defence Forces personnel who retired before the 1 August 1990. As I previously indicated to the House, the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the MSA, and the consequences for pensioners generally was specifically addressed by the Commission on Public Service Pensions in its final report, which was published by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on 31 January 2001. The Government has not yet completed its detailed consideration of the commission's report. Once it has done so, the Government will make formal decisions on the commission's recommendations. In this context, the report is a lengthy and complex document and contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations regarding public service pensions generally.</P>
      <P>When publishing the report, the Minister for Finance noted, in particular, the commission's view that its recommendations as set out in its final report represent an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the package of measures as a whole. As I recently indicated to the House, this element will be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>

      <P>An increase in the grant payable to managing agents on the job initiative programme &ndash; JI &ndash; has been sanctioned. The grant will increase from £220 to £238 per participant, per week, and will be backdated to 1 April 2001. Managing agents may retain up to 12% of the FÁS grant towards training and development of the participants, administration costs and overheads of the project. The grant increase will, therefore, provide for a new minimum payment to JI participants of £209.43, representing an increase of £15.83 per week on the previous minimum payment. There were 2,736 participants on JI at the end of April 2001.</P>

      <P>Community employment is an active labour market programme whose primary role is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. The general terms and conditions relating to participation on CE have been reviewed and adjusted in the light of both the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure this programme, and the recommendations contained in the subsequent P2000 report on facilitating women's access to labour market opportunities. I have no plans in the short-term to further amend the criteria pertaining to participation on the community employment scheme.</P>

    <P>The transfer of responsibility for the administration of employment services for people with disabilities to FÁS in June 2000 has opened up a wider range of options for people with disabilities. The supported employment programme, which I launched last year, is particularly beneficial to people who have previously had difficulty in engaging in open employment. The programme provides on-the-job supports to people with disabilities, through the use of job coaches, to assist their integration into employment.

      <P>Insurance price movements are normally based on underwriting experience as well as trends in the level, frequency and cost, past and potential, of claims and are a matter for judgment by individual private insurance companies. Decisions on the risks that the companies are prepared to underwrite are also a matter for the companies themselves.</P>
      <P>Under EU law, our Department is prohibited from having any function in relation to either prior approval or prior notification of price changes nor can our Department intervene in particular underwriting decisions by insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing insurance premiums must be on reducing the <Col N="361" /> frequency of accidents and the associated costs of settling the consequent claims.</P>
    <P>There has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of insurance premiums in the area of public liability. A Deloitte &amp; Touche report on insurance costs in this country found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs were, again, the high-legal-costs component of small claim settlements, the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards, relative to special damages, in smaller claims.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board will be reporting to me later this year, after which I will take whatever further action is appropriate towards the goal of reducing the cost of motor insurance. Furthermore, the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board by 2002 will address the issue of the high delivery cost of compensation.</P>

      <P>All Enterprise Ireland facilities are available to its client companies, including both the knitwear and textile sectors in County Donegal. Specific supports are dependent on client needs and are becoming more focused on training and management building within companies.</P>
      <P>During the past 18 months, Enterprise Ireland has offered/approved a wide range of supports to companies in County Donegal that operate within the knitwear and textile industry. These included employment grants, capital grants, training and human resource development, feasibility studies to investigate new product development, strategic consultancy and fair trade participation support.</P>
      <P>In addition to financial assistance, Enterprise Ireland offers a wide range of market development supports to the clothing, knitwear and textile sector, with dedicated teams working in the agency's overseas offices.</P>
      <P>A training programme entitled &ldquo;Marketing for Profitable Growth&rdquo; started recently, with representation from the clothing and textile industry. All Enterprise Ireland client companies were invited to participate.</P>
      <P>A PR campaign for the clothing and textile industry called &ldquo;Take a Closer Look&rdquo; is currently being managed by a PR company and this campaign has generated significant exposure for the industry. This is a partnership approach to the sector, including Donegal County Enterprise Board and Udarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> With regard to the stability of the companies operating in County Donegal, the majority of Enterprise Ireland companies have found a balance between producing high-quality niche products in small volumes in Ireland and outsourcing their large-volume orders from lower-cost countries.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the recently published OECD report on regulatory reform, which comments on the many positive aspects of Ireland's regulatory regime. The report also highlights areas where progress must be made in eliminating entry restrictions to sectors of economic activity, including the pharmacy sector. Consequently, the Government has promised that a review of the health (community pharmacy contractor agreement) regulations will be accelerated.</P>

      <P>Ireland is the nerve centre of the company's Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) operations and is the key to the company's development in the region. Over the past ten years, the company has continued to invest in Ireland and now has five facilities, with a combined workforce of 5,700 people at locations in Limerick, Bray and Cherrywood, Loughlinstown. The company has a long-established track record in Ireland and is proud of the contribution it has made and continues to make to the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its standard business practice, the company is continuing to review its operations here and throughout the world on a regular basis. It is cautious about forward statements or predictions, particularly in the current market climate. <Col N="363" /> In common with other computer companies, the company has been affected by the current downturn in the US, and its chairman has described the environment for the company as challenging.</P>
    <P>However, the company remains committed to its successful operations in Ireland and has, to date, met all of its commitments in terms of job numbers. Limerick is one of its most cost-efficient and productive manufacturing facilities worldwide. The company's goal is to ensure that this continues.</P>
    <P>The company's strategy is to build on the successes of its business to date by continuing to take the market share in a slower market. That focus has recently made it number one worldwide. It will continue to focus on price aggression and cost efficiencies. The company believes it can achieve these goals and will always endeavour to be a quality employer in Ireland.</P>

      <Quest> if there are proposals under the restructuring of IDA Ireland to locate an IDA Ireland administrative centre in Ballinasloe, County Galway in view of the impact of serious job losses in the town and the failure to attract IDA-supported jobs in the town for the past 25 years; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>IDA Ireland currently has no plans to locate an administrative centre in Ballinasloe, County Galway, under the restructuring proposals of the agency.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are structured on a regional basis so as to ensure that this is achieved. Over the last 18 months, IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the objective of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into Objective One regions in the coming years. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions. In 2000, IDA Ireland achieved this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Ballinasloe, I established the Ballinasloe Inter-Agency Group in February 2000 in response to the announcement by AT Cross of job losses at the company. In my announcement of establishment of that group, I asked IDA Ireland to treat Ballinasloe as a priority location for overseas investment. I also requested the chairman of the group to liaise with the public and private sectors and the community bodies who can assist in promoting the area for investment and job creation. I am informed that work is now under way for the production of a new industrial brochure for the town under the aegis of the group. Work is also being undertaken on the development of a skills profile and training <Col N="364" /> requirements for the AT Cross workforce by FÁS and SIPTU.</P>
    <P>In addition to this activity, IDA Ireland acquired 35 acres of land at Creagh on the east side of Ballinasloe in 1999 for the development of a new high specification business park. Phase one of the development work and all services on the site have now been completed. IDA Ireland has worked with a local group of developers who have completed a new 27,800 square feet advance unit on the new park. IDA Ireland is aggressively marketing this building and the business park to overseas clients.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's efforts to secure inward investment for Ballinasloe have resulted in Valois, a French engineering company, establishing a manufacturing operation in the town. The company is commencing operations in a temporary facility while it is working with its property advisers to design and develop a new customised facility. The company will employ 60 people at full production and recruitment is currently under way.</P>

      <P>The closure of the ESB power station at Ferbane is not a matter for which I, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, have responsibility.</P>
      <P>With regard to the creation of jobs in the area, the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department are continuing to promote County Offaly and the midlands as locations for mobile investment and indigenous industrial development.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development, which has responsibility for developing indigenous industry in south Offaly, has reported an increase of 5% in employment in the area in 2000. In Ferbane, Shannon Development is co-funding a development plan in conjunction with the local community and Offaly County Council. This steering group has met on a number of occasions and a consultant has been appointed. Work has commenced. Shannon Development is represented on the steering group by its regional development executive in Birr.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development has also recently grant assisted a local start-up company, Glass Innovations Limited, in respect of a new production facility to provide specialist finishes for the glass industry. It is expected that the plant will soon be operational and will employ 11 people at full production. Shannon Development is also negotiating the sale of a site in Ferbane to a local small business which will construct a new facility as part of an expansion proposal.</P>

In the past 18 months, IDA Ireland has succeeded in attracting the following companies to County Offaly &ndash; Sanirish, Edenderry, with a total of 35 jobs; Continental AG, Tullamore, with a total of 110 jobs; Flextronics, Tullamore, with a total of 349 jobs, and Grafica Zannini, Tullamore, with in excess of 21 jobs.</P>

Infrastructural enhancement and a modernisation programme for Dunmore East fishery harbour will be considered within the context of the national development plan. The plan, which covers the period 2000 to 2006, provides for a spend of £60 million, 76.19 million, on the development of fishery harbours and related facilities.</P>

      <Quest>the position on a trial that was to be taken in relation to a safety device (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a previous Parliamentary Question on 6 February 2001 in which I explained that there is no mechanism by which my Department can test the submerged vessel locator buoy designed by Mr. Kelly.</P>
      <P>However, as I indicated in my reply, I was anxious that its potential usefulness as a safety device should receive the fullest consideration. To this end, I directed that the submerged vessel locator buoy be brought to the attention of the Fishing Vessel Safety Implementation Group to advise me on whether the carriage of such a locator buoy would merit consideration as a statutory requirement. The implementation group comprises representatives of the relevant divisions within the Department, including the Coast Guard and Marine Survey Office, BIM and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1999, all fishing vessels are required to carry two distress emitting systems, an emergency position indicating radio beacon &ndash; EPIRB &ndash; and a global maritime distress and safety system &ndash; GMDSS &ndash; which are both capable of providing accurate vessel position information when activated. An EPIRB signal is usually picked up within an hour. It will give an initial location of the vessel, and even if the EPIRB drifts away from the sunken vessel, its location will already have been transmitted to the search and rescue authorities. The submerged vessel locator buoy would require a separate EPIRB to be attached to it to enable it to be an effective means of locating a sunken vessel. However, this EPIRB could not be used as the primary EPIRB as it is possible that it could fail to break free for mechanical or other reasons and the alarm would not be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, regarding the mandatory carriage of an EPIRB and GMDSS, the implementation group concluded that the submerged vessel locator buoy would not have any additional safety <Col N="369" /> value for fishing vessels to merit its consideration as a statutory requirement.</P>
    <P>The views of the fishing industry were also requested and these are awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals concerning the development of the three State airports, including Dublin Airport, are in the first instance a matter for Aer Rianta, which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> Dublin Airport is the country's main airport serving the needs not just of the travelling public in the capital city and the surrounding counties, but of the country's tourism, business and freight sectors generally. Notwithstanding the greatly welcome increase in traffic at Shannon and Cork airports and, to a lesser extent, the regional airports, Dublin airport will remain crucial to the national economy. Apart from being the country's main access point by air, Dublin Airport has been, and still is, highly significant in terms of the local economy of the north side of Dublin and provides substantial and valuable employment for the people of the surrounding areas, both directly and indirectly through the multitude of service industries that have evolved over time in and around the facility. This is also true of the other two State airports at Shannon and Cork.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is currently engaged in a review of its long-term master plan for Dublin Airport. That review is being carried out in consultation with the stakeholders, including airlines and other business customers and local residents. The plan will determine the key requirements in terms of future development of infrastructural facilities to ensure that the airport has sufficient capacity to meet future demand. In this regard, Dublin Airport has considerable scope and capacity to expand further to cater for future growth in air traffic.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion for a study to identify an alternative site for a second airport to serve the Dublin region, I would remind the <Col N="373" /> Deputy that this issue was addressed in the consultants' report I commissioned from Warburg Dillon Read into the future strategy for Aer Rianta. The consultants confirmed that Dublin does not need a second airport, given Dublin Airport's capacity to grow for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>While the process of stakeholder consultation is not yet complete, I understand that it is Aer Rianta's strong view that the proposed second runway must continue to form an integral part of the long-term master plan for Dublin Airport. Because of passenger growth projections, Aer Rianta estimates that this runway will need to be in place before the end of the current decade.</P>
    <P>The proposal to provide the second parallel runway is far from new. Aer Rianta began acquiring the necessary lands involved in the late 1960s and, as far back as 1972, the then county council included the runway in the county development plan.</P>
    <P>The proposal to proceed with the runway project will, of course, be subject to planning permission being obtained. The planning process will provide the appropriate forum for all interested parties, including local residents, to have their views and any concerns heard by the planning authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand that Aer Rianta has appointed an environmental impact consultant and work has begun on assessing the environmental implications of the proposed new runway.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 163, 164 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, lays an overall duty on the Commission for Electricity Regulation, in carrying out its duties, to have regard to the need to promote the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. The Act also gives the commission the power to direct and approve the preparation of a rolling annual forecast of generating capacity for the information of the industry. A forecast of this nature entitled Generation Adequacy Statement was published by Eirgrid on 7 May 2001 for the period 2001 to 2007.</P>
      <P>The provision of electricity to large users, currently using above 4 GWH per annum, is a liberalised activity and a matter for market players including ESB. At the operational level, the actual provision of electricity supply to individual customers is a day-to-day matter for ESB and Eirgrid and not one in which I have a function.</P>

      <P>The report recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, a full deregulation of the CHP market. I have done this through section 9(<i>a</i>)(ii) of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>The report has been circulated to all the relevant Government Departments and the Commission for Electricity Regulation and has been published on my Department's website, www.dpe.ie.

      <P>The mobile phone market in Ireland is continuing to develop in terms of competition and service. The third mobile network operator commenced operations earlier this year and further licences for third-generation mobile services will be offered this year. There are substantial opportunities for technological and service innovation in this market and operators are offering a range of new features and services. Further developments offering facilities such as e-commerce are in the pipeline.</P>
      <P>According to a report by the ODTR last March, there were approximately 2.4 million mobile phone users in Ireland in the first quarter of this year, representing 67% of the population.</P>
      <P>The introduction of further competition in the Irish market is expected to result in lower retail tariffs for mobile telephony. There has been comment, not only in Ireland, but generally in Europe, on the charges for international roaming, and the European Commission has carried out an investigation of roaming charges in Europe.</P>
      <P>A key issue relating to the further development of competition and services in the mobile sector is the scope of regulatory intervention in the market. The situation of the mobile sector is an issue in the current proposals for reform of the regulatory framework in Europe. Negotiations on five new draft directives are in progress within the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, with a view to their adoption later this year.</P>

      <P>At 3 a.m. on 26 February 2001, a civilian car drove through the checkpoint at the Border crossing at Frevagh Bridge, County Leitrim, from the northern side of the Border. It drove around the village of Kiltyclogher, County Leitrim, and exited to the north at the Border crossing to the east of the village.</P>
      <P>At various hours during the night of 7 March 2001, civilian cars approached the checkpoint at the Border crossing at Munnilly Bridge, County Monaghan. The occupants shouted abuse and behaved in a belligerent manner. The Garda has indicated that both incidents were hooligan related and that it is pursuing the matter with the Northern authorities.</P>
      <P>The foot and mouth disease operation is an aid to the civil authority operation, with assistance being provided by the Defence Forces as a result of a request from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Defence Forces personnel engaged in this operation are authorised officers for the purposes of section 17A(2) of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, as amended by the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001.

In addition, an information desk staffed by officials from the civilian employee section of my Department was provided in the barracks to answer questions on the various options available to civilian employees at the barracks. These options include relocation to the Curragh with existing work; redeployment to other Dublin units; and voluntary early retirement. Over 50% of the staff availed of this facility and were given specific information relevant to their own personal circumstances. I will be pleased to re-open the information desk if staff representatives within the barracks feel there is a need to do so. Alternatively, any staff member can contact my Department's civilian employee section directly where the specific options open to him or her can be discussed and explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the submission of the White Paper on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000, the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force to 10,500, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence set out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. It involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
      <P>Substantial programmes of investment will take place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and some examples are as follows.</P>
      <P>The first two of the new fleet of 40 armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing in total £40 million, were produced at the end of 2000 and officially handed over to the Department of Defence on 11 January 2001. All 40 vehicles will be delivered by January of next year, almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
      <P>There has been significant investment in recent years on new vehicles for the Army with over £6.5 million spent on specialist transport cargo vehicles, deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4s, and three quarter ton trucks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over £10.5 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. An investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million over the next three years is under way. The package includes <Col N="382" /> the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces has commenced.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The building of the second new ship for the Naval Service which is similar to L.E. <i>Róisín</i> is almost complete. As with L.E. <i>Róisín</i>, the new ship will also cost over £20 million. The ship, which will be named L.E. <i>Niamh</i>, is expected to enter operational service in July 2001.</P>
    <P>The new equipment programme is a top priority for me. It ensures that the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation in which people are proud to serve. The Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will have the most modern of equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>

      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group, which met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and also met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, reported in September 1999. A thorough, comprehensive and in-depth study of the Reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by a military board, established by the then Chief of Staff, and latterly by the steering group.</P>
      <P>I formally launched the steering group report in November 2000 at a special briefing for the southern region in Thurles organised by the military authorities for serving members of the Reserve. A similar briefing for the western region took place in Athlone in December 2000. A third briefing was held in Dublin in December 2000. I am pleased that the various recommendations contained in the steering group report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations. These plans will include training, infrastructure, equipment, operations and finance. I am further advised that, under the aegis of this military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. I am further advised by the military authorities that it is anticipated that the board will submit its report to the Chief of Staff by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Use of antibiotics as growth promoters in the EU is regulated under Council Directive 70-524. Under this legislation, four specific antibiotics continue to be approved for growth promotion purposes within the EU. This follows the ban, with effect from the beginning of 2000, on four other antibiotics on the basis of the precautionary principle in order to avoid any possible contribution to the development of antibiotic resistance.</P>
      <P>Third countries are obliged under relevant EU legislation to provide guarantees in a specified format to the European Commission, <i>inter alia,</i> to the effect that they have systems in place to ensure that product exported to the EU does not contain levels of antibiotic residues levels in excess of the relevant maximum residue limits, MRLs. In addition, third countries are subjected to verification missions by inspectors from the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, which missions, I understand, include examination of their measures to control use of antibiotics for growth promotion purposes.</P>

      <P>Under EU legislation, third countries wishing to export poultry products to the EU must satisfy the European Commission that their legislative frameworks and control regimes offer equivalent guarantees to those in place in the EU. In particular, third countries must furnish to the Commission on an annual basis detailed residue monitoring plans, together with results of testing under such programmes. The Commission also carries out inspection missions in third countries to verify implementation of control measures. Where the Commission is not satisfied with the regime in place in a third country, its authorisation to export to the EU may be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Imports of poultrymeat have become a significant feature of the industry and I understand price attractiveness is an important consideration. My preference would be that the industry should use native raw material to the greatest degree possible but it is the case that a considerable quantity of these imports are processed into finished meal products and re-exported.</P>
      <P>The Irish poultry industry is expected to expand production and demand is forecast to increase also.</P>
      <P>The main conditions for imports into Ireland are: advance notification to my Department of consignments; the goods must be accompanied by veterinary certification or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an approved establishment, for example, slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold-store which has been approved by the European Commission; the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>Imports of poultry meat products are selected for sampling on a regular basis to monitor the health status of the product. Under arrangements agreed between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and my Department, 1,200 samples of imported poultrymeat are being tested to check for the presence of illegal residues. It must be borne in mind, however, that particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU. Goods detected as not being in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary destroyed.</P>

The independent consultant contracted to assess all the business plans submitted is concluding the work and will make recommendations which will be taken into account by my Department's selection committee. It is expected that the selection committee will arrive at its conclusions within a short timeframe, having regard to the terms of the Commission's formal approval when received. I will then make a report to Government and the formal appointment of the appropriate number of groups will be decided by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending this, I have to date allocated £4.8 million by way of interim funding to existing groups without prejudice as to which groups will be appointed to deliver the forthcoming Leader programmes. The interim funding will help groups maintain a core resource of expertise in order <Col N="390" /> that proposals for sustainable projects can be put in train promptly by the groups appointed to deliver the two new programmes.</P>

      <P>That REPS application was chosen for a full plan and on-farm inspection.

After several written reminders, the documentation in question was received on 21 March 2001 at my Department's REPS headquarters in Wexford.</P>
      <P>On 29 March the file was referred to the regional inspector for examination, as there is an issue of eligibility for the scheme.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>I have, in recent weeks, made a number of adjustments to the foot and mouth disease controls, based on recommendations from the expert group and subject to strict protocols being adhered to. For example, recent adjustments have been made to allow the movement of stock bulls, to allow the movement of cattle from feedlots, and between fragments of the same holding and, most recently, to allow farm to farm cattle sales. Marts may also be used for the assembly of cattle, sheep and pigs going direct for slaughter.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these measures will go some way towards relieving the pressure on many farmers. There are no funds available to me to provide compensation for farmers affected by these controls but qualifying farm families may avail of the farm assist scheme.</P>
      <P>As for the general resumption of mart operations, the expert group has not, for the present, made any recommendations in this regard and while I am conscious of the pressures on farmers, I am equally conscious that a further outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country would have far more serious consequences for the farming community and for the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason I do not intend to relax controls indiscriminately. However, I will take appropriate measures in relation to the phased resumption of marts when the expert group, on the basis of a <Col N="395" /> risk assessment, makes recommendations in this regard.</P>

      <P>
        <b>(Mr. Walsh):</b> I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 and 237 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the procedures to monitor traceability of cattle presented for slaughter in abattoirs, whether they are large scale export approved premises or smaller domestic abattoirs, are sufficient to ensure the safety of the beef derived from those cattle. All cattle presented for slaughter must be checked against my Department's cattle movement and monitoring system &ndash; CMMS &ndash; to verify the origin, identity and life history of the animal against the database before the animal proceeds for slaughter. In relation to export approved plants, which are controlled by veterinary officials of my Department, verification of the animal details against the central database is carried out on-line between export factories and the central database. Domestic <Col N="398" /> abattoirs, which are licensed by my Department but are under the day-to-day operational control of the relevant local authority on behalf of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, are not linked on-line to the central mainframe because of their small size and low throughput. In these cases, the CMMS clearance checks are conducted by the district veterinary offices of my Department based on written notifications of intention to slaughter sent by fax by the abattoirs.</P>
    <P>Developments following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK highlighted the necessity for improved traceability procedures in relation to sheep to be implemented. A new sheep identification system has now been set up and arrangements are being made to have it in operation by early June.</P>
    <P>All animals presented for slaughter at export approved or domestic abattoirs are subject to <i>ante mortem</i> and<i> post mortem</i> inspection by veterinary officials of my Department or local authority veterinary officials in the case of the latter to establish the welfare and health status of the animals and their fitness for slaughter for human consumption. Animals must pass all <i>ante mortem</i> and<i> post</i><i>mortem</i> inspections before they can enter the food chain.</P>

My Department will reschedule the courses as soon as it is considered practicable and safe, in terms of FMD precautions, to do so. Applicants will be informed directly of the dates.</P>

      <QRef>[13900/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): All area aid applications are processed by reference to herd numbers. When lodged in the Department area aid applications are first scanned on to a document retrieval system and they are then data captured and registered. When farmers lodge an area aid application for the first time it is necessary for control purposes that the applicant's holding be inspected prior to issuing a new herdnumber. It takes some time for all inspections to be completed.</P>
    <P>This year as an emergency measure it has been necessary for my Department to redeploy staff to foot and mouth duties and as a consequence it is difficult to state precisely when inspections will be completed. Nevertheless, I will keep the matter under continuous review so that herdnumbers can be issued as quickly as possible. It is also my intention to ensure that all payments, except where there are problems, are made on time in accordance with the protocol on direct payments to farmers.</P>

      <P>The first phase of the fallen animal collection scheme was put in place on 1 December 2000 when the gate fee was removed for fallen animal material being delivered to dedicated rendering plants by licensed fallen animal collectors. As part of this, the State accepted responsibility for the rendering and destruction of the resultant material. The cost of collection and transport of these animals to the dedicated rendering plant must be met by the collector and is charged commercially to the farmer.</P>

    <P>As I have previously stated, the second phase of the scheme involving the application of a subsidy towards on-farm collection charges is currently under negotiation. Discussions have been <Col N="400" /> held with the various interest groups and I am hopeful that this element of the scheme can be implemented at an early date.</P>

      <P>Section 668 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provided for profit deferral for tax purposes and 100% stock relief on the compulsory disposal of cattle due to statutory disease eradication measures. This was amended by section 49 of the Finance Act, 2001, which extended the provisions to include all animals and poultry that are specified in Part 1 and Part 2 of the Schedule to the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.</P>
      <P>The amendment was specifically included to allow for circumstances where a farmer's livestock is affected by the foot and mouth disease. It applies where a farmer disposes of any such animals on or after 6 December 2000 as a result of which compensation is paid to him or her by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh. Where a farmer elects for treatment under section 668, the profits arising from the disposal are excluded from the profits of the accounting period in which the disposal took place and are included in equal instalments either in the profits of the two accounting periods subsequent to the period in which the disposal took place or, at the option of the farmer, in the accounting period in which the disposal actually took place and in the following accounting period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the farmer is entitled to 100% stock relief in the two year deferral period. Since these arrangements have been in place heretofore <Col N="404" /> for other disease eradication programmes and have been sufficient to meet the requirements, I have no immediate plans to make any additional amendments at this time. However, I will review the operation of these arrangements in the context of the next budget and Finance Bill in the light of developments over the coming months in this area.</P>

      <P>Section 658 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for allowances in respect of capital expenditure on farm buildings and other works to be written off over a seven year period. I have no plans to alter this scheme of allowances in respect of expenditure in County Louth or elsewhere due to the obvious difficulties in creating a tiered system of allowances based on geographical area. Further difficulties in introducing such a scheme would also be likely to arise within the context of the European Commission's state aid rules.</P>

The Government will then move to establish the working group, provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to advise on implementation of the relevant Government decisions. The working group will comprise representatives of the public service unions, relevant Government Departments and other appropriate bodies.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations have implications for all parties having an interest in public service pensions including the Government, public service employers, trade unions, pensioner associations such as the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland, individual public servants, and pensioners, as well as the taxpayer. For this reason, the Government is taking particular care in examining the report.</P>
      <P>When publishing the report, I commented on the commission view that its recommendations represented an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the measures in the report as a whole. As I stated then, I expect this to be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes carried out a review of the taxpayer's income tax liability for the 1998-99 tax year when the taxpayer submitted a certificate of home loan interest paid for that year. The review revealed that the taxpayer had received disability benefit and unemployment benefit payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The inspector had not previously been aware of these sources of income. When the taxable social welfare income was included in the calculation of the taxpayer's liability for the year, it was found that he had under paid tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer's tax-free allowances should have been reduced by an amount equal to the taxable social welfare payments he was receiv<Col N="406" /> ing. This would have ensured the correct amount of tax was deducted. However, as the inspector was not informed that the taxpayer was in receipt of taxable social welfare income, the necessary adjustments were not made to his tax-free allowances and insufficient tax was deducted.</P>

    <P>There is a £5 stamp duty charge on ATM cards. This charge was introduced in 1992 at a rate of £2 per cash card and was increased to the current rate in 1996. The duty is payable by a bank or building society in respect of each cash card which is valid during their accounting period. ATM cards are exempt from stamp duty where a card has not been used during the accounting period and for any card issued in respect of a deposit account where the average daily balance did not exceed £10.</P>
    <P>A stamp duty charge of £15 is also imposed on credit cards. This charge was introduced in 1981 at a rate of £5 per card, increased to £10 in 1984 and further increased to the current charge of £15 in 1992. These charges to stamp duty are levied on the financial institutions in respect of each valid ATM or credit card account maintained by them. However, the institutions are entitled to, and usually do, pass on this stamp duty charge to the account holder.</P>
    <P>There has been a stamp duty charge on cheques for very many years. The present charge of 7p per cheque has been in existence since 1984 when it was increased from 5p.</P>

The contracted doctor is also required to make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with him or her or a locum or deputy outside normal hours for urgent cases. Traditionally, this has been realised through rota, deputy or bureau arrangements between doctors which are usually organised by the individual contracted general practitioners on a mutually agreed local basis.</P>
      <P>However, the development in recent years of co-operatives in general practice to deal specifically with the area of providing an optimum and accessible out of hours service for patients, such as the two currently running on a pilot basis in the North-Eastern and South-Eastern Health Boards, gives the opportunity to apply a structure to the provision of such appropriate care. It remains, however, a highly effective rota system that is supported by public funding where doctors are allowed to best plan their involvement. Support for the participating doctors in the co-operatives is also provided by the employment of drivers in specially equipped cars and nurses at the various centres who give back up support and assistance to the doctor. This type of initiative, in addition to improving the quality of service to patients, also serves to reduce the work load of general practitioners.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department is about to commence discussions with all interested parties on a wide-ranging review of general practice which will, in particular, consider the overall workload of general practitioners.</P>

      <P>Agreement was reached with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation in April on a number of outstanding industrial relations issues, through the HSEA. As a result, they have agreed to meet my Department, again through the HSEA, on the subject of the extension of the eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over. I look forward to a positive outcome to these talks, which will commence shortly, and to the timely and efficient introduction of the scheme, in an agreed manner, from its official start date on 1 July 2001.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act, and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention to assist with the cost of care in a private nursing setting. Subvention is not paid to patients in health board extended care facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 275 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was not even intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. The placement of a resident in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. Accordingly, my Department has no function in setting private nursing home fees, nor does it compile information on the fees imposed.</P>
      <P>In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and has recently been completed. The aims of the review process are to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this review was to address the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which current objectives are being met, the efficiency, effectiveness and equity implications of the current subvention scheme, the need and the likely future demand for private nursing home care, the supply of nursing home care in the future, the role of the nursing home sector in an integrated public-private care system, the role of the social economy in an integrated, community-based, long stay care system, optimal funding arrangements for long stay care and the major policy questions for the future.</P>
      <P>Professor Eamon O'Shea, National University of Ireland, Galway, was engaged to carry out the detailed research and preparation of a report. The review was overseen by a steering committee comprising officials of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance. I understand Professor O'Shea consulted various interested parties, including officials from the health boards and owners of private nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, the Ombudsman's report, together with <Col N="415" /> experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 302 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland concerning the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and the 1999 nurses pay agreement. The Government intends to make formal decisions on the recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions following detailed consideration of the report which was published on 31 January 2001. The Government will then move to establish the working group, provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to advise on implementation of the relevant Government decisions. The working group will comprise representatives of the public service unions, relevant Departments, and other appropriate bodies.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations have implications for all parties having an interest in public service pensions including the Government, public service employers, trade unions, pensioner associations such as the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland, individual public servants, and pensioners, as well as the taxpayer. For this reason, the Government is taking particular care in examining the report.</P>
      <P>When publishing the report, the Minister for Finance commented on the commission view that its recommendations represented an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the measures in the report as a whole. As he stated then, he expects this to be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to address specific issues in isolation at this stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the 1999 nurses pay settlement, the standard parity criteria, whereby retired nurses benefit from adjustments made to the salaries applicable to the grades in which they served before their retirement, continue to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> The Retired Nurses Association's concerns relate specifically to the senior staff nurse post, and to red-circled allowances payable to deputy nursing officers, theatre and night sisters and public health nurses. The senior staff nurse is a new post created as part of the 1999 settlement. Staff appointed to these posts will benefit from the rate for the post on retirement. The senior staff nurse rate does not, however, apply to pensioners who retired prior to 5 November 1999.</P>
    <P>With regard to the red-circled allowances referred to earlier, these allowances only apply to nurses who were in employment on the effective date of 16 November 1999. As pensionable allowances are only taken into account at retirement where actual moneys have been paid and contribution in respect of such payments have been made to the superannuation scheme, it follows that these allowances cannot be applied to pensioners who retired before the effective date.</P>
    <P>These issues have been raised by the Nursing Alliance and discussions have taken place under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency. In this context, my Department has confirmed with the Department of Finance that the approach being taken is consistent with public service pensions increase policy. My policy adviser, accompanied by officials from my Department's nursing policy division, met with a delegation from the association on 9 May 2001.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, I have approved the establishment of a project team to prepare detailed briefs for identified priority developments at the hospital.</P>
    <P>The board has recently circulated a number of documents, which assess the needs of the hospital and outline the proposed functional content of the new development relative to the existing hospital site and its role in providing acute hospital services in the Mid-Western Health Board area. These documents are being examined by the project team, with a view to agreeing the scope of the new development brief.</P>

      <P>I support the need to promote a greater understanding of the need for organ donation. My Department is committed to raising public awareness of the positive life giving aspect of organ donation and deflecting any negative ill-informed public perception which may arise resulting from recent organ retention controversies.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I was pleased to have provided funding of £175,000 in recent weeks to support the Irish donor network initiative, Forget-Me-Not week. The initiative seeks to heighten donor awareness through a national television and radio advertising campaign and the issuing of donor cards.</P>
      <P>I am aware from figures circulated by the Irish Kidney Association that the refusal rate for families who were asked to consent to transplant rose from 14% in 1999 to 35% in 2000. The number of donors in 2000 dropped marginally to 71 from 72 in 1999. I will continue to support positive initiatives aimed at maintaining and increasing organ donation rates in this country.</P>

      <P>The development of Louth County Hospital is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. Louth County Hospital is part of the Louth Meath hospital group which also includes Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of £160 million has been notified to the North-Eastern Health Board which will enable substantial improvements to be made to physical infrastructures in both the board's acute and non-acute health sectors. The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it is a matter for the board to prioritise its capital development projects within the NDP funding indicated to it and in the context of the prioritisation of its service requirements.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that it has established a steering group to oversee and prioritise capital development proposals at all of its acute hospital sites. The steering group is being advised by a project team responsible for the planning and development of services in the board's functional area for the Louth Meath hospital group. The project team has drawn up development proposals for the group hospitals, including the Louth County Hospital site. The proposals will be considered by the steering group at its next meeting which is scheduled to take place later this month.</P>

      <P>There are currently two main non-statutory agencies providing personal assistance services throughout the country, the Irish Wheelchair Association, which provides this service on behalf of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the Dublin area and the Centre for Independent Living which provides the service through its 26 branches nationwide.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has primary responsibility for the implementation of the health services element of the national development plan within its area, including the prioritisation and delivery of capital projects. Individual projects envisaged under the plan, including those for the next three years, will be subject to approval by my Department to maximise the use of funding made available under the NDP. The total costs involved in projects are subject to review to take account of inflation, phasing, scope changes etc. In strategically managing the NDP, my Department is reviewing the plan for each board, including the Southern Health Board, in the light of various influences affecting capital projects. These include changing service priorities, building inflation and capacity pressures generally in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Given the scope of individual projects proposed under the health board's plan, and the evolving nature of capital projects generally, it would not be possible for me to provide the detailed information on separate projects sought by the Deputy. Should the Deputy wish to know the current position on these, this information should be sought directly from the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As 2000 was the first year of the NDP for the health services, transitional arrangements applied in relation to capital funding for health boards to ensure that existing commitments were met, while allowing scope for various new approvals <Col N="424" /> throughout the country. The expenditure in the Southern Health Board area for 2000 was approximately £34.24 million across both the acute hospital and the non-acute hospital sectors. A sum of £248.25 million was indicated at the launch of the national development plan for the Southern Health Board area for 2001-06. This amount will be subject to review each year in the context of the various factors, such as inflation, governing the NDP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Nursing students on the diploma programmes receive an annual non-means tested maintenance grant of £3,325 as well as other financial supports. I am increasing this grant by £245 to £3,570 with effect from 1 June. Student nurses commencing the diploma programme also benefit from a book allowance of £250 along with a uniform allowance of £150. These allowances will increase to £270 and £160, respectively, with effect from 1 June. Student nurses are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven-day per week basis in designated health institutions.</P>
      <P>In early 1998, a new allowance of £20 per week was introduced to assist students undertaking external clinical placements. This is payable where it is necessary for the students to find alternative accommodation away from their normal place of residence for the duration of the placement. This allowance was increased to £30 per week in 2000 and will rise by a further £10 per week to £40 with effect from 1st June. Students undertaking external clinical placements also receive a weekly travel pass.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf. The average annual fee is about £1,600. The average annual total value of these supports is some £7,000 per nursing student, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>
      <P>The full year cost of the enhancements to the various allowances is in the region of £1 million. Apart from benefiting students already in training, I am hopeful that these improved supports will help to sustain the interest of this year's 6,000 applicants in nursing as a career.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the North-Eastern Health Board that there are approximately 127 temporary nurses employed at Cavan General Hospital, of whom 58 are on 39-hour week contracts, 37 are on eight 35-hour week contracts and 32 work flexible hours without commitment. A number of these temporary positions are part-time and the nurses concerned work less than the normal 39 hour week. According to the health board, a new flexible working arrangement which I launched last November came into operation on 1 February 2001. This initiative should allow employers to be more flexible in their approach to this whole area. This should be able to facilitate nurses with their requests for permanent part-time work. In accordance with the blue book agreement with the nursing unions, a total of 30 temporary nurses employed at Cavan General Hospital have been given permanent contracts to date under the conversion process provided for in that agreement. There is nothing to prevent further conversions to permanent status being made, subject to the hospital staying within its approved complement of nursing posts. The North-Eastern Health Board has assured me that the number of temporary nurses employed at Cavan General Hospital is having no adverse impact on the delivery of skilled nursing care to patients.</P>

      <P>Long-stay charges <Col N="431" /> can be made under two sets of regulations. Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives shelter and maintenance rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants. Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than thirty days or for periods totalling more than thirty days within the previous twelve months. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.</P>
      <P>In practice persons in health board long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the board meets the cost of all of the person's health needs and, thus, the person ceases to qualify for a medical card in accordance with the criteria laid down in section 45 of the Health Act, 1970. In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is twofold, firstly, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes, and secondly, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Nursing Homes Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 to 1998, which set down the requirements for this assessment. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the Subvention Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and, or, daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was revoked from the 1 January, 1999. (S.I. No. 498 of 1998 refers). My Department advised health boards of this change in the regulations on 22 December, 1998. I am not aware of cases where this practice has continued. Nevertheless, if the Deputy has information she would like to bring to my attention, I will arrange to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under legislation, the issuing of medical cards to eligible persons is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. In making such decisions, chief executive officers have <Col N="433" /> regard to income guidelines as well as to any other individual factors relevant to the decision. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs, or other circumstances, justify it. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget will not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards and have expressed my concern in this regard to the health board chief executive officers. The position in relation to people who are in receipt of the contributory old-age pension and who are medical card holders, as referred to by the Deputy, is that their medical card eligibility will continue to be assessed in the normal manner and I am satisfied that the situation of these people is capable of being appropriately dealt with under the current eligibility arrangements. In addition, in the budget 2001 package, this Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons aged 70 and over regardless of means to come into effect on 1 July 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in keeping with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, health board chief executive officers are examining the operations of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. Chief Executives have indicated the review will be concluded by mid-year. I understand that the area of income guidelines will form part of the review.</P>

      <P>The issue of taking children into care, and their discharge from care, is a matter for each health board under the Child Care Act, 1991. Section 39 of the Act, together with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995, allow for the placing of a child in short, medium or long-term foster care. Pursuant to these regulations, a health board must satisfy itself that an assessment of the suitability of those persons who wish to be considered as foster carers and of their home has been carried out by an authorised person, and that those persons have received appropriate advice, guidance and training in relation to the foster care of children. In matters relating to the welfare and protection of children it is the duty of the health board to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration and, in so far as is practicable, give due consideration, having regard to his or her age and understanding, to the wishes of the child.</P>
      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy has been referred to the Southern Health Board, which has been requested to reply to the Deputy directly. However, the SHB has assured my Department that every reasonable effort is being made to help the child and her family to resolve their difficulties.</P>

I consider the provision of support services for cancer patients an integral and important part of cancer services. The recommendations of this report are being progressed in the context of the further development of oncology services in line with the principles outlined in the National Cancer Strategy. I provided initial funding totalling £300,000 to the health boards last year to enable them to further enhance counselling and support services. Further funding totalling £350,000 has been allocated to the boards in this year's letter of determination.</P>

The report recommends a pilot programme to test a range of new, small scale collection and treatment systems based on design, build and operate procurement by local authorities. The proposal submitted by Westmeath County Council in respect of Castletown-Geoghegan will be considered for inclusion in the pilot programme. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the report envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the immediate catchment of new treatment systems. Consequently, any such development in relation to group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the results of the pilot study.</P>

      <P>Laurencetown sewerage scheme was twenty-third on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Galway County Council in 1999 in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the need for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of that assessment. The priority lists were accounted for in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02, announced last July. Due to the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it was not possible to include all schemes proposed by local authorities in the programme at that time. The scheme was placed twentieth in a revised priority list of sewerage schemes submitted by the council last January, at an estimated cost of £1.2 million. In March 2001, an alternative proposal, costing £490,000, was received by my Department from the council. This alternative proposal would fall within the scope of the small schemes programme, for which responsibility has been devolved to the local authorities. The council has accordingly been advised that it is for itself to determine whether the scheme should be advanced under that programme or not.</P>

      <P>While there are no grants generally available for building extensions to houses, there are a number of targeted options currently available to assist groups like lower-income households to secure necessary improvements works to <Col N="438" /> their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme and the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme. An integrated area plan for the Coombe-Liberties area was prepared by Dublin Corporation in the context of the urban renewal scheme 1999. This IAP targeted five sub-areas within the greater Coombe-Liberties area and was assessed by the expert panel established to assess the proposals of all participating local authorities. A range of incentives was recommended by the panel for each of the five sub-areas and I accepted all of these recommendations. A property may have been designated for either residential refurbishment or new build purposes, or both, and it is possible that a particular property may attract refurbishment incentives only. In this case the conversion of a part of the designated property into a bathroom would attract the refurbishment incentives.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Galway Corporation has not adhered to departmental guidelines in respect of the owner equity requirement in shared ownership schemes and they also exclude single persons from consideration for affordable housing; and the steps he can take to ensure that the corporation complies with the directive in his letter of 28 March 2001 in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway which they have since declined to comply with.</Quest>

      <P>Determining the eligibility of individual applicants for the shared ownership scheme and the affordable housing scheme is a matter for each local authority. From inquiries made by my Department I understand that, in operating the shared ownership scheme, Galway Corporation requires purchasers to acquire, initially, a minimum of 75% of the equity by way of mortgage. My Department has taken the matter up with the local authority which is now reviewing its requirements in the light of the fact that my Department's guidelines for the scheme provide for an initial purchase of 40% of the equity. I am informed by Galway Corporation that it is not its policy to exclude single people from consideration for the affordable housing scheme. Due to the volume of applications received for a recently completed development of three-bedroom houses under this scheme, the corporation decided to prioritise applications from those with families. The corporation has indicated that there will be more accommodation under this scheme, coming on stream in 2001, some of which will be particularly appropriate for single people.</P>

The scheme was thirteenth on the list of water schemes submitted by Mayo County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced last July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>The latest official data on packaging waste recovery is contained in the national waste database report for 1998, published by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's best estimate is that just over 100,000 tonnes of packaging waste was recovered in 1998, giving a recovery rate of 14.8%. The EPA estimates that nearly 122,000 tonnes of packaging waste was recovered in 1999 indicating an annual recovery rate of 17.3%, though this estimate is subject to possible revision. Data in relation to 2000 is not yet available. Repak Ltd. aims to support the recovery of more than 200,000 tonnes of packaging waste in 2001, in order to ensure the 25% recovery target for this year is exceeded.</P>

      <P>Electoral law provides for postal voting by members of the Garda, whole-time members of the Defence Forces, diplomats and their spouses, electors living at home and unable to vote due to physical illness or disability and electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day. Full-time students registered at home and living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State are also eligible to apply for a postal vote. In order to vote by post, an elector' s name must be entered on the postal-voters list prepared by the registration authority as part of the register of electors. An application by an elector for inclusion in the list to be published on 1 February as part of the register of electors must have been received by the registration authority by the previous 25 November. With the exception of members of the Defence Forces and Irish diplomats posted abroad and their spouses, electors who are eligible for, but not already included in, the postal voters list may apply for entry in a supplement to the list which is published prior to each poll. The latest date for receipt of applications by registration authorities for inclusion in the supplement for a referendum is the date of the order appointing polling day at the referendum. The order appointing polling day at the forthcoming referendums was made on 8 May, 2001.</P>

There are nine fire stations in Laois and eight in Offaly. This year's fire services capital programme, which I announced on 29 January last, provides for proposals for replacement fire stations at Birr and Portlaoise, proceeding to construction stage during 2001, and for proposals for improvements to Ferbane Fire Station to be progressed as far as tender stage. In September 1992 approval in principle was issued to Offaly County Council for a replacement fire station in Edend<Col N="443" /> erry and an updated price of £300,000 was approved in May 1997. The next stage in the development of this project requires the council to prepare and submit a detailed design and cost plan to the Department for approval.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a replacement fire station in Portarlington were submitted to my Department by Laois County Council in November, 2000 and are under consideration at present.

      <P>EU Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences requires applicants for driving licences to undergo a theoretical test of driving knowledge in addition to the practical driving test. The Government strategy for road safety, 1998-2002, provides for operation of the test separately from the practical driving test and for its conduct by local authorities in connection with first applications for provisional licences. The intention was that the test would be a written paper based test, an approach subsequently modified in favour of an IT based test to be operated on a public private partnership basis. A prior information notice advising of the upcoming tendering process was published in January 2000. The notice seeking tenders was published in the <i>EU Official Journal</i> in April 2000 and notification of the tendering process was also published in the national press. This process was completed with the signing of the contract on 24 April 2001 with the suc<Col N="447" /> cessful tenderer. Driver theory testing will now commence on 11 June, 2001.</P>

The team has meet on five occasions since February 2001. Its overall responsibility is to ensure the successful implementation of the measures set out in the national climate change strategy including the establishment of necessary consultative arrangements with the social partners, the development of a robust and comprehensive set of indicators at a sectoral and national level, overseeing the quantification of costs and benefits of the implementation of specific measures and undertaking the biennial review of the strategy in 2002 in consultation with Comhar.

      <P>The treatment benefit scheme operated by my Department provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. A qualified adult is entitled to treatment benefit based on the insured person's PRSI record provided he has gross earnings of £60 or less per week and is not in receipt of any benefit or allowance from this Department or a health board, except carer's allowance, disablement pension, supplementary welfare allowance or child benefit. Any changes in the qualifying conditions for receipt of treatment benefit would require the agreement of the representative professional associations. The attendant financial implications of such changes would be a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources. While I have no specific proposals for changing the qualifying conditions or entitlements under the treatment benefit scheme, the issue will be raised with the practitioners in the course of the annual review of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Participants on CE schemes receive a full weekly allowance consisting of a personal payment and additional payments for any adult and child dependants. The amount paid is higher than the standard rate of unemployment assistance. In the case of lone parents, this full weekly allowance is paid in addition to their one-parent family payment while in the case of unemployed people, the allowance is paid instead of their unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit. The declining rate of payment in secondary benefits referred to by the Deputy only applies to rent and mortgage interest supplement payments for participants in approved employ<Col N="449" /> ment schemes such as community employment. Other secondary benefits can be fully retained by those going on CE schemes provided they satisfy the relevant conditions and their gross household income is less than £250 per week.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent. People on approved schemes, such as community employment, can retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000, substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000. The £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in year three and 25% in year four.</P>
      <P>As a result, many participants in CE schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements and this is particularly the case for families. In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of SWA. All CE recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of SWA described earlier, whichever is the greater. The conditions for receiving and retaining rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations.</P>

There are a wide variety of views which exist on the complicated questions involved and I look forward during the consultation process to getting the widest possible input from the various interests.

      <P>Social welfare clients in receipt of non-contributory payments are required, under social welfare legislation, to disclose all their means at the time of initial claim, and to notify the Department of any changes in means subsequently. The person concerned was in receipt of old-age, non-contributory pension from 1977 to 1995 when it emerged that she was resident in the United Kingdom. She died in February 1997. A joint account with her daughter, which was opened on 7 February 1990, was not reported to the Department at any review of her pension after this date. As a result an over payment of £1,288.00 has been assessed against her estate. This represents the amount of pension over paid from 25 June 1993, to 22 December 1995. It is not proposed to seek recovery of the amount over paid in respect of the period 7 February 1990, to 25 June 1993. The personal representative has been informed accordingly.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a standard old-age contributory pension is that the claimant must have started paying reckonable insurable contributions before age 56, that is, at least ten years before reaching pension age of 66 years. The person concerned had already reached age 56 when he began to pay contributions on the extension of pay-related social insurance to self-employed persons for the first time in April 1988. The person concerned applied for old age contributory pension in July 1998 and his claim was disallowed on this basis.</P>
      <P>In order to address the situation of this category of self employed persons, a special half rate pension was introduced in April 1999. This pension is payable at half the maximum personal rate and applies to self-employed persons with at least five years contributions paid. The person concerned qualified for and has been in receipt of this pension since April 1999. Following the budget increases in April of this year he is now receiving £53 per week.</P>

      <P>As in the case of all other social assistance payments, unemployment assistance is subject to a means test. For the purpose of assessing means, account is taken of the claimant's own means and in the case of a couple the joint means are assessed, including income from insurable earnings. In the case of a claimant, any income from insurable earnings is in general assessed at 60% of net income. Where a spouse or partner of a claimant has income from insurable employment, the means test is based on net income less certain disregards depending on the number of days worked:</P>
      <P>Working 3 days or less per week &ndash; £30 plus appropriate travel costs</P>
      <P>Working 4 or more days per week &ndash; £70 standard allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half of the spouse-partner's net income is then assessed as means. In addition, regulations provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for claimants of certain social welfare payments, including unemployment <Col N="452" /> assistance, where the spouse or partner is earning between £70 and £145 per week. As unemployment assistance payments are increased at least in line with inflation, any increases in wages in line with inflation will be more than matched by the increases in unemployment assistance rates. For instance, since this Government took up office, long-term unemployment assistance has been increased by 26.7% while the consumer price index has increased by 14.1% in the corresponding period, a real increase of 11.1%.</P>
    <P>Regarding any further easing of the disregards, any proposals to alter the current arrangements would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of pre-retirement allowance at the weekly rate of £42.50 based on a means assessment of £82 per week from his farm holding. Following his claim for farm assist, his means were reviewed by a social welfare inspector in December 2000 and reassessed at £202 per week. As this is above the appropriate limit, his claim was disallowed by a deciding officer. In the context of an appeal against that decision and in the light of further information supplied by the person, his means were again investigated in February 2001 and reduced to £157 per week. At the time, the person concerned indicated that he did not wish to pursue his appeal. He has since indicated that he now wishes to proceed with an appeal. The papers have been considered by an appeals officer who has decided that an oral hearing of the appeal is necessary.

      <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office is not involved in the arrangements for the examinations carried out by my Department's medical assessors. Medical examinations of claimants are arranged by the medical review and assessment section of my Department at 69 centres throughout the country. Medical assessors conduct examinations in local offices of the Department, Government offices, health centres and, in towns where there is a lack of suitable accommodation, hotels. Every effort is made to ensure that the accommodation used is suitable for the carrying out of medical examinations. These venues are continually monitored with a view to providing good standards of comfort and privacy and, while the quality may vary between one venue and another, my Department receives very few complaints in this regard.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 21 medical assessors employed by my Department, including the Chief Medical Adviser and the Deputy Chief Medical Adviser. They are recruited <i>via </i>the Civil Service and Local Government Commission and a condition of their appointment is that they must have at least six years experience in general medical practice. Their role is to assess disability benefit claimants to ascertain if they satisfy the prescribed medical criteria for the various illness related schemes operated by my Department and to provide a second medical opinion for the information of deciding and appeals officers. It is the policy of my Department to ensure, as far as possible, that only people who are fit to attend are called for examination. In this regard, before a claimant is called, a report on a claimant's current medical condition is sought from the person's own doctor. In the course of medical examinations the medical assessor will have available to him or her all relevant and available medical information, including the initial medical diagnosis, supplemented, where appropriate, by relevant specialist and other reports. Where considered necessary, there is provision for the Chief Medical Adviser to seek specialist consultant advice in a particular case. Any information provided by the claimant is also taken into account.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that claimants are treated in a fair and reasonable manner having regard to the need to ensure that the conditions for entitlement to disability payments are upheld.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 361 and 362 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>In Budget 2001, in addition to the substantial rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. This will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment.</P>
      <P>The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £25,100 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
      <P>As I announced in my budget speech, I envisaged moving towards what I see as the optimum situation, whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>According to the latest figures available from the Central Statistics Office, average industrial earnings in September 2000 were almost £350 per week. The number of carers to benefit from increasing the disregard to this level is not currently available but my officials will forward the information to the Deputy shortly.</P>
      <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes and the measures that I have introduced further enhance the qualification criteria for this scheme.</P>
      <P>In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider that abolition of the means test, at a cost in the region of £180 million to be the best way to support carers or the best use of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others. The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 28 February 2001. The medical details submitted in the application were insufficient to determine whether the person being cared for required full-time care attention. Additional medical evidence was therefore requested and received by my Department on 22 April 2001. Full-time care and attention in this context implies continuous supervision and frequent assistance in connection with normal personal needs, or continuous supervision to avoid danger to oneself. My Department's chief medical adviser has examined all the evidence provided, and he has expressed the opinion that the care recipient is not so disabled as to require full-time care and attention as prescribed. The application was accordingly refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was notified of this decision and of her right to appeal to the Social <Col N="457" /> Welfare Appeals Office. To date no appeal has been lodged.

      <P>My Department administers a number of illness and disability payments to persons who may have diseases or disabilities. These consist of disability benefit, invalidity pension, disability allowance, injury benefit and disablement benefit. The infectious disease maintenance allowance is administered by the health boards and is accordingly a matter for the Department of Health and Children. In the first instance, entitlement to these payments are subject to the applicant satisfying the general medical criteria which apply and these are prescribed in legislation. For short-term payments such as disability benefit entitlement depends on the person being unfit for work. For long-term payments such as invalidity pension and disability allowance the person must be permanently incapable of work. In addition, certain PRSI contribution conditions must be met in the case of disability benefit and invalidity pension and, for disability allowance, a means test must be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Injury and disablement benefit come within the occupational injuries scheme, which provides entitlement to persons injured at work or suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in legislation, where they have contracted the disease in the course of their employment. The occupational injuries scheme is the only one in respect of which specific disease are listed in this legislation. Where a person claims a payment from my Department in respect of disease or disability, an opinion regarding their medical condition is given in the first instance by the person's own doctor. Where required, a second opinion is <Col N="458" /> provided by medical assessors employed by my Department for the assistance of the Department's deciding officers who ultimately determine entitlement. When a claimant is called for a medical examination, the medical assessor will have available to him or her the initial medical diagnosis, supplemented, where appropriate, by relevant specialist and other reports. The claimant's doctor is informed and may attend the medical examination if he so desires. Where considered necessary, there is provision for the chief medical adviser to seek specialist consultant advice in a particular case. Any information provided by the claimant is also taken into account.</P>

      <P>In early 1999, following consultation with representatives of the farming organisations and turf cutters, I announced a package of measures relating to the protection and conservation of bogs that have been proposed as candidate special areas of conservation, under the EU Habitats Directive. These measures included a ban on the use of sausage machines in such areas. The latter was necessary because of the significant damage caused by these machines. I introduced a package of compensatory measures including, purchase of turbary rights from those cutting for their own use who were disposed to cease cutting immediately, provision for the cessation of cutting by domestic cutters to be phased in over a ten year period and compensation for commercial cutters who were required to stop cutting immediately. Persons whose turf was cut by sausage turf machine would be eligible for such compensation. These measures struck the correct balance between our conservation responsibilities under the EU Habitats Directive and the needs of local communities.</P>
      <P>These measures were advertised in the national and local media and also through meetings at local level with my Dúchas officials. I enclose a copy of our press releases at that time in relation to turf cutting in blanket bogs. Restrictions on turf cutting, including the use of sausage machines were confined to areas included in SACs, and do not apply to other areas of blanket bog in County Mayo or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in 1998 the Government decided on a new framework to protect the architectural heritage of the State that placed the primary responsibility in this regard on planning authorities. I should emphasise that my role is mainly to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. Funding was subsequently made available for the planning authorities to recruit conservation officers. A scheme of grants for the conservation of protected structures was also introduced. The new system was given legislative effect through the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. A number of seminars were held for planning authorities to outline the revised arrangements and their enhanced role in the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the malt house is included in Offaly County Council's record of protected structures. It is, accordingly, a matter for the council, in the first instance, to take whatever action it considers appropriate, consistent with its new powers, to protect the architectural integrity of the relevant structures, including the interiors thereto. The new Act also places a responsibility on the owners and occupiers of protected structures to ensure that the structure or any part of it, which contributes to its special interest, is not endangered in any way. I understand the property is in private ownership.</P>

      <P>Since responsibility for the protection and preservation of State-managed heritage sites was transferred from the Office of Public Works to my Department a signage programme, aimed at providing a consistent approach to the presentation of sites, has been implemented. Under the programme a sign sys<Col N="462" /> tem manual was prepared by Dúchas &ndash; the heritage service of my Department. This manual provides guidance in relation to the specification of particular signs. To reflect the ethos of Dúchas work, oak was chosen for external signage for its strength and durability. I am not aware that the condition of signs has deteriorated significantly. If, however, the Deputy can let me have details of particular signs, including their location, I will be glad to investigate the matter further. Signs are provided in accordance with normal procurement procedures, which includes inspection and certification of the signs. In excess of 175 new main entrance signs to national parks and national monument sites have been provided at an approximate cost of £97,000.</P>

      <P>The Heritage Council's report on decay of stone monuments published last week is being examined in my Department. My Department is conversant with the issues involved and, in particular, would be largely familiar with the problems besetting the monuments and properties indicated in the report and has been to the fore in good stone conservation practice. The rate of decay relates in part to the type of stone used in construction, for example, soft sandstone monuments are affected more than limestone monuments. This was particularly true in the case of the finer carved detailing on many of the sites assessed in the report. The time span must also be put into context, as the issue of decay of stone has been ongoing for hundreds of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comments of the Heritage Council must also be seen in the context of my announcement last November of a major £100 million investment in the built heritage under the national development plan which includes an unprecedented level of commitment to the conservation of national monuments in the care of the State, which should perhaps have been acknowledged in the council's comments. I also wish to point out to the Deputy that the quality of the conservation work which has been undertaken by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, in stone conservation is widely recognised. Work practices and structures <Col N="463" /> in Dúchas are under review to ensure they can meet the increased demands on the service and restructuring proposals are under discussion with staff and unions.</P>

The report did, however, recommend that procedures should be introduced to allow families to request reports on investigations of murders, arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years, where no one has been made amenable.

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the article which appeared in the April 2001 edition of <i>Insight</i> magazine. The National Disability Authority was established under the aegis of my Department on 12 June 2000. In framing the National Disability Authority Act, 1999, I was conscious of and gave particular attention to the importance of research and statistics relevant to people with disabilities. As a result, the development of research and statistical information appropriate for the planning, delivery and monitoring of programmes and services for people with disabilities are key statutory functions of the NDA.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the NDA on 12 June 2000, the Taoiseach announced the proposed establishment of a Chair of Disability Studies at UCD and this chair, funded through my Department, has since been created. A central objective of the chair is to stimulate and promote inter-disciplinary research on disability issues in our third level institutions. This is the first such chair on this island. The authority is also in the process of awarding a number of post-graduate research scholarships to support further research in this important field.</P>
      <P>The first strategic plan of the National Disability Authority, A Matter of Rights, was officially launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, who has special responsibility for equality and disabilities, on 2 May 2001. The priorities set in the NDA's strategic plan include the development of baseline quantitative and qualitative data to inform and underpin the planning and development of policy and services for people with disabilities in Ireland, the development of protocols for effectively including people with disabilities in all aspects of research that affect them and the setting up of systems for the effective dissemination of disability research. In addition, my Department is committed, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to review and identify key statistical needs in relation to people with disabilities or categories of people with disabilities for the purposes of informing policy, planning and the delivery of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further important project is also in progress in the Department of Health and Children which will increase the statistical databases of that Department in regard to people with disabilities. In <Col N="466" /> addition to the national intellectual disability database already in place, a committee was established in December 1998 to make recommendations on the establishment of a national physical and sensory disability database. The new database will provide a picture of the specialised health and personal social service needs of people with a physical or sensory disability. The recommendations of the committee are currently being tested in four pilot sites and the report of the committee is expected to be finalised in September of this year. I welcome the additional data on disability which will become available to us as a result of this work and the work of the NDA and my Department to which I have already referred.</P>

The terms of reference of the commission are as follows: to review the liquor licensing system in the light of all relevant factors, including systems for the licensing of alcohol in other countries, and to make recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meeting the needs of consumers, in a competitive market environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society; to review the scope for a system of additional licences; to examine demand in areas that are under-pubbed, new areas of increasing population and tourist areas; to examine other aspects of the licensing system, such as licences for theatres and places of public entertainment, the licensing of residential accommodation which does not come under the definition of an hotel, interpretative centres and other places where the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main business carried out; to examine the nature of the off-licence and particularly the method of access to the off-licensed trade in the interests of promoting better competition; to inquire into other aspects of the licensing code, as may be appropriate; to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes to give effect to the recommendations put forward; to submit a report within three months of the first meeting on paragraph three of its terms of reference and a final report within two years of the first meeting on all other matters.</P>

      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that breaches of the Road Traffic Acts,1961, as amended, are regularly targeted by way of various operations and initiatives under the Garda road safety initiative in the Dublin metropolitan region. I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda operations target specific localities for breaches of road traffic legislation, including speeding, three tonne limits, breaking amber lights, cycling and no left/right turns. In addition, all Garda members enforce breaches of the traffic legislation as part of their normal duties. As well as the regional traffic unit, each division in the Dublin metropolitan region has a designated traffic unit which is deployed specifically on traffic management and enforcement matters. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the detection statistics for the Dublin metropolitan region for the year 2000 in respect of the offences referred to by the Deputy are set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>An application for a staffing grant was received by my Department's equal opportunities child care section in December 2000 from the community crèche in County Limerick to which the Deputy refers. Following a technical assessment carried out by Area Development Management Limited, based on information available at the time, this funding application was considered by the programme appraisal committee. The appraisal committee did not recommend funding of the project.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the assessment criteria for my Department's equal opportunities child care programme include the extent to which the child care service will enhance child care provision in disadvantaged areas, the extent to which the project will maintain or increase the number of places and the extent to which the service will facilitate parents in accessing training, education and employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>In replying to the group informing it of the decision on its application for funding, I indicated that an official of ADM Limited would contact it to discuss the application further. Following these consultations, an appeal against the decision was received from the crèche in question in early April 2001. An assessment of this appeal was carried out by ADM Limited before being recently considered by the appraisal committee. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that on 9 May 2001 I approved funding to the community crèche in question of £15,000 for one year. Further funding for the community crèche will be subject to a review of progress after one year. I have been informed that officials from my Department's equal opportunities child care section have been in touch with the community crèche regarding my decision.</P>

      <P>The information in question has been received from one of the persons referred by the Deputy in the context of that person's application for naturalisation. No application has been received from that person's wife nor would it appear from information on file that she is eligible to apply for naturalisation at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the large number of applications on hands, applications for naturalisation are dealt with in chronological order as this method is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. Extra <Col N="471" /> resources have been allocated to the citizenship area of my Department which will impact considerably on the current processing time and I expect that I will be in a position to make a decision on the case of the person referred to before the end of this year. As soon as full consideration has been given to this application, I will advise both the applicant and the Deputy of my decision. It should also be noted that both of the persons referred to by the Deputy have been granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of an Irish born child, and the grant of such permission is not contingent on the making of an application for naturalisation by either party.</P>

      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy was the subject of an application to the central authority which operates in my Department for the purposes of the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction. The application was forwarded under the Hague Convention to the Central Authority for England and Wales and the matter was concluded on 8 December 2000 by virtue of a decision, which I understand was not appealed, of the family division of the High Court of England and Wales to dismiss the application for the reasons set out in the judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Hague convention is designed to ensure the return of children who have been abducted from one contracting state to another. It is based on the principle that the custody of a child should be decided by courts in the state in which the child habitually resides. It applies to children under the age of 16 years who have been removed in breach of custody rights attributable to a person under the law of that state, provided those rights were actually being exercised at the time of the unlawful removal. The judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child in certain circumstances, for example, if the person opposing the return of the child establishes that the foreign applicant did not exercise rights of custody at the time of removal or there is a grave risk that the return of the child would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or place him/her <Col N="472" /> in an intolerable situation. While I wish to be of whatever assistance I can to the House in giving information about the operation of the Hague convention, it would be inappropriate of me as Minister to comment on the details of the civil law aspects of individual cases.</P>

A completed application form for a capital grant was received in the equal opportunities child care section of my Department on 13 February 2001 from the playgroup in question. I have been informed by my officials that the application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited on 13 February 2001. A technical assessment of this application will be carried out by ADM Limited prior to referral to the programme appraisal committee. Once the assessment and appraisal process is complete, I will make a decision shortly thereafter. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the application.</P>

      <P>The pilot drug court programme was launched in the Dublin District Court on 9 January 2001 and the first sitting took place on 16 January. The court sits on Tuesday and Thursday at 3 p.m. at the Richmond Courthouse and each sitting is preceded by a meeting of the Drugs Court team and the judge. As the pilot drug court will run for one year no case has been fully determined in that the treatment plans which are assigned to participants under the programme remain under review by the Drugs Court team. I understand that, as of 11 May, 21 persons have been referred to the Drugs Court for assessment from the Dublin District Courts. Three persons have been returned to the ordinary courts as they were considered unsuitable for the treatment programme. Seven persons have been assigned treatment plans and the remaining persons are at various stages of assessment.</P>

Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tri<Col N="477" /> bunal, which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.

It is the case that on 20 January 1983 one of my predecessors, Deputy Noonan, made a number of public statements arising from a comprehensive investigation which he had undertaken into certain matters relating to the interception of communications. Those statements contained no suggestion of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that when stolen cars are located the owners are informed accordingly and it is then the responsibility of the owner to recover his or her car. I am also informed that, on occasions, due to circumstances, such as the extent of the damage to the stolen car or the inability to contact the owner, it is necessary for the Garda authorities to make arrangements for the removal of the car. This is carried out by availing of the services of a private contractor to have the car towed to a compound. This is the practice in all Garda divisions throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are a number of private contractors throughout the country who provide a towing and storage service. These contractors are normally located close to a Garda station and <Col N="478" /> can provide a quick response enabling the gardaí to resume providing a policing service to the community rather than remaining with a vehicle until other arrangements could be made. I do not consider that use of Garda resources to recover such vehicles in place of present arrangements would be a justified use of scarce Garda resources.</P>

      <Quest>the position on the repatriation of a person (details supplied) from England; and when this man can expect to be returned home to serve the remainder of his prison sentence here particularly as his case is not under appeal but is rather merely being reviewed which would not prevent his repatriation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13979/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): In my reply to a previous question on this matter, I informed the Deputy that the prisoner concerned has applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in the United Kingdom regarding his conviction and that I have sought the advice of the Chief State Solicitor in relation to this matter as the Council of Europe Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and 1997, require that an application can only proceed where the sentence imposed is final. I must be satisfied that the outcome of the Criminal Cases Review Commission process will not cause future difficulties should a transfer occur. I understand it is possible that if the Criminal Cases Review Commission finds in favour of the applicant, then the case may be referred back to a UK court and that the prisoner concerned may be required to appear before that court. The Chief State Solicitor will advise me of the possible outcomes of the review process and of the legal implications in relation to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of the advices of the Chief State Solicitor I will be in a position to make a decision on the transfer application. Should I consent to the transfer and should the prisoner and the United Kingdom authorities also consent, my Department will request the Chief State Solicitor to apply to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the prisoner to this jurisdiction and his continued detention here. I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to process the transfer application of this prisoner as quickly as possible. However, it is likely to be some time yet before a transfer can be effected, assuming all the necessary consents are forthcoming. I will keep the Deputy informed of developments in the matter.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Courts Service, as stated in the Courts Service Strategic <Col N="480" /> Plan, 2000-2003, to put in place regional management arrangements to facilitate the devolution of functions and budgets. I welcome this policy which is in keeping with Government policy. I stress that decisions in relation to location and staffing levels of any such regional management offices are a matter for the board of the Courts Service. I understand, however, that the Courts Service intends to establish a regional office in Monaghan in the latter half of this year. I also understand that the office will have a staff of three &ndash; a regional manager and two support staff.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 412 to 416, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The promoter concerned undertook to provide this programme to the Dóchas Centre in Mountjoy Women's Prison on a voluntary basis for a trial period and indicated that she would accept the Prison Service's evaluation of its merits. I have been informed by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service that he had this programme examined following the trial period in consultation with the Prison Governor in Mountjoy Prison and the heads of the prison medical services and the prison psychology service. Their collective view is that the proposal in question would not represent value for money for the service.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the petition referred to by the Deputy. However, it should be borne in mind that vulnerable prisoners are not necessarily best placed to objectively assess the merits of any therapeutic approach. I would take into account any objective scientifically validated study which would assist in establishing the effectiveness of any therapeutic clinical approach with prisoners. In seeking to assess the merits of the approach being proposed by the CMSP, I have sought to elicit any such studies but to date none has been obtained. I am not aware of the evaluation of complementary medical treatment referred to in the second part of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals to undertake or provide funding to any further research into this matter at this time. In light of existing priorities and resource limitations, I do not believe that any such study would be an appropriate and beneficial use of public funds. In the absence of objective scientific based evidence to support the claim that this form of medical approach has been proven to be effective, I see no point in the Direc<Col N="482" /> tor of Prison Medical Services consulting with the Irish Medical Council with regard to the ethical approach or co-operation with the CMSP. The initial observations of the Governor of Mountjoy Prison regarding the CMSP will be forwarded to the Deputy in the next few days.</P>

Trainee drivers are required to undergo a written examination and they are subject to a continual assessment culminating in a final driving assessment when a decision is made regarding their competency to drive official motorcycles.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 418 and 425 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that FIFA and UEFA have recently reached agreement with the European Commission in relation to international transfers in football, which includes a special provision in relation to restrictions on international transfers <Col N="483" /> of young players. I had conveyed to the Commission my concern that the protection and welfare of young players be addressed in the context of the negotiations with the football authorities and, in addition, the need for the protection of young sports men and women is also expressed in the Declaration on Sport agreed at the European Council at Nice in December 2000.</P>
    <P>The question of transfers is one primarily for the sports organisations concerned. In this context, the Deputy may be aware already that the Football Association of Ireland has appointed a dedicated officer to deal with the protection, welfare, educational, vocational and career guidance needs of young footballers, particularly in the context of offers to sign for clubs abroad, and in consultation also with the parents and family of the player, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the greatly increased funding for sport achieved by the present Government &ndash; an increase from £13.5 million when we took office in 1997 to around £83 million this year &ndash; has considerably enhanced the range and quality of coaching, training, development and support programmes available from the governing bodies of sport, organisations and clubs, often in conjunction with The National Coaching and Training Centre, in high quality facilities across a wide spectrum of sports.</P>

      <P>The Special Olympics World Summer Games will be held in June 2003 when Ireland will play host to an estimated 7,000 athletes, 3,000 coaches and delegates along with 25,000 relatives and friends. The Games Organising Committee, GOC, under the chairmanship of Mr. Denis O'Brien, has overall responsibility for the planning, organising and financing of the games. The GOC has formed a number of sub-committees to address specific tasks and functions associated with delivering a successful games. I have no direct or day to day responsibility for the execution of the games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provision of sporting facilities, the GOC inform me that it is making good progress. At this stage, all 18 venues for the games have been confirmed. The venues are all in the general Dublin region because of the logistical needs of the competing teams. For example, many teams have small numbers and it would not be possible to split the delegations. Other con<Col N="484" /> siderations are that each team has only one team leader and one medical person.</P>
    <P>I recently launched the host town programme which is an important element of the Special Olympics. The host town programme will provide 160 towns countrywide an opportunity to host a team for a few days before the games begin. The campaign to recruit cities and towns is well under way and I am informed that towns all over the country, including towns from the west, are already enrolling with Special Olympics.</P>

My six television appearances included CNN Daybreak News, Fox News and KTLA, the number one rated talk show in L.A. with an audience of 8.5 million viewers in Southern California.

      <P>I am satisfied the correct decision on siting the stadium has been taken. I recommend that the Deputy examines section 3 of the feasibility study. This section clearly outlines the criteria that were used for selection of sites. A total of 22 sites, both urban and greenfield, were identified by the consultants. A detailed scoring chart is outlined in the study which marks the shortlisted sites under size, ownership, access, public transport and planning. The study concluded that the Abbotstown site was the most suitable and went on to say that while it scored very highly under all of the above criteria, the most significant attributes are that the site is in State ownership and, therefore, there would not be a requirement to purchase land, that the size at 200 hectares allows maximum flexibility for development, that with its location on the M50 it provides excellent road access and that it is close to a railway line. Any study of the viability of developing Lansdowne Road is a matter for the IRFU.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the information available to my Department, the person to whom the question refers does not qualify for the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. The scheme is confined to adults over 21 who are in receipt of unemployment assistance-benefit, a one-parent family payment, disability allowance-benefit or signing for credits. A person must be in receipt of one of above allowances for at least six months in order to be eligible to join VTOS. <Col N="488" /> Dependent spouses of these categories are also eligible. The main objectives of VTOS are to provide unemployed people with education and training opportunities which will develop their employability.</P>
      <P>The person in question has been allowed to take part in classes by City of Dublin VEC but is not registered as a VTOS student by the VEC. She was allowed attend classes as there was a spare place available and the Vocational Education Committee was satisfied that she was not taking up a place of an eligible student. She is in receipt of an unemployability supplement and life pension award from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs &ndash; categories of payment which do not at present come within the scope of the VTOS programme. However, I have arranged for the matter to be reviewed by my officials in discussion with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I have asked my Department's inspectorate to investigate the needs of the child in question with a view to ensuring that any necessary educational support services are put in place as soon as possible. The educational needs of pupils with dyslexia of primary school age are generally capable of being met within the mainstream school system with the assistance, where appropriate, of the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. Such supports are provided on the basis of the assessed needs of the individual children involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the severity of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations. For some children, the severity of their condition can be such that placement in a special school or in a special class attached to a mainstream school is the required response. There are four special schools and 19 special classes dedicated to such children at present.</P>
    <P>In October 2000 I established a special task force on dyslexia to examine the adequacy of current educational responses to the children in question and to make any recommendations considered necessary for the further development of services in this area. I understand the task force has now completed its detailed deliberations and is currently finalising its report which it expects to present shortly. The report of the task force will provide a valuable input into the future development of services in this important area.</P>

      <P>The admission arrangements and the range of courses offered by a university are matters for the individual university concerned. My officials have raised the matter with the Higher Education Authority and I understand that the Bachelor of Laws, LL.B., degree of the National University of Ireland, Galway is a postgraduate qualification, which may be pursued on either a full-time or a part-time basis. Entry to the degree programme is restricted to those holding an approved university degree. In certain circumstances an approved professional qualification may be accepted in lieu of a degree. These entry requirements apply equally to the full-time and part-time options. The National University of <Col N="490" /> Ireland, Galway offers two undergraduate degree programmes in law, namely the Bachelor of Corporate Law and the Bachelor of Civil Law. Both programmes are full-time programmes of three years' duration. The university does not offer any undergraduate degree programmes in law on a part-time basis.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the <Col N="492" /> school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question as at 30 September 1999 was 79 resulting in a current staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers. The enrolment as at 30 September 2000 was 80 pupils which entitles the school to the same staffing as it holds currently.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school has the shared services of a learning support teacher and a resource teacher.

      <P>My Department is aware of the details of this case. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in the area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
      <P>In order to progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's mother which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and the national educational psychological service on behalf of her child. The advice of a psychologist from the NEPS is also being sought in this case, and every effort is being made to find a suitable school placement. As an interim measure, and until a suitable school placement has been found, eight hours per week home tuition has been sanctioned for this pupil.</P>

      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and to improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability.</P>
      <P>Last September I appointed an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from the three target groups. The group was asked to advise on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area. I have recently received the report of the action group on access to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and, as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced last September the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students resid<Col N="495" /> ing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>The action group's report contains recommendations on the eligibility criteria governing the category of students who should qualify for the special rate of grant. My Department is finalising the administrative arrangements necessary to ensure that the special rates of maintenance grant will be made available without delay. I also announced, last September, the introduction of a new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of £1 million in 2001, which will be administered in conjunction with the area partnerships.</P>
    <P>I have increased significantly the provision for the student assistance/access fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. I have also increased substantially the level of funding allocated under the fund for students with disabilities from IR£700,000 in 1999 to IR£1,232,889 in 2000. This fund, which is ESF-aided, provides grants towards the provision of services and the purchase of equipment for students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions or post-leaving certificate courses.</P>

      <Quest>the progress to date on the school completion initiative under the Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13628/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The school completion initiative, which is financed under the 2000-06 national development plan, through the Operational Programme for Employment and Human Resources Development and co-funded by the European Social Fund, is adopting a multi-faceted approach to the problem of early school leaving. As there is a link between non-school attendance and early school leaving, my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service, with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. The focus of the national authority will be the pro<Col N="496" /> vision of assistance and support, through locally-based educational welfare officers, for schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the Act provides that when a student is either suspended for longer than six days, or misses more than a cumulative total of 20 days in a school year, or displays what the principal considers to be irregular attendance patterns, the principal shall inform the education welfare officer. This trigger mechanism aims to prevent problems before they emerge, rather than treating the symptoms later.</P>
    <P>However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough. It is vitally important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard the eight-15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 1998. One of its key objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. The initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. I extended the existing 17 projects for a further phase, for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002. I have secured an additional £4 million in this year's Estimates to further extend the initiative and planning is under way for the selection of the new project areas.</P>
    <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. At the end of May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
    <P>Both the early school leavers initiative and the stay-in-school retention initiative involve targeted schools working on a multi-agency and cross-community basis, thereby allowing for the drawing together of the resources necessary to address this complex problem. Plans are under way for the development of a primary pupil database which, along with the post-primary pupil database, will provide for the tracking pupils through the education system.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that the curriculum provided in our second level schools meets the needs of all pupils. The leaving certificate applied and the junior certificate schools programme have been introduced and have made a real impact in this regard. Improving school attendance and <Col N="497" /> preventing early school leaving are not simple matters to resolve and, in order to have a real chance of success, the solutions must be wide ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment. I assure the Deputy of the commitment of this Government to address the problem of early school leaving.</P>

South Dublin County Council is in the course of preparing a proposed plan for Adamstown which, when it becomes available, will assist my Department considerably in regard to school provision in that area. A further site for a primary school has been reserved in the Griffeen-Foxborough area.</P>
      <P>My Department has already responded to the demand for primary and post-primary school places in Lucan, by approving a number of major school extensions at both levels in the area. It is expected that these measures will significantly alleviate pressure for school places in Lucan in the short-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 452 and 471 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule that is formulated for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and 19 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 564 pupils at 30 September 1999. The school has also been allocated a disadvantaged concessionary teaching post in addition to three learning support teachers, three resource teachers for the Traveller community, two resource teachers for special needs pupils and one shared home-school-community liaison co-ordinators. On the basis of an enrolment of 543 pupils as at 30 September 2000 these posts will be retained for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware of the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, to tackle educational disadvantage which was launched by me in January of this year. The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension and the school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme. Under the urban dimension of the new programme, I am committed to supporting schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class, over the three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the new programme in respect of the current school year were determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 1999. In order to enable Our Lady of Mercy primary school to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes in selected schools under the urban dimension of the new programme, the school has benefited from the allocation of two additional <Col N="499" /> teaching posts in the current school year. The school is also eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £5,171 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned in respect of the current school year.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding changes in enrolment in junior and senior classes, in view of the special nature of the scheme, I have authorised the continued allocation of the two teaching posts under the new programme for the 2001-02 school year. The staffing allocation for the school year 2002-03 will be considered in the normal way in the context of the enrolment situation at 30 September 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of teaching posts at second level are filled on a permanent whole-time basis. Vacancies in schools arising from career breaks, approved leave of absence or secondments and concessionary posts, which are allocated in excess of a school's normal quota of posts, may only be filled in a temporary or part-time capacity. In addition, in order to ensure that schools have the flexibility to meet the curricular needs of their students, particularly in minority subject areas, it is necessary for them to appoint temporary or part-time teachers.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the eligible part-time teacher scheme, EPTs who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required. Most teachers who are initially employed as EPTs subsequently apply for and are appointed to permanent teaching posts in their subject areas. They are entitled to incremental and pension credit for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken in recent years to address the job security of temporary teachers. The PCW agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers provided for the conversion of posts from temporary to permanent status and for an increase in the number of allocated posts which school authorities may fill on a permanent basis. The agreement also provided for the establishment of a qualifications committee to determine suitable qualifications for appointments to permanent teaching posts in vocational preparation and training courses. This committee has recently agreed qualifications and experience requirements in the areas of beauty therapy, hairdressing, veterinary studies and arts administration. This will enable teachers with these qualifications to be appointed in a fully qualified capacity and apply for suitable permanent posts. The work of this committee is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> The Irish language requirement has been removed for the generality of teaching posts at second level. This has enabled teachers, who were previously regarded as ineligible, to apply for temporary or permanent teaching posts. A review of the EPT scheme for VEC teachers has recently been carried out and improved arrangements in regard to EPT contracts have been agreed. vocational education committees now have the option of allocating EPT hours over more than one school and EPTs, whose hours fall below the threshold, 11 hours per week, required for a contract, will be offered any residual hours which may be available.</P>
    <P>The job security of temporary teachers depends on the number and type of posts available. In this regard, the position at second level has significantly improved in recent years. In 1999, 225 additional posts were created. In the current school year 1,000 additional posts were created and a further 400 new posts will be created over the next two years in accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. My Department recently authorised County Roscommon VEC to fill two teaching posts in Castlerea Prison on a permanent whole-time basis.</P>

      <P>St. Cuan's College, Castleblakeney, applied to my Department for capital grant aid in respect of laboratory facilities and general refurbishment. The two post-primary schools in Mountbellew, which are three miles from Castleblakeney and share the same catchment area, have also applied for capital funding. As a direct result of these applications, and in view of the projected total long-term enrolment of 750 pupils in the three schools, my Department decided to examine the scope for developing a single school to serve the area.</P>
      <P>Letters issued to the trustees of the three schools inviting them to consider the issue of rationalisation. The trustees have each replied, indicating that their first preference would be that each school should retain its current status. My Department now proposes to arrange a meeting with the trustees to discuss with them how best to proceed with the future development of post-primary educational provision in the area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware of the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, to tackle educational disadvantage which was launched by me in January of this year. The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension. A total of 815 schools have been invited to participate in the urban dimension of the new programme. I am committed to supporting urban schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class, over the three year period. In addition, all participating schools will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of schools supports for the pupils concerned over the three year period.</P>
      <P>The retention of the additional teacher posts under the new programme is subject to existing enrolment levels being maintained over the three year period of the programme and the implementation of the maximum class sizes within the schools concerned. In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the programme in respect of the current school year are also determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September in the previous school year.</P>
      <P>Some schools which were also included the new programme were due to have teaching posts allocated under that programme withdrawn at the end of the current school year owing to falling enrolments. In view of the special nature if the scheme, I have authorised the retention of existing levels of staffing up to the 2002-03 school year pending experience of the enrolments in September 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings of the survey referred to were submitted to me recently. With regard to the issue of the recruitment of primary teachers, I am aware of the difficulties that some schools are experiencing in recruiting fully qualified teachers. The difficulties in obtaining fully quali<Col N="505" /> fied teachers has arisen because the Government has increased demand for teachers generally by the creation of 2,315 extra posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage, and the number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges had fallen to a very low level in the mid-1990s. Some 291 graduated in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties. The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further post graduate course commenced in February this year with an intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280.</P>
      <P>The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years. Negotiations are taking place with the colleges of education to provide a further post graduate course next year. Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject, as part of their teaching qualification, are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year, teachers employed in a temporary capacity, holding a degree and the Higher Diploma in Education, are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate, pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers, who successfully completed the full time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year <Col N="506" /> full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes. The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I have introduced a range of measures to assist teaching principals in primary schools. These include: the introduction of the scheme of release time for teaching principals with paid substitution cover for the 2000-01 school year; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools, with an enrolment of 180 pupils and Gaelscoileanna with an enrolment of 158 pupils on 30 September 2000, in the 2001-02 school year; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools where there are ten or more teachers, including <i>ex quota</i> posts. These measures will assist the teaching principals in the schools covered by the survey.</P>
    <P>All primary schools in areas designated as disadvantaged have access to the NEPS psychological service. I am aware of the difficulties that have been experienced by some parents in gaining access to psychological assessments, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists to the national educational psychological service. I have asked officials of my Department to consider, in collaboration with the relevant health authorities and NEPS, how the problem of costs incurred by parents in securing private assessments, where no service is provided by the State, might be alleviated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 465 and 466 together.</P>
      <P>The national office for victims of abuse is a serviced office which is funded from public funds. It was established by my Department, together with the Department of Health and Children and the relevant health boards, and in consultation with a wide range of survivor support groups, established to provide information and support to victims of abuse in childhood. The purpose of the office is to give assistance to the support groups in carrying out their work and also to assist individuals who suffer from injury consistent with abuse in childhood. In particular, NOVA provides information to victims on the various Government initiatives designed to meet their needs, including the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the counselling services provided by the health boards. It also provides, more generally, information on a wide range of education and social programmes and assists, as far as practicable, victims of abuse to access these services.</P>
      <P>NOVA is managed on a day to day basis by a manager and has a board of management drawn from four of the largest victim support groups as follows, the Aislinn Centre, Alliance, SOCA (UK) and Right of Place. These groups, which have direct and ongoing contact with the many victims nationally, can ensure that the services and activities of the office are best suited to survivors' needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the meeting of 8 November was to discuss, with representatives of the main groups representing victims of abuse, plans for the establishment of NOVA. My Department invited all of the survivor groups in the country to attend. At the meeting, a draft code of conduct for the operation of the office was circulated. Groups were afforded an opportunity to discuss this code. It was agreed that groups would have a further opportunity to consider this code, and to make submissions to the manager, with their views, prior to a further meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further meeting was held on 22 November to discuss these submissions, and to appoint the management committee to be drawn from the main survivor groups. Regrettably, before the meeting commenced, a disagreement occurred between some of the groups attending, which ultimately led to the departure of the representatives of some of the smaller groups and Irish SOCA. The remaining groups, which together represent the vast majority of survivors in both Ireland and the UK, and all of which operate on a national basis, were strongly of the view that the process of establishing the office must continue. Accord<Col N="508" /> ingly, a management committee drawn from these groups has been put in place. The involvement of the other groups on the management committee will now be a matter for the committee and the office manager. My Department does not have a direct involvement in the operation of the office, other than to assist the office manager, and the management committee, as they request.</P>
    <P>There is no link between consultations carried out by my Department with groups representing victims of abuse, and the provision of funding. My Department will accept submissions and, where possible, meet with any group, which has views to express on any issue relating to the Government's programme of measures to assist victims of abuse in childhood. As regards the funding of such groups, any group can apply to NOVA for such support services, including where appropriate funding, as they may require. The management committee and the office manager will decide on an application, having regard to the size of the group concerned, the support they provide to victims of abuse and their approach generally to the objectives of NOVA.</P>

      <P>Higher education in Ireland is based on the binary system, comprising the university sector and the institute of technology sector. In July 1996, the Government approved, in principle, the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, as a benchmark for future planning in the sector, subject to regular review. The steering committee report endorsed the maintenance of a diversified system of higher education, to meet the varying needs of students, society and the economy.</P>
      <P>My policy is to continue to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third-level systems of university and technological education. The diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained, so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>

      <P>On 26 February last, I established the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland on a statutory basis. The task of the new authority will be to establish and maintain a framework of qualifications, based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners and to facilitate continuous lifelong learning through the promotion of access, transfer and progression for all learners. It will also establish and promote the maintenance and improvement of the standards of awards of the further and higher education and training sector, other than in the seven existing universities and liaise with bodies outside the State for the mutual recognition of awards at transnational level.</P>
      <P>One of the main tasks of the NQAI is to enter into discussions with the relevant stakeholders in the process to clear the way for me to bring the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act fully into operation. The nominations process for membership of the Further Education and Training Awards Council is under way. It is envisaged that the new awarding council will be established in the near future. When established, a further education and training award of the NCVA, NCEA, FAS, CERT and Teagasc shall be deemed to be an award made by the council. Since some of these bodies make awards on a year round basis, the new council will make those awards which fall due following the date of establishment.</P>

      <P>The funding arrangements for our post primary schools have evolved in an<i> ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. I have already made it clear in the House that I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools, represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a <Col N="510" /> valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
      <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year.</P>
      <P>While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
      <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>

      <P>In March 2001, following an assessment by my Department of enrolment trends at Riverstown No. 2 national school, the board of management of the school was informed of the decision to withdraw grant aid with effect from the end of the current school year. The basis for the decision was that, for the current and previous school year, enrolment had reached only five and six pupils, respectively. In that regard, the rules for national schools provide that grant aid is not continued to a school at which the enrolment falls below eight pupils for two consecutive school years.</P>
      <P>However, in the light of a recent appeal by the board of management, including new information on housing developments and potential enrolments at the school, my Department has agreed to review the decision to withdraw grant aid from the end of the current school year. A decision will be notified to the board as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 413 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 371 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and 13 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has a learning support teacher.</P>

    <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments.

Unfortunately, at this time, it is not possible to sanction the retention of the fourteenth mainstream teaching post for the <Col N="516" /> school year 2001-02 as the school's September 2000 enrolment does not meet the retention requirement of 390 pupils.

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, to tackle educational disadvantage which was launched by me in January of this year. The programme involves expenditure of £26 million over a three year period, including the immediate allocation of over 200 new teacher posts and supplementary funding to primary schools with concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year.</P>
      <P>The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension. Under the urban dimension of the programme, I am committed to supporting schools, with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils, in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class, over the three year period. In addition, all participating schools will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out-of-school supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £5,220 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school was not considered for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the school as reflected in its return to the Educational Research Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider further the position of these schools. In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question have been forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. When the ERC has analysed their content, my Department will <Col N="517" /> then be in a position to consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 486 and 487 together.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the revised music curriculum includes teaching and learning objectives for all pupils in the area of instrumental music experience, ranging from listening and exploration activity at junior levels to the acquisition of basic playing skills on simple instruments such as the recorder or tin whistle. Teacher guidelines, accompanying the curriculum, include advice to schools and teachers on the implementation of the programme in this area.</P>
      <P>In January this year, I provided grant-aid of £6.1 million &ndash; equivalent to £13 per pupil, with a minimum grant of £780 for small schools to all primary schools to fund activity in arts education, including music. Guidelines on the effective use of this grant-aid will issue shortly from my Department to all primary schools. My Department allocates teaching resources to a number of vocational education committees to cater for practical music lessons. A review of the current provision for music within these VEC schemes is currently being carried out and will be completed as soon as possible. The need for any further development and/or supports in this area will be considered having regard to the outcome of the review of the current provision under the VEC schemes.</P>

The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension.

      <P> In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations under the urban dimension of the new programme are also determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September in the previous school year. Therefore, the allocation of these additional teacher posts depends on enrolment levels in junior and senior classes in the selected schools. Notwithstanding changes in enrolments at September 2000, in view of the special nature of the scheme I have authorised the retention of existing levels of staffing up until the 2002-03 school year.

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule that is formulated for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO. <Col N="520" /> The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and four mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 134 pupils at 30 September 1999. On the basis of an enrolment of 133 pupils at 30 September 2000 these posts will be retained for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, to tackle educational disadvantage, which was launched by me in January of this year. The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension and the school in question is included in the urban dimension. Under the urban dimension of the new programme, I am committed to supporting schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a maximum of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth class &ndash; over the three year period.</P>
      <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the new programme, in respect of the current school year, were determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September, 1999. To enable the school in question to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes under the new programme, the school was allocated one additional teaching post in the current school year. The school is also eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £3,551 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned in respect of the current school year.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding changes in junior and senior classes and in view of the special nature of the scheme, I have authorised the continued allocation of the additional teaching post under the new programme for the 2001-02 school year. The same approach will be taken to other schools in the same situation. The staffing allocation for the 2002-03 school year will be considered in the normal way in the context of the enrolment situation at 30 September 2001.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to the provision of adequate psychological services for children and young people in schools. The national educational psychological service, an <Col N="521" /> executive agency of my Department, has the responsibility of such provision and is actively engaged in a programme of recruitment of additional psychologists. Each cohort of additional psychologists is being divided equitably among all regions according to the student numbers in each. On this basis, it is envisaged that there will eventually be seven psychologists serving schools in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>The current situation in Kerry is that one NEPS psychologist serves all post-primary schools in the county and a second psychologist works part-time in a number of primary schools. From August 2001, the part-time post will become full-time and a third psychologist will be joining the team. Further recruitment will be taking place before the end of 2001 and it will then be possible to increase further the size of the team serving Kerry.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 54 of 2 May 2001, he will explain the way in which he can develop policy in respect of school expulsions and suspensions when he is not aware of the total number of children who have been expelled from schools in recent years; if he will undertake to establish through his Department and the relevant boards of management, the necessary data originally requested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Expulsion and suspension from school can take place only in line with the code of behaviour and discipline in operation in that school. Such a code is drawn up by a school, in consultation with the parents in that school, in such a way as to reflect the ethos, culture and particular circumstances applying in that school. With approximately 3,305 primary schools and 763 post-primary schools in the country, it would clearly not be possible for my Department to define the particular code to apply in each school. Rather, my Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of expulsion only as a last resort. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act to address, generally, issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. This legislation also provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board <Col N="522" /> with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a country-wide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second-level schools </P>
    <P>This Act requires the board of management of a school to consult with the principal, teachers, parents and relevant educational welfare officer in order to prepare a code of behaviour and discipline for that school. The Act requires schools to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances, the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try and identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned. This board, when fully operational, will be required to develop policies in relation to expulsions and suspensions.</P>
    <P>As outlined in my earlier reply, the Education Act has made provision for new appeal procedures in order to address grievances at school level, including expulsion. In relation to a decision of a school to expel, or suspend for a period longer than 20 days, an appeal may be made to the Secretary General of my Department. These appeal procedures will bring a greater transparency to decisions by schools in relation to expulsion and also promote fair procedures at school level. In particular, the right to appeal to a national appeals committee, in relation to a decision by a school to expel, will bring a better balance to the rights and obligations of all concerning the whole issue of expulsion and suspension from schools.</P>

      <P>In view of the large number of major primary school building projects dealt with by my Department since this Government took office, the information is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy. If the Deputy requires information on design teams appointed to individual building projects, I will be happy to provide the details. In regard to the selection of consultants, my Department advertises in the national newspapers for a panel of design consultants approximately every two years. The purpose of the panel is to ensure that design team consultants are drawn from as wide a pool as possible. <Col N="523" /> All consultants who apply and who meet the basic criteria relating to qualification for membership of the relevant professional bodies, are placed on the panel.</P>
      <P>The panel is only used in respect of commissions for projects that are not subject to the EU Services Directive &ndash; 92/50/EEC as amended by Directive 97/52/EC. Accordingly, if the fees for a project are likely to exceed the relevant threshold, it must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Consultants are drawn from the panel for projects below the EU threshold as and when commissions become available. If the board of management of a school indicates a preference for a particular consultant before the project is initiated, the Department takes account of this as far as possible.</P>

      <P>I have arranged for an official of my Department to follow up on the correspondence referred to in the Deputy's question and to arrange for a reply. I am informed, however, that the detailed points made in the school's correspondence in regard to the marking of the candidate's Irish script were fully considered at the time. The script was fully re-marked in accordance with the original marking scheme, by an experienced examiner other than the original examiner. This re-marking, while it resulted in some changes in the marks awarded, did not result in a grade change.</P>
      <P>The objective of the appeal process is to detect and correct any error that may have occurred in the original marking and, in doing so, to ensure that all candidates are treated in a fair and even-handed manner. In essence, the correspondence from this candidate's school argues that the candidate should have been marked more leniently in parts of the work presented and that the candidate should have received an upgrade as the revised mark was very close to the next grade boundary. The appeal process did not uphold this view.</P>
      <P>The appeal process is not about marking more leniently, so that a candidate can secure a particular grade, rather it is about ensuring that a candidate's work was marked properly, according to the standard set in the marking scheme that applied to the work of all candidates at the examination.</P>
